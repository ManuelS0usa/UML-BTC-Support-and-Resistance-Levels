[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so on the bitcoin chart here, we have come down today to the 19k level
that was one of the target levels that i gave you earlier today
yeah, we found support at this nineteen thousand dollar level
he had nineteen thousand six hundred, that's the fifty percent fit retracement, and then the sixty 618, which is the nineteen thousand dollar level
we briefly went below it, but within an hour we recovered again
and we're not dancing on the 618 fibonacci retracement level, the most relevant fibonacci retracement level
the problem that we have here is that we really should not retrace much more
so as you know, for the last, probably couple of weeks here, since the low, we have been investigating the case for a possible bullish breakout
as i always say in my videos, we want to see evidence in the elliott wave patterns, but also price confirmation
there were two levels of price confirmation we needed to get therefore always indicated on this chart
this break above this level would have allowed us to move to the next stage, between 23k and 233 k
i've been telling you for the last few days, or here, last couple of weeks, really, that a move above this level would make me consider to make a breakout scenario to the upside
and also, we have invalidated a couple of bullish scenarios here in the last few days, making it just less likely that we still are in a breakout scenario
we can still give bitcoin a chance here, as per this scenario, and this is the scenario that we've been talking about now for a while
um, this has always been here, the sort of the alternative scenario on the chart of the bullish breakout scenarios
um, i always told you that it's possible that the wave 2 here in purple might never have finished as we moved up here
so in the end, it's looking like that this here was a wave one, and this is a wave two, a one, a, two
and then in the wave two, here the abc with an overshooting wave b
if bitcoin breaks below 18 500, yeah, which is, and again, shouldn't have taken it out here
the fib levels, if we look at these fibonacci retracement levels, i would give it the chance still to break out to the upside here, until it breaks below eighteen thousand three hundred eighty four
but if we really close daily below the level eighteen thousand three hundred eighty four, it is just getting very, very unlikely that we still are in a breakout scenario to the upside
and i always try to make you aware of things before they happen
so when we started to sketch here the breakout scenarios, we were around about here, i believe, sort of around the 19th, 20th of june, after we hit here, this target area for a possible low at 17 500
we have been following this price chart now for pretty much a couple of weeks
and we see that bitcoin, so far hasn't used its opportunity to really create a more sustainable breakout
but i have to say very clearly, the way we are coming down here, it gives me a bit of a headache
and i have to say that, um, but again, i've always emphasized, as long as we go above this resistance area here, there is still significant downside potential
and we have to just expect still lower prices, even though we were tracking here bullish scenarios
but this was basically, and i've mentioned a few times, because we want to know as soon as possible if a breakout occurs or not
as i said, yeah, there's still a chance, and the chance should be used above 18 384
so if we zoom in now to the one hour chart here, in this c wave, which in which we currently are off the wave two, um, you can see that we are coming down here
waves as complete in this wave five, of the wave c, of the wave two
um, i've also shared it with the telegram members earlier on the the signals channel
we so first of all, in the earlier video today, we were around around about here, and i told you we'll probably see a way four to the upside, which happened, um
and now this could be complete, but it is too early to confirm that we go up
to get evidence that we will indeed move up from here, we would need to go above 19 300
it would rather be an indication, but it's, it's an important one
so 19 300, above that, we would get a clue that this um downward move in the wave 2 is finished
bitcoin still can go, in this scenario, in my opinion, to 18 400
this would all still be covered by my yellow target area that i've been having yet
i've, i had this on the chart since we're for a week, pretty much here, this yellow box
um, so as long as we stay in this yellow target box for a possible trend reversal
if we go below this, then i think we have to get very accustomed to the idea that we will make a lower low here for bitcoin, below 17 500
yeah, what you also need to understand, for the last seven months, i've been telling you that we will go down lower, until we finally came into my target area, below 286
and even when we came below it, i told you we will get lower, because the shorter time frame, elite wave count suggested this
this here was for the and it still is, for the first time in seven months, the first serious opportunity that bitcoin has to turn around
um, looking, however, like how this stock market is looking like, looking like how that developed over the last few days
and looking at other cryptos like um matic, for example, which of all cryptos was the strongest one on the way up here, the absolute strongest one
and if not even the strongest altcoin, yeah, um of this latest here the price price action made it
i mean, how is bitcoin gonna make it? yeah, and bitcoin was not as strong
so all eyes need to be on that eighteen thousand three hundred eighty four dollar level, the seventy 786 fip level
and you know, the very last chance, the very last exit on the motorway for bitcoin for a bullish reversal is here, the 18k level
but the move below that will most likely trigger a move below 175 k as well
but then i'm going to sketch out, also in more detail here, how a possible wave to the downside could look like with target levels
so, um, i would want to wait a little bit until we get the first larger retracement
yeah, that we get basically here, wave one down, a wave two up, to be able to calculate more specifically where we would land
at the moment, this is a pretty large target area here, below um, starting at 20, 174 k, going down to 106
as soon as we see a little bit more structure in the way down here
um, but again, you know, the bullish scenario is still there, but, um, yeah, it is
just now, you know, a lot of very, uh, a lot of the, or a couple of bullish scenarios have been invalidated
you know, that's the purpose of looking at this from an elite wave point of view, to understand how likely is a trend reversal
and at the moment, the elite waves show us that of the bullish possibilities we had, you know, quite a few have been invalidated
there's pretty much this one left that i've shown you, and if we go below a certain level, it will just get very unlikely
and, yeah, from that point of view, here we are, looking currently at this scenario
and, um, i can give you one target level for a low here, and that would be based on the length of the wave one
take the length of the wave one, add it to the wave four high, and that gives us the first target area for coming down
and that is here at 16822 k okay, 168 k, pretty much this is where we have a good chance to go into, in a way, five
so it could very well be, as just emphasized in the video, i've always emphasized that, that there is still a risk for one more lower low but there is a good chance that the next one will then be the lowest one and the last one before we have another chance for a reversal to the upside

[Music], yeah, hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so today's drop here that we've seen was quite significant, but not necessarily a surprise in the current scenario
yeah, we are still in the area which is covered by the current scenario
and in fact, in the previous video today, i informed you that i believe we are still going to see more downside in the current uh scenario, on the lower level wave count here
a few people have asked again, to just sort of touch base on where we are on a higher level time frame for bitcoin
i sometimes forget that a lot of new viewers are coming in all the time
this is the first impulsive wave, um, that was that peaked in april 21
we currently either still are in the wave 2, which is the corrective wave, which is that larger correction, which is currently ongoing, or we are already coming out of it
we have to and you know, obviously, viewers who've been with me since since the beginning, or since november, will know that it was very certain, um, that we would go into this price range, below 286 k, eventually
so from that point of view, the elliott wave scenario has been fulfilled
and now, because we have reached this target area, um, and also the on the lower levels, then we were able to specify that further
however, the market needs to decide if it wants to turn around or not
now, if it does turn around, i can tell you that all the requirements for the correction have been fulfilled
in the chart, you had it turned around, for example, here, where a lot of people were still super bullish on bitcoin, it would have been a massive problem
this is the, this was back then, the alternative scenario that i told you we could even, uh, had we broken here above a certain level, we could have moved up all the way maybe to 65k
it was very clear that we would have to go below the low of june 21, below 286 k
now, since we have reached that area, yeah, we looked at the lower level wave counts very specifically
and also, on the lower level wave counts, we completed this scenario from that point of view, it is all ready now to start to go up
which is why we're looking for signs that the overall downtrend could be over um
but we need to be very honest, if this is already a beginning of an uptrend, um, because we are still above the the lowest, low, yeah, that we've made
if this is already the beginning of an uptrend, it is just very, very early days
and until we can establish a higher level elliott wave pattern that shows an uptrend, there will be uncertainty
the same way as i could not tell you here at 70k that we would go down to 286k
so there is an element, yeah, that you just have to, let's say, sacrifice, where you have an element of uncertainty, because in a certain range, a lot of scenarios are possible
that is why it might sometimes sound at the moment that, yeah, we can go up, we can go down
at the moment, the the options are pretty much very, very similar, very similar probability to the upside and the downside
and that is purely the case because bitcoin has completed all requirements to complete this overall correction
and this is just what it is, you know, sort of in the first, like, the first 10 percent of an uptrend, the first 20, no, let's say the first 10 percent of an uptrend, they're usually the most uncertain ones and the most expensive ones, because if you buy in very early, it could very well be the downtrend is still at play
now, the wave two consists of a wave a, an overshooting wave b, and a wave c to the downside
and we would then expect, in an ideal case, a move up in a wave 3 that would go above 100k all the way up to possibly even 150, 175 k, but an ideal and ideal level for that would be 125 000 for the next larger wave up, the wave three
but what i also need to tell you very clearly, the next rally to the upside does not necessarily need to be that wave 3
there are other possibilities possible before a wave 3 even starts
so just if i tell you that a rally is due soon, which i do expect at some point, yeah, very soon, which other people don't
a lot of people expect another yearlong correction or something, which does not exclude the possibility for a rally
i'm telling you, we could still get a rally in a crypto winter, for example
if you want to get some more detail about different options that could be emerging here, feel free to join as a channel member
you can watch all live streams, uh, since i started doing them last year
and every live stream includes a topic, so there's a lot of learning
so looking at the lower level wave count here, where are we for bitcoin? this is the bullish scenario, maybe let's let me show you the bearish scenario first, because a lot of people asked, um, so bearish scenario? we came down here in a wave three on the 12th of may
i've been telling you throughout this entire period that the downtrend, the downtrend cannot be over yet
so that five wave move down, we if we structure this wave four differently, we can count five waves complete down here
and that is the bullet scenario, which we're going to take a look at in a minute
but here in the barrier scenario, we may we made one, two, three, down, four up here, and we're now rolling over into a wave five
that way, five could go down, in my opinion, as low as 10 point, 106 k
if we go below that, yeah, in my opinion, it would be highly, highly unusual, and would surprise me
um, i would not necessarily be surprised to go down to 106k, yeah
because this is all covered by the current higher level elite wave pattern
the 106k level is purely the 887 percent flip level, an absolute valid target for a wave 2 um
however, it would be quite an extreme case for bitcoin to go down to 106
going below 106 would be bad for bitcoin, yeah, because it would be below a very critical level
so, but this is the bearish scenario to to really um unlock that barrier scenario
if we drop below the low of the wave 3 here, then we are in the bearish scenario
until then, we can count this bullish um, unfortunately, or fortunately, however you want to look at it
so in a bullish scenario, we made the low here, the wave 5, on the 18th of june, at 17 and a half k
told you from the beginning that this can be counted as an impulse, it can be bullish
now, this was always on the radar, that we could have just have here, head here, and, yeah, an overshooting wave b
now here in the bullish, in the bullish view, in the bullish perspective
in this wave c that you can see, the wave c consists, again, of five waves, and we've made here in the c wave, the wave one down in five waves, the wave two up, the wave three down here in brackets, so let me take out the sub waves
i informed the telegram members on the signals channel that i expect a move up, in a way, four
told you, the wave 5 hasn't really been started, hasn't been completed yet
the way this is coming across at the moment is um as a five wave move
over wave five, there will be a small wave four to the upside, and then a away five to the downside
i told you in a previous video here that there are two possibilities to find support
however, the wave count would suggest we are not finished yet
um, because the wave three came down quite strongly, the wave three of the wave five
so i would not be surprised to get somewhere here into the region between the seventy eight point six percent flip level and the sixty one point eight
and this might actually become here, this target that i talked about before
because a target for a wave 5, yeah, would be, let's take a look at that
we take the length of wave 1, and we add it to the beginning of uh, or to the to the uh peak of wave 2
now, however, as i said, this wave count doesn't really suggest it yet
so we could take another attempt to calculate the target differently
also, a very viable way of calculating the target, is to take the length of the wave a and see where we get to when we add this to the peak of the wave b
again, this would be the next, for me, the next likely target, 18 800
if we go below that, then i think we're going to go to the 786 percent flip level at 184 k here
it could theoretically still go down to 18, which is the 887 percent flip level
it is less likely to go down to that level, and it would be even less likely to go down to 175 k, which doesn't mean it doesn't need to happen
which means if we go down to 17 and a half k or fall below the 887 percent fib level, i would be very much in favor of counting this bearish from then on, because then we are just going below levels where it is not well, especially the 887
if you drop below 18k, it is just very unlikely that this still is a one and a two
then we would need to look at it from a perspective of, uh, what i told you before, that this could just here be an a, b, c
and we're now already in a five wave move down, which pretty much is this bearish scenario

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
nothing, um, that would make the current scenario that we have on the chart here, um invalid or anything, or would make me question it? no, in fact, it is adhering quite well to this scenario we have come up in
in this overall scenario that we talked about in the last few videos, is we moved up in a wave one, we coming down currently in this wave two
um, the other one that we had on the chart where we had one two, and the one two has been not strictly invalidated, but has just become very, very unlikely
but, um, we look here at the wave 1 and the wave 2, which means we're very early in a possible uptrend
someone said in the comments of the previous video to me, my wave b is wrong
it is an absolute valid wave b that consists also of an a, b, c
so we're coming down here in the wave c, in wave 2 here in purple
yeah, yesterday i told you that the correction is probably not over yet
yeah, that we should come down into this region between or of at least 19 600
this target area for this wave 2, it's based on the fibonacci retracements of the wave one
so we've got here the 50 fit retracement, 19600, and the 786 percent flip level here, 18 400
now, um, this is currently, so far, doing what it should be doing
i showed you yesterday when i made my my first video, uh, yesterday morning, that was i told you that we might have finished here, five waves down, and would now expect the fourth wave up, which happened
and we can also calculate here the fibonacci retracement levels if the wave 4 was, um, the wave 4 target was reached
because the wave 4 target is normally here, the 382 fip level, which is around about twenty thousand three hundred fifty
um, yesterday i told the telegram channel members that we could expect here twenty thousand four hundred level, which we reached
yeah, we came all the way up to twenty thousand four hundred, exactly
and might now be in this fifth wave down that you can see here in yellow
and this fifth wave could, yeah, could without a problem, then reach that yellow target area
um, we can calculate here, down here, this target area from a different angle
so i gave you that target area based on the fibonacci retracements, but we can also calculate the target area based on the wave one
and the wave four up and, um, i believe i showed you yesterday the target for that wave five, based on the calculation of this wave one where we use that wave one length, added it to the wave too high
so obviously it could be reached again, and we could start from here
and a good target then would be here, um, the eighteen thousand nine hundred eighty two dollar level
but um, it is technically enough to just reach the target area
and the first level in the target area would be the 19600 dollar level
from here, we could then start to move up in a bullish scenario
difficult thing is, now, technically it could drop all the way down here, and it would still be very valid wave too
so if you suddenly go into the eighteen thousands, it wouldn't be a problem technically
and, um, however, if we go much lower than that, then it will be likely that all of this was just an abc, and that we are actually in a bearish scenario
and we talked about this bearish scenario a few times as well
looking at the other chart here, and this is still standing absolutely
um, as i said to you before, those lower time frames, if we take a look on the hourly, for example, even 30 minute charts, they are very fragile
so, um, here on this chart, don't have the the detailed wave count, but you would expect here, in a way, four to see an, a, b, c
and based on that, we could already have started the fifth wave
okay, so this would then make a lower low below seventeen thousand, 17500
um, currently we can still follow here, this bullish wave count
we're currently just investigating here, this possible breakout scenario, because this is the wave count for the breakout scenario
but i've always told you, since we have started to move up here, and since we could count a first impulsive wave to the upside that we need to overcome resistance
you always want to see the evidence in the elliott wave patterns, but also you want to see price confirmation
at the first level of price confirmation has always been here, this resistance area, um, all the way up to 23 330 that needs to be overcome
and i've always told you, above that level, it will get less likely that we are still in a corrective wave and may make a lower low once more
that um, if we go above this, it could really indicate with higher certainty that we will move higher
now, that level was never broken on the bitcoin chart ethereum, tried to push through failed, though
um, and therefore there is just, at the moment, a lot of uncertainty in the markets, and the charts imply it
i always try to show you the one or two most likely scenarios
always try to show you the one or two which, in my opinion, are most likely
which means these are the scenarios that fulfill most of the elliot wave requirements

and what i want to make you understand that we are at the verge of a big, massive capitulation, potentially all the way down to the 12 000 range
and the next coming days, couple of weeks at the most, to defend this level right now, before coming all the way down to twelve thousand dollars very easily
and also we take a look at bitcoin on the one hourly, having a big, major collapse from this major level
i could have seen a potential bounce or a potential big drop here
let's take a look at the potential scenarios in this episode, guys
welcome back to another episode of bitcoin center's new youtube channel
but i can see here on the bibit competition that you are absolutely crushing it
we were currently around about the 27, 26 yesterday, and we are moving up
i only just managed to do one trade today, and it went in a profit
coming back here to the bitcoin chart on the weekly what i want to make you understand that we are at the verge of a big, major collapse
the reason why is because we are holding the alltime high range, okay, of the 2017 alltime high
we are creating below these levels, but we are getting this weekly consolidation
you know, we can see we're having a reaction at that range, as you can see here on the weekly chart
and if we do lose this major level we did have a large consolidation also here
back in december of 2020, we got the autumn high range, and we got the consolidation of of 2020
if we start losing this range, we could be capitulating all the way down to the 12 000 range
why the 12 000 area? because we went very, very fast from 12 000 all the way up here to 12 to 20 000 back in 2020, from october till end of november
this is how fast we went in less than two months, trading from thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars, not leaving much volume on our way up
so as you know, if you come fast, as you know this fast all the way up to this range, you can come as fast down, guys
so what i want to show you here is that we have left a big, big, massive value area high on the volume traded in between 2018 till late 2020
meaning that if the price of bitcoin does manage to come all the way down to around about that 12 000 range, i think it won't go much lower than that
that is going to be an incredible buying range because we were trading for over three years at those levels, okay, above and below
but this is why you say this is the value area high from 2018 till late 2020
so this is what could happen guys, if we do not hold this range in the next coming days, couple of weeks
if we start closing big, major daily candles and weekly candles, all right, below 18 000, it is almost kind of guaranteed that we will be coming down to those levels
we are breaking our last level of support here, as you can see
okay? if we do not defend this level in between this week and next week, we could be falling to 12 000 in less than one month, guys
hope we will hold it and have a relief rally first, before potential more continuation zooming in
here on the onehour chart on bitcoin, what we did see, what we were talking about yesterday, okay, was two scenarios
okay, this potential kind of inverted head and shoulder scenario
and we also had the adam and eve, inverted adam and eve scenario right there
so this was a very, very, very critical zone here for bitcoin
you could either have a big, massive bounce or have a big, massive breakout, just like you've seen here on the chart
so what now? what could happen? because we have been losing some major support levels
remember, also the value area low from this range also very holding very, very nicely
we did get a consolidation, but it was a dangerous, dangerous level at this range
and actually continuing slightly to the downside, not as much
was expecting a little bit of volatility, but not as aggressive
now, zooming in right here on the chart, what could happen with bitcoin? well, just checking out here, some big, major zones
all right, let me just find out here with fibonacci expansion from this high, okay, to the low, breakouts right right from this height to this high over here
there is something very, very curious, because we have just hit the 1618, okay? which is the golden ratio, okay? it is the expansion when you do create a kind of large consolidation and you break out from a zone
the 1618 is usually a level where you do stop and get a bounce
and just about an hour ago, we just hit that level to almost perfection, from this low to the high
you can expect this level to be defended in the next coming days, potentially before any continuation of the downside
of course, if we do take a look at fibonacci retracement from these lows to the high point over here, we absolutely crushed the 618, almost retesting the seven eight level, okay? where we could expect some kind of bounce
the price of, uh, bitcoin just currently hit eighteen thousand, five hundred and fifty five at these lows currently
also, we also created a nice spike on the vpvr, like i showed you here, on the weekly
if we start closing by tomorrow round about the 175 or even touching 17 000, closing strong, strong dailies at, you know, round about 18 000 or below 18 000
it is very, very sure that we are going to go, in the next coming weeks to that 12 000 level
but if you start continuing to the downside, guys, it will be a big, massive capitulation in a couple of weeks, all the way down to 12k levels
let's wait and see how bitcoin is going to react at this range
and the possibility for a big, big, major bounce is very, very possible, as you can see
we actually shorted this level over here, short of this level over here played out beautifully
i actually did not give any signals on bitcoin on the telegram group, okay, for the bitcoin census team, because here i was a little bit 50 50
we could either get a big bounce from this major support zone, value area low, or we could actually break down, because we had also this insanely bearish pattern, which is this inverted adam and eve, guys, now we need to see what is going to happen on bitcoin
if we start going sideways, it would be looking very, very nice, because we could be having a sideways momentum and potentially create a bump and run scenario
this is only if we are going to start going sideways here on bitcoin
if we start retesting these lows at 18 000 and start breaking below them, guys, it is game over
we are very likely going to retest 12 000 bitcoin in the next coming weeks
okay? this is kind of the last moment, the last level where we could create a higher low over here, get back up these big, major resistance levels that were big, heavy supports okay
and that is going to be very, very good for bitcoin in the next coming weeks, to have a potential larger recovery to 20 to 23 000
i am still not in um, you know, for me, this is either you long it or you not, or you do not trade it, because i think this level can be defended, just because of the weekly range
okay, just by looking at the weekly chart, like i explained to you guys, not much to add
uh, also, okay, for the people that are inside the competition, we're doing extremely well, as you can see here, ranked 19
if you you can actually join the team, uh, make sure to tag me in the telegram group
all right, get your buy bit account if you haven't got already
you got an insane bonus, up to 4 450 worth a bonus, and 30 days of zero percent make a fee if you sign up with my link and join the team
so going back here again here on the one hourly guys, like i said, i just want to find out here if this could be a potential bullish shark pattern
it would have to go slightly lower here at the eighteen thousand dollars, eighteen thousand one hundred
it would have to drop another three, four hundred dollars if you want to see the shark pattern play out
bump in run scenario, you know, claiming this lower, high resistance at some point in the next coming days is very, very possible
this is something that we need to eye guys, if we start going sideways and start having this bullish momentum
you know, i do think that this low, high level, okay, that we did create from 26 to the 27th and 28th of june, can be claimed in the next coming days
of course, you are going to see a lot of sideways action, some more weeks here to the downside
but i think the bears are going to get exhausted, and you are going to get some kind of relief rally
as you can see on the chart from the explanation on the weekly that i've showed you, this is going to be it for this episode
make sure to be super active in the telegram help everybody else in the community
how's your husband, I mean, girlfriend? [Laughter], hello everyone
uh, Kevin, Victoria, Adam, Michael, Smokey fairies sleeping golden immediately
um, please like this live stream before going into the charts, so you can help me with algorithm, and we can grow the channel together and become the best community in the whole wide world, because we already are prison
oh, so I know that I can next time you see me with an eight in my forehead
can we okay, so we're starting off with, uh, uh? I am for real? what? real? good
okay, so looking at, uh, dxy, we didn't have some we did have the news coming out today
let's see on the daily chart what happens where I, I mean, I, I'm not surprised that this actually happened
because every time we're trying to break a previous high and we break, it's just like, you know, when you see, you know, when you see, like, certain candlesticks, like, for example, this one
I didn't look at this until now, but by just looking at the close of these two combined together, uh, we kind of know the market is actually going down based on the huge volatility, and that we're also trying to um I mean, we're supposed to retest this previous resistance, but it just doesn't look good
so I'm not surprised that this actually is happening right now
I mean, this is, this is definitely a fake out that we have, not from this resistance, not from that resistance, but from this high we try to break in I'm using, I always use previous resistance before, uh, these two candlesticks make sense
so from these two candlesticks, this High, what I do is that I use this level right here, because the market would always respect, I'm not sure how to say this, but, I mean, this is a high, but this is the, this is like the, a, a strong resistance the market is retesting
so I don't care about these ones, because these are just, like, not, it is a high high, but these, this is a fake out from this resistance
so when we go back and, uh, so when we're looking at, uh, what's happening right here, we saw the market try to break 105240
and we could actually have seen it, we could actually actually have seen it on, yeah, these two candles like screams the market is on its way down
the market is, I mean, we could try to take a Fibonacci from the low to the high
um, 104623, this is, uh, the 50 that we can come back down and recess
104500, 450 is also a level that we can retest for potential to see the market reverse back up
and, um, yeah, but I'll see a pullback down to 104, uh, 104035, potentially
but sideways Market, we can definitely pull back down to the support again
um, so what does that mean on bitcoin? well, what just happened? when you see, hello Spike
um, all the seagulls is here so you can accept, you hear them
hello, Dana, how are you? okay, so looking at, the okay, so we have already retested the Fibonacci level that I did take from the one hourly chart, and that was at 19 223
okay, so the month, oh, okay, uh, I mean looking at the monthly, monthly, uh, yeah, the monthly is closing today
I mean, by just looking at the candlesticks on the higher time frames, we're definitely continuing down
I would not be surprised if we start to see the market, you know, going down even more
where should I catch a short? I'm so happy to have you back, Samsung
so the only thing now, I mean, I'm, I'm already in a trade on ethereum, oh, okay, so we need to go to ethereum, but looking at the lower time frames, let's see
it's always been love between me and Seb said, what are you talking what are you talking about? um, uh, okay
okay, so right now, um, we could, I could have taken an a trade based on this Fibonacci level
uh, it looks like or we did break the support, the support trend line, but the low is still respected right here at 19077
but we a bigger confirmation would be for me that we're breaking below key level, 19040, and see a potential reach that's not maybe against the level, but I definitely want to see, just, thank you, Wayne
but if you're closing below 19040, that's what I want to see for a potential add of another trade for me to go into
because right now, looking, I mean, looking at the um, foreign, I would not be surprised if the market is actually going down now
I don't know, you know, you know, let's see what this darling can give us
let's see how it looks on ethereum, first of all, okay, just one second
and so I cannot see what you're writing in the chat right now
and if you hear something, it is my neighbors, they all, I don't know what they're doing, but it always sounds like they're like dragging a person dead over the floor
I maybe it's the guy above that might maybe do some workouts or so, but it definitely doesn't sound good
I'm like, who died? what did I do? okay, so it's 52 minutes left of the six hourly candle
uh, just one second, I'm gonna, I don't even know if that okay
if what? what? why is my why are you doing this to me? what's happening? what's happening? what's the entry price? you go, market execution
what do you mean? what's the entry price? I do Market execution
I don't understand why my buy, why why my computer is, uh, does anyone else have some problem when it comes to, when it comes to trading view? because ain't working
is this really happening to me? is this really happening to me? what? okay, no affirmations today
so the target overall on bitcoin, I mean, we don't have to have where I don't have, I can obviously take some other ones
can you see? even? I'm not gonna take out this in in advance, but it looks pretty good when when this happens, right? hey, Michael, don't talk to AJ like that
so if the market drops back down to take profit one, it will give us a notification
because smoking Joe never talks about anything that he want me to look at, because he's so good himself
so I can actually go in and take a little look at what you you're doing
smoking Joe, um, where is the profit? I mean, this actually looks really good
this is why we love Smokey Joe, uh, the entry at 80? oh, right here
and we close below this previous resistance right here, after we retested the Fibonacci levels also
because, you know, we all, I always think about where I have my entry, where I can take my stop loss, right? and we are right now retesting A Fibonacci level at 080, uh, dollars, um
but definitely another confirmation, um, if you missed it, we can, uh, I can wait for the market to break the support, come back up for Rita's then Market drop, but it will be kind of the same price the market will come to we are right now
but that is only a another confirmation that this trade will be, I mean, I already shorted the other coin and the other thing, so, but that is only so I know for sure, sure, if I want to be a little bit more 100
for the people who never trade the market, usually, that is a great confirmation that the market will break the previous lower high at 79, create the lower low, come back up, retest the a lower high and then drop
and so, yeah, I mean, you're on, you you're all already in the trade
so I would not be surprised if we start to see the market move back down now, um, same thing here
um, another confirmation to going to be more sure that this will actually happen, is that we're breaking below a previous, either the previous resistance at 212, or or the support at 212, anyway, and then see the market retest, close below the the previous high, and then see the drop
so that is only a very good confirmation if I would choose to go into the but, I mean, fathers, you were already in the trade, so, but if this, if this is valid, take profit
I would leave it as a little bit with space in case a fake out would happen
why are you putting so much lines in their heads up? why are you lying? okay, we can go back to ethereum, though, because we never went through it
if you haven't already liked the video, please go inside and do that, so you can help me grow the channel together with you guys
so we can help people to look at the charts in a very simple way
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buyers up to 4 and 450 by using the link in the description down below the video
and Vivid is great, um, because when we're holding positions, the market they gave us the low fees is beautiful
we are inside a Fibonacci level now, exactly between 100, 1034 and 1027
this is a very, I mean, you can see that the market starts just to consolidate on the higher time frame, same thing
so this is very important to understand, that we are actually consolidating inside a Fibonacci level at 618 and 50
um, so, yeah, this is definitely also a sign I need to go into
what is it? um? sell by market, sub by market in 1919 on the clock
xrp, looking at the higher time frames perspective, we have one huge Candlestick on The Daily today, so we've been very volatiled
we can also use this little baby right here on the daily that we are breaking above
so this line that I take, took was from the three daily chart because that was the close of, like, billions of weeks combined
with the Fibonacci that is slightly above the previous or exactly at that level at 33 200, if we want to be precisely
and, I mean, these are the levels that I that I will would look for the market to slowly reverse back down
if we see the market pull back up to these levels around 3200, and then slowly, instead of see the market reverse, this is the area where I would look for a a short position
um, if the market continues to, uh, you know, give us green candlesticks
obviously these levels will not be valid, but everything depends on how, everything depends on how, oh, Crossing down
but, yeah, these are the levels between 3085, or potentially the 50 at 3163 or 3 200
these are the levels where I can expect the market, I did have an, no, this would, no, no, no, no, no
but, I mean, it kind of, it looks, by looking at the Candlestick, it looks like we're going down
Natalie, are you part of the wsot by bit competition? no, I'm not, but I want to be in it
um, Andy said that they're gonna have another competition around at the end of this year, and I want to, I want to be in that one by that time
and by that time, guys, everyone here will be very good Traders
so what are we gonna do? we're gonna collect a team, and we're just gonna win, right? I mean, it's not even a question
why can't we be good Traders? huh? who's stopping who's stopping us? so let's say now, until that happens, we're gonna sit every single day until that day they open that um Challenge, and we're just gonna rock
and everyone's gonna be like, and I'm gonna be like, yeah, put one one in the chat, if you're happy that we won
and they're gonna be like, oh, mama, yes, but not right now, not where I am
and that said, no, why can't we um smoking Joe and not Power Team? yes, of course, smoking Joe
I mean, you don't even have, you don't even have a, like, you can't even say no about that
okay, what else do you want me to okay, we can go to the, to NASA
so, a couple of days ago, we were analyzing the market at the top
can you see this week? huh? remember when I said a beautiful, can you see this week right here? the drop? oh, my God, it's beautiful
Ada cardano, I mean, I'm not joking when I say it's really hot here
and, like, there's no wind in my apartment is on a vacation two
and I was supposed to go and buy a fan today, but that never happened
so we, I think we're at very good positions right now for the market to for to be in some cell positions
how are you? okay, so this Candlestick is closing in one in two, one minute
how does it look on the five minutes chart? it looks like we can pull back up a little bit
I've never traded this one before, so I just have to see how no
well, when I saw the market, it just like slammed to the upside
okay? and Bitcoin, we're at entry at Bitcoin ethereum also obviously, look
what happened? okay, because that would you have another 30 minutes
I'm gonna move my stop loss, actually, so it gives a little bit space to move for the Femme
but we are also retesting the Fibonacci level at 19133 or um, 19 128
guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
please go inside and like the live stream so we can, so you can help me grow the channel, while I'll help you with your coins
if you are freaking out, it's because your stock, you're, you're over leveraging
where did you, where did you have your stop loss? or did you have your stop loss? um, Michael, yeah
do we have no 2 30, oh, we had some news coming out on USD here
I mean, we're bouncing off the the we came back down and reads as the 19 000 in four days
so it does definitely makes sense that the market, um, that the market is bouncing to the upside
another thing that we can also do, that I usually do when I see the market pulling back up the way it does now
and if I'm questioning my own even if you should not do it, because you you've chosen to go into it, but we always have to remind ourselves that we don't have to be in profit the first thing
when we take it straight, or when I take a trade, you can be in drawdown for hours, and then the market reverses back down
and just because you don't see the profit right away, that it's, I mean, that is just part of the game, right? um, same thing here on bitcoin ethereum
even if we took the figure I took the trade from the 50 percent, and we're still above, oh, I didn't take a trade on, yeah, I did take a trade on ethereum
but I do, this is the thing, so when I have my stop loss, I need the stop loss to um, I need to have it above the Wicks also, because the market can be so volatile
and then, you know, so that things usually happens is when you see the huge, uh push
we'll try to break the previous High because they know our stop losses, because we get taught to have our stop losses slightly above the previous High
so when the market pushes back up to that level, guess where they're trying to go
they're trying to push it up where they know a lot of people have
if we're not seeing the reverse, because we can definitely see a reverse now, but if we see a fake out, is only because they know that people have their stop losses here, then you see the huge drop
so what would be what we see right here, also happened right here, right? so the market tried to break Above This level, but never have had the power to do that
okay, we do have some more momentum now, but we just have to wait and see if we are looking from a bullish person
okay, so we do have the, so we have the the resistance Trend Lane that is connecting this lower high, lower high
and we just might see the market try to retest this level again
um, if we would see more momentum to the upside, this just might be where the the support is created
and if we have a bigger moment if we, now, let's say that we do have a bigger pullback, and my stop loss will get hit
I'm looking for another entry between 19433 or potentially 19 574, and then see the market potentially reverse to the downside
but as I said, we're also, we also came back down and retested the the key level that I do have at 19040, which is a very strong level
so for it to push back up a little bit can definitely be the case
and with that, we can also connect the dots with the resistance trend line
if we, if you know, if we would see the market pull back up even more
um, same candlestick can be a fake out, or, I mean, seriously, just waiting game
I can speculate as much as I can, but we're just gonna let the market do whatever it's supposed to do
could we dump? oh, guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, we are
I don't know exactly how much this is, because gonna make fun of me, so I'm not even gonna say it, but we're almost at 200 likes on this live stream

um, if we are reaching 200 people within three seconds, um, Seb will buy you a ticket to Spain so you can meet him
oh, but we're not going to Spain because it took more than three seconds
oh, well, we were talking about, said we retested the resistance and we're going down foreign
I don't think sepsis even here, uh? I as I started, I also panicked if it goes wrong
but if you trade with money, you plan loose, everything's fine, exactly
you see, it's such a difference between trading with money that you don't have, even if you have them on your broker but, you know, that all it I really need to develop, I mean, foreign but if, even if those like, let's say, whatever amount you have, whatever amount you have, it's always trying to trade with risk management, to be honest
because even if it sucks to trade on a small account, it's that small account will one time will become bigger
trust me when I say it will become bigger, and you will be so happy with yourself
now, when everyone, every 283 people, comes to his place, tell your family, we're coming
I mean, it's better to trade with a small account if you don't know how to trade, right? Andy has a bigger place than mine
so we just might feel this week, and hopefully the market will go down
and all the females were like, really? you really have to say that? you're so immature
what else? oh, do we have anything coming up? I mean, I'm so, I'm seriously so hot in here
what is woman? what do you mean? what the ones that you love? I have learned so much from you and Andy nuts
I trade small to learn, so when I trade bigger, I won't make stupid mistakes with big bugs
if we cannot trade a small account, we, I mean, it's, it's easier to trade a big account sometimes, to be honest, because the small account is kind of not giving you an anxiety
but I remember that we, I don't know if I took, if we took this trade, to be honest, or we just spoke about it a little bit
okay, we drag, if it will not want you from 3435 and, uh, 3161
you know what? why I wanted to laugh, but I don't want to say it
it's about you sepsa, but I'm not sure if that joke is a pro uh, it's good that
we can pull back up to 3304 if we don't retest this, uh, level right now, the last take profit that we do have a 3246
because usually these levels is a are the lower highs, as you can see, when we broke take profit one, we came back up, retested that level
we can pull back down from that level, but if we see some more volatility to the upside um, we can pull back up and retest 33 dollars, potentially 3340
we have one that one hourly candles closing in one minute, in 10 minutes
and nine the 30 minutes to the 15 minutes, are retesting the level again
do you understand why I jump in between all of these different, uh, all of these different time frames? do you understand why? maybe it's just inside how smoking gel
so I asked you because you can see I'm going, like, I'm going, I'm doing like this 24 7, right? do you understand why I do it? okay, so, uh, I'm not sure
maybe you, maybe you mean it the same way as I, because you are a kangaroo
oh, did someone say magic? so why I jump between, in between the different um these different time frames? it's because I'm trying to calculate the the candlesticks, how they are working together and how they're built up
so that's why I'm using so many different timelines, because the market is moving
so what I do is that I'm trying to calculate what's happening inside one Candlestick, and I break down the other Candlestick and I look at how that Candlestick is working, etc, etc
so looking at Matic now, we are, we are retesting Fibonacci level 4583 and 4646
if this Fibonacci level will be valid, take profit one will be 4172
three thousand six hundred and forty foreign someone, someone came in here and tries to ask us for money
and I was like, what? okay, why ask random people on YouTube about money? why? I mean, where's your family? where's your friends? no, let's, let's for Natalie Bitcoin census and ask her and everyone from nowhere about money
but turns out it was a fake out and missed out on The Big Short log
it was actually only on bitcoin, because my stop loss on bitcoin got hit yesterday too, based on that, uh, fake out
why do I look at use the teacup foreign swap markets are pricing in headline? CPI plugging back to a bit over two percent in short order
do you understand it's great? why is very important to use the stop loss above the previous high
it's because when we see the market trying to, when the market pulls back up, what does it try to do? you retest the previous High
and, I mean, we can still pull back up to the Fibonacci, uh, to potentially 45 020, because that is the 618 percent, uh, Fibonacci level
um, but, yeah, I'm in a Cell position right now on Ada, and I'm exactly at entry
um, what does no need to delete those type of comments? I never delete it
okay, so we, so we came inside, so we did have this happening a couple of days ago, actually
and let's see, we're gonna need to adjust the, Nathan, can I go along now? when everyone's shorted, you do whatever you need to do
and this is also the pre uh, looking at the higher time frames, uh, looking at the higher time frames, we're retesting the 50 at 6568
it looks like we can reverse back down from the from from here
and if that is the case, um, I mean, based on these Fibonacci, it's a very high, it's the high time for Fibonacci right here, is it? yeah
so take profit one, six thousand one hundred and thirty six and take, yes, so that that will be the next lower low
guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, you should definitely do that
I go through these coins every single day, every single day, 24 7, it feels like it's almost like that
also, if you want to know more about Market structure, like, overall, when it comes to trading, this has you, you don't all just need to trade cryptocurrencies
you can trade whatever you want to trade, because this is the base of all of the charts
if you want to go more in detail about how I see the market, I have Master Fibonacci right here
so for the ones that want to see a video about Fibonacci, you can call go to this one, uh, below, back test with me
I also have supply and demand zones, which is also really important
I do have multiple videos, and on these, the other ones right here, I just go through everything
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and sixty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is also how you're supporting me and Bitcoin, since you have the link in the description down below the video
how many? how we we opened this Bitcoin? since it's not a big Community, uh, maybe, like two months ago
we have, you know, it's a very, very, very, very, very good, um telegram group to be with
if you don't know anything about trading, that is also really good
you know, we're different levels, but we are, we show respect
oh, what's happening in the live chat? are you fighting with each other? who's the bad guy? let's see
your moderator doesn't let your deliver, uh, let your but um, I don't know what it was about, so I cannot say anything
oh, Pantheon, hello, how are you? whoever started the fight? probably long
can someone let me know what we are shorting? um, okay, so we I already shorted Bitcoin, and it is exactly Where We Are right now
so Bitcoin is at the entry right now where I took my cell order at
and this is what I this is my targets, stop loss, take profits, Etc
okay, so stop loss on bit on ethereum, didn't I feels like I did it
there's no second version of AJ, because this one is pretty far away
I just want to say I'm glad I found your channel, and thank you
uh, if you want to be part of the community, you have the link in this in the live chat
t h, but based on this one, I mean, this is long trade, So based on the few, I will only take the, based on the Fibonacci and the tape profit three is combined with the key level, which is really great
like, right now, I could go in for a cell position on ethereum, but I'm not gonna tell you what you're gonna do
so, I mean, I'm already in a Cell uh, this is what, uh, this is the targets that I do have
if you, uh, took any of these trades, even though I'm no financial advisor, but you chose it yourself, another self position
you meant I was okay, let's go into GMT and sell the baby too
okay, I'm gonna go in for a short position right now on GMT because, oh, put it forward
but it looks so much different than, oh, oh, I was looking at the SE so around this high and we have this one
you are shorting GMT while I'm about to leave my house to earn some walking
have you ever do it within the live Trace like you're doing now? no, we have not
but we don't take, we usually don't take live streams trades like this
we always, we always been speaking about just like, like regular I actually, I'm never, I've never traded the market the way I do now
it's just, like, not so long ago we started, I started to take live trades, and I feel so comfortable right now
and especially in the beginning, it's just like every every new thing that you do, you're a little bit nervous because you're actually doing it live, because everyone can see what you're doing
but I'm not joking when I say I, and, I mean, I think why it became better to me was because I just accepted the fact that it's, it's okay that your stoploss get taken also, I mean, in front of other people's eyes, and don't have that pressure on yourself
and that, I think, that is the whole point of everything, right? yeah
I mean, I could, yeah, I could still go in GMT, because they haven't, uh, he's not so far away from, um, it's not so far away
do you sound like Rihanna? did you ever get that you sound like, just like Rihanna? oh, I do
when I was younger, I actually colored my hair red because I loved Rihanna so much
how does it look on xrp? yeah, so we are inside the Fibonacci levels at that moment, but it is inside the Fibonacci levels
um, I would definitely want, uh, xrp to break below the previous resistance
I mean, for to buy, sorry to sell, the market now is better, because I do expect the market to reverse back down, but we never know about the fake outs and potentially bigger retests on the um
but for for it to um for a bigger confirmation would break the support trend line
you were younger when Rihanna was mainstream? yeah, 2010, I loved her so much, and I still don't shine Black Diamond
what do you think about the six monthly candle close tonight on bitcoin? uh, I mean, it doesn't look good
but I don't, I don't think that the market will, you know, just reverse from nowhere
uh, or, I mean, we can obviously pull back down to 10K that people talked about
so by following the trend, the market is not going up anywhere anyway soon
and just imagine, guys, just imagine guys, when the market slows the break to the upside, and we're buying the market the same way we sell the market, or I sell the market
do you know how many people will be on these live streams? it will be crazy
Lauren will sweat, go sleep in Golden she's, she's gonna be like, you know what? I'm just gonna look at my trades
he's just gonna try to make me look stupid in front of so many guys
that's not gonna be my life when the market starts to pull back to the upside
uh, sell your Bitcoin now so I can buy it and laugh at your foolish more dolls
open it, or are we? guys? we have 248 people on this live stream
tell us and me, where are you from? if you don't know me, my name is Natalie
if you don't know where that is, I will write it in the chat so maybe you understand where it is
right? facts, stepson, were you saying facts all the time that? so guys, tell me where you're from
so just all love to to Angie and his team, and they will win the whole I I know it
oh, my England, Malaysia, USA, Nigeria, India, Mexico, Wisconsin, London
are you Miss I'm always watching your videos and earn good money
so we're just gonna acknowledge that through the live stream so you can tell us what's happening, and we're gonna continue looking at the charts
Michael and Lauren, please call your first kid, Sim your great teacher
I mean, I don't know what we're gonna do right now, to be honest
is there anything you want to ask me? because the TR okay, looking at a to a we are below every trade
every trade is in profit right now or at we are exactly on every trade that I have, on GMT, on bitcoin and on Ada, where I'm exactly at the oh, salt is going to bed now
not how long have you been trading? um, I got, okay, so I got introduced to trading at 2018
looking at avocs, we are trying to break the previous support, uh, a previous support? yeah, at 160, around 16 on the weekly chart
and, I mean, if the other coin is going to go down, this one will also go down
and if the market will break not or continue back down from here
that was like the most Googled translated to Swedish ever, if we're yeah, but thank you
okay, so I I could sell avex right now and say profit one would be 15 points eighty dollars
I'm like, what it does? okay, someone asked me about NASA, and it's going down
so Seb said, texted me yesterday and he said, Natalie, you're not in in a sweet way
he said, Natalie, I know you're really trying, but you can actually practice even more on your English
and I said that I actually really don't care anymore about how I write
I try, I try, but you I know that you guys can see in the chat that sometimes what I write just doesn't make sense at all
we're trying to break the support Channel right now, um, we are retesting it
because now, I mean, you see, the market is going up a little bit
but if we break the support at what, or the price at 11 561, and retest, then that, for me, say, a clear indication to going to the charts
not what do you like more? traveling or Trading? um, trading, no
but I like to travel, but I haven't done it because of the whole things going on in the world, and I actually do not have time to, you know, end up in a country and then not be able to get home
ah, and, yeah, looking at Alex, I mean, from here, yeah, could definitely go down
if, if, if I would sell the market on a box, I would do it right now
but when we start to break the Fibonacci level, the market has already done its thing, and it's not going to come back, probably
we're also retesting this preview support, and the market is about to go down
so if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, you should definitely do that
I'm no financial advisor, but I'm pretty good when it comes to the technical analysis
if you want to be as good as me, you have to practice every single day and take trading as a priority and prioritize it, obviously
but you can also go into my crypto trading for beginners, I have Market structure, part one, part two, where I explained very, very good how I see the market
if you want to be if you want to learn how, or see how I uh back test the charts
I do have some back testing live streams that you can go back and just look at
this is where we're just sitting calm and I just, you know, go through everything
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so you wanna hear, you want to hear how we sing it in Swedish? this is how we this is not sounding anything as you think it does
where is it? where is it? what happened? oh, okay, the babies are going down, and we are in profit
Natalie kept trading and not saying, okay, what do you mean? I'm actually a good singer
I mean, based on the Fibonacci, but, yeah, did I really have that? well, I mean, profits is profit
and then I look at the of course, because McKay is the female version of DeVore
anyone got a good god doctor for ears bleeding? I have like, a friend that is just like Seb Seb
and he was the one that I actually, okay, so this is pretty fun
okay? we became very good friends, and we're friends till this day
and then I'm like, when I call him, I ask him, why haven't you called me? and he's like, because I don't want to talk to you
and I was like, yeah, but why don't you call me? I want to talk to you
and he was like, then what? what isn't that you don't get? I don't want to talk to you
I'm just gonna sit here and sweat like a pig, because it's super hot here
we or, I have a trades on ethereum, since yesterday it and that was from, oh yeah
so this is why you should follow my channel, to see where I take my trades from
I'm no financial advisor though, but, and, yeah, and now we're inside another trade
um, please? could you demonstrate how to pull Fibonacci Tool? uh, you can go into my YouTube channel, and at the at the low back, says, with me, master Fibonacci
so go into that one if you want to, if you want to know more about the Fibonacci, how I so this is how I use it
so you you need to play around with the chart yourself, because that's how you get more confident with everything
you know by with time, practice makes perfect, right? so don't forget that
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to 4450 by using the link in the description down below the video
if you want to be part of our chat, you also have it linked in the live chat
so if you are panicking, I mean, just let whatever led to, just the market move
I mean, you do whatever I but I'm just gonna let the market do whatever it's supposed to do
I know that uh, a hummingbird whispered in my ear that Seb said wants you to put one one in the chat because he loves it so much
uh, but, uh, Elizabeth CJ, Lucifer McKay, Merlin, Lauren, of course
see each other tomorrow in the morning lives on the morning live stream because remember, oh, sorry, Rocky, sorry Rocky, but we, but you can, uh, we look at that one later
what was it? what was it that you want me to look at? um, USD gpy
so one Forex pair before we go, oh, okay, closing with one huge monthly candlestick we're using
if we are closing, it looks like we can close below this previous support at 100, 135450
if that's the case, and I see a retest from below, that could take us back down to 134354, potentially 133850
this is where we can see the market potentially reverse back to the upside
but if I don't see that, the market is slowly steady on the lower time frames
so this can also happen, but you is, okay? so this USD follows the USD dollar
if we see the market try to break this previous resistance, and I see the market close above again, because we just might try to break it
if we break this level, the most important thing to look at is to see if the next Candlestick after the breakout Candlestick, is it closing and retesting, or are we closing above? if we're closing and retesting from below, that could take us back down to 133, 134362, or potentially 103851
and that's where I also wait for the market to reverse back up
if those doesn't, I mean, okay, so these are the two first levels that I look at
and now that we're crossing into the third quarter of this year, we're getting estimates for what happened to the US
and these estimates are telling us the recession is here, which I'll be talking more about in just a moment, alongside the Bitcoin charts and ethereum chance later in the video
first of all, before we get into any charts today, we need to talk about what happened to the United States GDP during the second quarter of this year
because, in case you don't already know, the official definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters, so two quarters back to back, of negative GDP
and by the way, this GDP now page belongs to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, so it is an official Source
but with that being said, their GDP now forecasting model provides a now cost, so basically a realtime forecast of the official estimate prior to its release, by estimating GDP growth using a methodology similar to the one used by the US
so basically what that means is the following GDP estimates are only that, they are only estimates as of right now
and as it says here in the second paragraph, GDP now is not an official forecast of the Atlanta fed
rather, it is best viewed as a running estimate of real GDP growth based on available economic data for the current measured quarter
so once again, these are not the official, finalized numbers, but they are the initial estimates based on similar methods that are actually used to calculate GDP by the US
so even though these are not the final official numbers, they are likely pretty accurate
and so now taking a look at these numbers for the second quarter of this year, Q2, which is, of course, April, May, June
and the Atlanta fed GDP now model estimates the real GDP growth during the second quarter of 2022 is negative one percent
and keep in mind, it is already confirmed that the first quarter of this year was a negative GDP quarter
so all we need is for Q2 to be a negative GDB quarter, like a minus one percent, for example, to put us into an official recession and now when I say us, technically this is only referring to the United United States
goes through something like this, generally speaking, it meets the broader World economy is also going through something similar
and obviously, for those of you who have been keeping up with traditional markets, this shouldn't really be that much of a surprise, because considering the fact that the definition of a recession is two quarters back to back of negative GDP, by the time we actually enter into an official recession, we've basically already experienced half a year worth of recession
and in case you're wondering, the average length of a recession in the United States is between one to one and a half years
some can be shorter and some can be longer, depending on the circumstances
but based on the average length of a recession, we could end up seeing GDP decline for pretty much the rest of this year
and honestly, that wouldn't be too surprising based on the average length of a recession
and obviously, a recession is not a good thing for the price of assets such as stocks, crypto or real estate, for example
and so due to this, we have seen another pullback back in the stock market, although we haven't yet broken below those lows that we set in the middle of June
so as of right now, we're still sitting in a slightly higher low
but obviously the larger Trend here is still well and truly a bearish trend
but with that being said, in around two weeks we do have more inflation data coming out
and let's just hope inflation comes in a lot lower than expected
because if that's the case, if inflation actually starts coming back down, then the recession might not last as long as what people are thinking
but anyway, getting into the actual crypto part of this video
and obviously, all of this is not good for crypto as well, like I said earlier
so here on the daily Bitcoin chart, we're still playing out this pullback that we have been seeing over the past five days or so
but what is interesting on The Daily Bitcoin charts is we're actually setting up a potential bullish Divergence on The Daily Bitcoin chart
as you can see the daily Bitcoin RSI, as of recording this video, is easily in higher lows
the Bitcoin press could keep dumping, and will still likely be sitting in higher lows in the RSI
and technically, what this means for Bitcoin on The Daily time frame is the Bears in this trend are getting exhausted in the shorter term
so basically right now, we're not seeing the same sort of bearish momentum at the moment as to what we saw back here, for example
because usually when the RSI starts an uptrend on the daily chart, even during a time period like this, it still means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, like what we saw back in May, for example, back here
so honestly, while this is the case at the moment, I don't expect a massive Bitcoin dump on the daily chart, like this, for example
but obviously that doesn't mean we can't see somewhat smaller bearish moves like what we've experienced over the past few days
and obviously, if you've been keeping up to date with my recent videos over the past week or so, you'll know that over the past five days, I've been talking about this Rising wedge pattern with a technical price Target towards the bottom of the wedge
and one of the main levels of support I was talking about for Bitcoin on this for our Bitcoin charge between the breakdown here and that technical price Target, was coming in at just underneath 20 000 at this previous low
and obviously, for around half a day, we did find some shortterm supports around that level
but as I said in my last video that I posted yesterday on the channel, I said, if we break below that level just there, I do expect a pretty quick drop down towards around 19 000
when you bring out the Fibonacci retracement tool, from this low up to this swing height, we do have the golden pocket sitting at around 19 000, approximately
and as I've recorded in this video, the Bitcoin price has already moved to that golden pocket
so if the Bitcoin price cannot get back above 19 000 sometime soon, we could potentially revisit this initial low that we formed at around 17 and a half thousand, up towards 18 000
and obviously, that there would complete this Rising wedge pattern
when we broke to the downside at below these levels of previous support, now click into new resistance
and personally, in a short position like this, by now, I would have moved my stop loss at least up to my entry price, but ideally into some profits
so that's in the worst case scenario, let's just say, if we don't even hit the price Target and reverse back to the upside, which is the worst case scenario for a short position, then in that worst case scenario, if the stop loss is placed in profits, we're still making profits on the trade
but it is important to mention that that is not Financial advice for you
of course, you can come up with your own strategy if you want to
and that's just letting you know what I'm personally doing with a shortterm trade like this
and we also have a similar bullish Divergence set up on the daily ethereum charts, but we haven't actually confirmed this as of right now
and the same can also be said about the daily Bitcoin charts, even though we do have this potentially forming, it has not been confirmed
so once again, we have the daily RSI easily in higher lows, whereas the ethereum price action is actually very close to that previous low that we set back here
if if you're looking at the daily candle closes, which is what we need to look at, considering the fact that the RSI indicator, by default, uses candle closes as its input data, and now taking a look at the four hour ethereum chart
and right now, as the Bitcoin in this video, the price of ethereum has pretty much perfectly hit the first technical price target for this Rising wedge pattern that I've been talking about over the past five days or so
and once again, the subscribers on this channel would already know this, but in case you're new to the channel, there's actually two ways to measure the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern
one of the common ways to get the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern is to Simply take a look at the bottom of the wedge, and in this case, that's coming to play at around 900 per ethereum
but there is a second way to measure the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern, which is simply by measuring the width of the entry into this Rising wedge pattern and bringing that over to the point of the breakouts
and as you can see here, that gives us a technical price Target at pretty much exactly one thousand dollars per ethereum, which is pretty much exactly where the price of ethereum has come down to as of recording this video
and also, what is very interesting about one thousand dollars as a price target for ethereum is the fact that that is also exactly where the golden pocket is coming to play when you bring out the Fibonacci retracement tool from swing low to swing high on the four hour time frame
so once again, as I've been talking about over the past few days, we do have a lot of Confluence around that one thousand dollar level
so personally, being in a short position like this, with a lot of Confluence and shortterm support at around one thousand dollars per ethereum, I'll personally be taking at least some profits on a short position, but not exactly closing the entire position in case we do end up completing this entire pattern down towards that initial 900 low
and once again, with every profitable trade, I aim to get my stop loss into profits as well
so in the worst case scenario, if we actually turn around sooner than expected, then the trade gets stopped out in profits
but once again, that's just letting you know my personal strategy
obviously, I can't tell you what to do with your own money, because legally, I'm not a financial advisor
and if you want to know how to actually trade these sort of moves, talking about a short position when we go down, or a long position when we go up, or if you want to know a strategy that automatically caches in profits when we see choppy, sideways price action, then check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen
the video in the top left shows you how you can make money whether or not the price is going up or down
and the video in the bottom left shows you how you can make money if the price is just chopping around sideways
I really hope you enjoyed and I'll see you all in the next video
all right, everyone, welcome back to the channel for another ta episode on bitcoin
in today's episode, we're going to be updating the stock market blues
this is a series where we look at what's going on in the stock market
we're going to be looking at index funds like the spx, nasdaq spy
and we look at these, we look at these stocks and the stock market, and we correlate them and talk about how this is likely to affect bitcoin
so right off the bat, let's start off with the og daddy of all index funds, the spx
when we are looking at the spx, you can see this has been open for approximately about half an hour or so, and the markets have been getting absolutely decimated, uh, since the spx has opened
and if you can see up at the top right of my screen, you may notice that i do have my phoenix open
i like to short solana because it's almost very, very easy, and it's very highly reactive, so it's very, very quick to have these nice trends
it is looking like it is time to be once again setting up shorts
i'm really here to show you that we have had a price gap and we are moving to the downside
now why is it important that we've got a price gap? well, we see it time over time when we're looking at the nasdaq
i'll specifically show you with the spy, what happens when we have a price gap in a particular direction
we had a price gap, and we opened the gap lower than all the way up here
so we basically had a breakdown price gap, and we saw continuation all the way down here
what do we do again? we had another price gap in the downwards direction
and we proceeded to move to the downside for about another 24 hours or so before we started moving back up what happened once we filled this diamond bottom? uh, diamond bottom formation? well, we had a price gap to the upside
what do you think happened after? we had a price gap to the upside? and we had another price gap to the upside and another price gap to the upside
as you can see, it always, oh, i want to say always, i take that back
we almost always have continuation in the direction that we get
so why is this important? once again, we're having a massive gap to the downside today
this highlights the, uh, basically, retail confidence, consumer confidence, is absolutely through the floorboards right now
so we're going to head over to some slight news before we jump back in charts
if you do want to follow me over on twitter, once again, i am going to shamelessly plug this at 618 underscore cowboy
if you do want to follow me, i share daily news analysis and memes
i specifically made comments to the inflation in spain in the past couple of days
spain's cpi, which is the consumer price index is its highest that it's ever been in 37 years, coming up to 102 percent
i basically said, in my opinion, it's very, very likely for the ecb, which is the european central bank, to continue with its interest rate hikes, just like we've been seeing in europe, just like we've been seeing in the us
and as you can imagine, you know, specifically, everyone looks at the us
when we look at the fomc meetings, the past couple of fomc meetings, we've been seeing interest rate hike after interest rate hike
when you raise the interest rates, it makes it more costly for businesses, traders, whatever you have it, to borrow money
if you're a business and you want, if you're a small business starting up, it makes it very, very hard to borrow money and borrow money and expand your business
and traders like michael saylor that use leverage to buy up bitcoin and subsequently push up the price, it's becoming harder for them to borrow money with the interest rate hikes going through the roof
but what you can see is inflation is running rampant all over europe right now, especially in spain
a lot of people are getting out of bed recently talking about the decrease in german inflation
i would just like to highlight, if you are going to be talking about, you know, uh, german inflation going down for like, a small period of time, you should probably look at the cpi in all of europe, because germany is just one country in europe
and if we look at, you know, italy, we look at france, we look at spain, all of these inflation, all of the cpi, which is the consumer price index measuring a basket of goods for the common consumer, is going through the roof
the ecb is very, very likely to keep on increasing the interest rates the us
so like i said, it's very, very likely we keep on getting interest rate hikes
i imagine in the next month we're going to be in a confirmed recession
once again, if you do want to follow me over on twitter, it is here at 618 underscore cowboy
now, like i've been saying, uh, the markets are really, really not looking good today
i did talk about a couple of new price predictions over on my youtube channel
so if you do want my specific ta just for bitcoin, where we're not really focusing on the stock market, then go check out my previous video
like i said, this is where we talk about the stock market in correlation to bitcoin
i've already posted a bitcoin ta ops episode today, so if you want my full thoughts on that, go check it out
the squeeze mom which is our momentum indicators, are heading down
and when we are flipping to the downside, we are now below the heart line
we had a dead cat bounce and a fake out on the macd, and this was a fake out below the heart line
let's move over to the total, which is the total cryptocurrency market cap
now this is massively, massively lagging to the downside right now
you know, the best way to look at this is probably to head over to my brave browser, if we check out the total crypto market cap, just like we've been predicting for a while, we said that we were going to break below the 618
we said that we were going to come all the way down to the 300 week
we've only got about another 22 to the downside before we have hit this target on the head, it looks like
coming over to the daily time frame, we are currently capitulating below the 200 week moving average for the second time
so if you think that this is bloody, what we've seen right now, if you think that, you know, because we're dumping so hard today, uh, momentum must be subsiding, right? well, i think a lot of people thought that when we were capitulating below the 618 fibonacci, they were probably thinking, you know, this can't get too much more bloody
but the fact of the matter is, when you break below these major areas of support, like the 618 fib the 786 fib, which we aren't currently down to at this moment in time, i should say, but the 200 week is a massive, massive macro, uh, moving average
and the fact that we are capitulating below it today, the fact that we are forming another bear flag, the fact that we're in a red, green, red formation, heading down to hell, it really doesn't look good for the total crypto market cap, total 2 as well, is probably, yeah, this is really not looking good either
you've got a slightly more micro 786 fibonacci right here, which we are currently hugging at this moment in time
so you can imagine, old coins are definitely going to get decimated
if the stock market continues to head down, then we're very likely to see this continuation as well
uh, the dollar, we've been talking about this a lot in the past couple of weeks, but the dollar is on an absolute rampage right now
if we extrapolate this brat back, you can see we've formed a handle and a massive cup
we consolidated, consolidated, consolidated for like, a month or so
you know, people were saying, you know, the dollar's going down
we were simply forming a bullish handle for a cup and handle pattern
and where's the price target for this? in my opinion, it makes sense to draw our fibonaccis from our low to the high
so it looks like the dollar probably has about another six percent to move up to the upside
and bear in mind, the dxy is basically just how the dollar is measuring against other uh, against other fiat currencies
so you know, don't think necessarily that the dollar will be king forever, because the dollar is trash
it's just outperforming other fiat currencies at this moment in time
but subsequently, the dxy goes up, it just doesn't look good for the economy
sp why is massively heading down? the spx is massively heading down, if we look at a couple of other tech stocks as well
if you want my ta on bitcoin, i did make a separate video about that
i mean, take that with a grain of salt, because bitcoin's down six percent
google was down four percent, which should mean that bitcoin should probably be getting hit a lot harder than it currently is
all of these tech stocks, all of these, um, all of these stocks anyway, are just massively gapping to the downside
i mostly cover tech stocks anyway, because i think they've got a high correlation to the crypto markets, rather than looking at things like airbnb and whatnot
but nonetheless, looking at airbnb, this is down seven point five percent today
so you got massive, massive companies with a much higher market cap than, uh, bitcoin, and they are getting decimated
we look at the daily time frame for coinbase stock, it looks like we're about to have a bearish macd flip anytime soon
so it's really just not looking good for the markets right now
it looks like this was a mini head and shoulders breakdown, and this is looking like a big old m pattern
so once again, i would like to highlight, yes, the markets do seem exceptionally bloody right now
you know, a lot of people would very much like to believe the bottom is in, or has been in for, you know, a prolonged period of time
you've got things like google, tesla um, you know, netflix, apple, uh, the nasdaq, spy, spx, all of these, uh, stocks are completely getting decimated
uh, if you watch my previous bitcoin ta video, you you'll know why i'm targeting these levels
but 18 500, 16 500 and 14 000, technically, there is a target down here at 12 000
if you do want to know why, then be sure to go out, uh and check my previous bitcoin video
and it is an interesting pattern that is playing out at this moment in time
so as always, my friends, that is all i've got for this episode, bitcoin, the stock market blues
i hope this video gave you some insight in what to expect in the market next
all right, everyone, welcome back to the channel for another bitcoin update
i want to quick fire through a couple of charts and give you a quick couple of updates
in the last video we made for bitcoin, we were around about this range, 21 600 ish, pushing up to about 22 000
and we will, obviously, just like we've been calling this the entire way down
we've been calling for lower price targets, and they're finally starting to heavily, heavily come into fruition
i'm going to talk about a bunch of individual charts with a bunch of chart patterns
talk about a new chart pattern that i have not previously talked about before and then we'll be moving on to the oscillators and looking at how, in the short term, uh, the oscillators and momentum indicators are likely to affect the price
so right off the back, to clear up some of my charts, i want to tell you what my price targets are
my first price prediction that i've been saying for a very long time now, is all the way down here at the cme gap
this has been in place since the 7th of december 2020, we created a gap on the chicago mercantile exchanges futures
so i'm gonna remove, actually, i'm gonna, i'm gonna show you this price target over here
first, we have the 300 week moving average coming in at 16 700
and i do think, just like i've been saying for ages, it's much more likely to start expecting a bottoming structure around this range than it was to expect the muscling structure up in this range
i don't want to make this an elliott wave video, but simply, if you do draw most basic five wave structure, uh, without worrying too too much about the individual wave count between them, you can see, according to elliott wave theory, we should bottom above the one wave, which should mean we should bottom
if in terms of the weekly time frame, we should bottom between these ranges, because it can come down to the counter body close and still be valid
i've been saying for months now, 16 500 to 14 000 is my bottoming range, and i'm still sticking with my guns on that
so let's move on to the previous chart that we were running, and i'll talk about a new pattern that i have noticed in the market
so what you can see is drawing our fibonacci from our low to our high
we were basically talking about this massive bearish pendant to the downside
if you extrapolate it, we did this in the last video, it's going to be like 7 000 or 8 000
and once again, i absolutely do not believe bitcoin is going anywhere near those ranges
so i'm not even going to humor the price target at this moment in time
but what you can see is our fibonacci from our low to our high
this orange box is the most important range that you would need to hold if you wanted to remain bullish
and i have to emphasize that this is what the fibonaccis tell us
according to the fibonaccis, as long as we stay above the 786 fibonacci at 18 500, which lines up with our cme futures gap, then we would be bullish
and then if we do break to the downside of this chart, 14 979, basically call it 15 000
and this is subsequently going to allow us to come down another 21 to the downside
so, um, let's move on to this new person i have been noticing, and it is one of my favorite patterns
uh that i do notice playing out with a very high degree of certainty in the markets a lot of the time
if you haven't heard of this, uh, prediction before, it's basically where you extrapolate a trend
so from your a down to your b, you take the trend line of this, almost like a bear flag price target, but you extrapolate up to the c correctory wave, and then you come down to fill the d
and subsequently, this is called an a b equals c d because the length of a b is the same as c d
so if we extrapolate this, making sure that i've got the exact top target up here as to not uh, elongate this any further, you can see this is slightly more conservative than a bear flag, because this would actually be measured from the top up here, after you've had your abc
if you measured a bear flag breakdown, you'd be measuring from here
very similar stuff, but this would be yielding a price target down here at twelve thousand one hundred, uh? do i think that's in play? i mean, not really
i've been saying this for months now, sixteen thousand, five hundred to fourteen thousand is my bottoming range
i'm not going to change my prediction on that until we do break to the downside of that
does that mean i'm not preparing myself for the, uh, for the chance of a breakdown to the downside? absolutely not
i'm going very heavy in bitcoin between the ranges of 16 500 to 14 000, mainly because i've been sitting on the sidelines for months now while everyone's been buying the dip
and now i've got a good amount of capital to step in and buy the dip
but i would not want to not buy it fourteen thousand, see it come down to my fourteen thousand price target and then moon up to the upside
so that being said, sixteen thousand, uh, to sixteen thousand, five hundred to fourteen thousand, this is where i go very heavy
subsequently, if we do continue with this, you can see we would have originally had the fifty two percent drop
this would be about a seventy five percent drop to the downside to come
this would mean, from where we are, about another 36 percent, uh, percent drop
and honestly, with the way the economy is, the way the economy is right now, it doesn't really seem too farfetched
let's talk about sixteen thousand five hundred and fourteen five thousand five hundred
when the dollar took a correction, we told you, do not count the dollar out until it's broken below your weekly moving averages, until it breaks below your daily moving averages, until it has that major capitulation, is not out for the count
and it looks like it's getting ready to press to the upside and make a higher high
we also talked about this very, very beautiful pattern panning out for the dollar
it looks better when you draw the handle, uh, for the cup over on the daily time frame
and as you can see, we are in a very, very nice cup and handle pattern to the upside
do i think the price target of this is going to get here? absolutely not
do i think the price target of our 1618 fibonacci all the way up here? let me see if we go to the daily time frame, because we had between the ranges of 110 and 111, let's find the dollar
now, this is a lot more conservative than the price target of this cup and handle
but with that being said, you know, we were predicting this move up, and as you can see, we're already starting to move up very, very strongly
if the dollar moves up another six percent, what is this going to mean for the stock market? well, the nasdaq is very, very likely to continue its descent down to the 200 week moving ave, to the 300 week moving average
you can see in times of major capitulations like down here, this was the 2008 uh recession
we moved below all of your major moving averages after the recession was confirmed, and within the next, i believe it's 28 to 29 days now, uh, there is not an exact confirmed date on it yet, at least the last time i checked, which was about 24 hours ago
if that is negative, then i'm telling you, that is a confirmed recession
and we're probably going to get absolutely clarted to the downside
we're probably going to have a big, big move below these moving averages
so once again, i really do think it's conservative to expect the dollar and the stock market to subsequently or the dollar to take a leg up, stock market to take a leg down
now, we talked about the fact that bitcoin was long capitulating below the previous alltime high when you're accounting for the money supply
i'm not going to jump into this, uh, heavily in this video, because i made an entire video about it yesterday
let's see, if we go over to my educational or if we go over to my channel, you can see this video, bitcoin accounting for the money supply, we talked about it all over in there, but just a quick heads up, you know, we were talking about the fact that bitcoin was capitulating below its previous alltime high, you know, six weeks, eight months uh, two, not eight months ago, uh, six to eight weeks ago
and as you can see, uh, this is when you account for inflation, when you divide it by the m2 money supply, when you're looking at the real growth of bitcoin, because you're taking away inflation, we were long below the previous alltime high
so this was a very nice indicator to give us a heads up that, hey, potentially we might be adding down to these price targets as well
with that being said, let's move back over to our oscillators
we talked about how the dollar is likely to head up, the stock market is likely to head down
we talked about the macro market structure for bitcoin, and how, when accounting for the money supply, we were already long gone, and we're already pretty much down here at the 200 week moving average
let's wrap up the video and talk about the oscillators, because i would like to make a separate video for bitcoin later on in the evening and not cover everything right now
if you're a veteran to the channel, you know that i've been calling for this for months and months now, so seeing this finally start to massively head to the downside really shouldn't be too surprising for you if you are already a veteran to the channel
and subsequently, just like i've been saying, lower price targets are definitely in play for bitcoin
so let's start off on the higher time frames and work our way down
the squeeze one, which is my favorite momentum indicator, is still somewhat trending back to the heart line, which would be indicative that bears are losing control, slash balls are coming back into control
but bear in mind, on the higher time frames, it takes a large amount of momentum to switch this back over into a bearish stance
and when we do, just quickly peek at the four hourly, uh, squeezebomb, you will notice that we have already initiated that next link to the downside
so if bitcoin keeps on moving down, or even if bitcoin doesn't move down anymore today, and it just does what it's already done, the squeeze one is going to very, very quickly capitulate and head back down to the downside
looking at the money flow indicator, the money flow indicator has been heading up very, very strongly
but you will notice, if we do get topped out at this range, this will be a one top, double top, triple top, and we're very, very likely to see a move back down for the money flow indicator
looking at the macd, we are below the heart line, uh, balls rather, losing extreme amounts of strength right now
you can see, when the macd previously had a massive runup in october, we were all the way up here, you know, we broke down low or high, broke down low or high
and now it looks like the macd on the daily time frame, this is already starting to converge down
so we're probably going to see a bearish flip on this very, very soon
what's that going to mean? that's going to mean that, you know, you've basically come down and had a double bottom structure so far, but if you do make a lower high on the macd, then the only direction is down, my friends
and the macd is probably going to get decimated, uh, before we have a chance of reversing
as you can imagine, these are leading indicators of what is likely to bleed out into the daily time frame after you give it enough time
the squeeze bomb, like we already said, this reset some of its momentum in the past day, and now it is absolutely pushing very heavily down to the downside
the money flow indicator, while is going up on the daily time frame, this only updates every day
and if we look at the four hourly ema ribbons, not the ema ribbons, rather, the mfi, the money flow indicator, this is already starting to capitulate very, very harshly
on the daily you can see about a eight basis point decrease over on the mfi
and subsequently, this is probably going to be a leading indicator of the price of bitcoin continuing to drop, just like we've been talking about for hourly macd
all you see to the uh, to the upside is, you know, you've got these big swings up, balls completely losing control, and lower lows and lower highs all around
and then when you look at the bearish structure, you've got, you know, you've got lows, and then you come down, and you take a massive, massive leg to the upside
and when the balls do try and step back into the market structure, you will just notice that they did not manage to keep the trend running up
it's just another lower height for the balls and a lower low for the bears is indicative that we should be moving back down to the downside
on the squeeze on the on the macd, and the squeeze mom and the mfi
i hope today's video gave you some insight of what to expect next
once again, if you are a seasoned veteran to my channel, this should not be of any surprise for you
you should already know because we've been talking about this for the past couple of months
so once again, 16 500, technically five hundred is the cme gap
and if we are going to confirm the elliott wave theory held true, then we should bottom above this candle body close
which, if we move over to the actual price chart of bitcoin, we'll be here
so for example, over here on bitstamp, it was ten thousand seven hundred
so you do need to take it with a slight grain of salt when you are looking at charts like these
i'm not calling for anything below 14 000, but we do have a very, very nice and very valid a b equals cd pattern potentially taking us down all the way to 12 000
so that being said, that's all i've got for you today, my friends
[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so here bitcoin is after the drop yesterday, still sort of hovering sideways
so what we're gonna do in this video, we're gonna take a look at the updated elite wave count
we take a look at where it could be going now, based on the latest scenario changes we made on the elite wave count
um, [Music], as you probably know, if you've been watching my videos, you need to be aware that on these lower time frames, if we do elliott wave counting, these are very fragile
there are usually two to three scenarios that can unfold that are very likely
i mean, if you do this on a five minute time frame, you know, you're just changing all the time, because you are investigating a case, you know, that will then give you an idea of where the price will move next with a very high probability
again, the elite wave method is probably the best method for this
and the higher the time frame, the less or the, yeah, the less you have to change your scenarios
um, because usually waves don't get invade invalidated that easily
but on the shorter time frame, especially if you're in a sideways range
and when you move from one to the other one, what you do? you just have to change your scenario
that doesn't have that doesn't mean that the elliott wave method doesn't work, because i always get the comments, just when we change the wave count, that the elliott wave method doesn't work
you are basically here what we're doing, we're investigating the case for a bullish scenario
um, and the more of these bullish scenario wave counts we can rule out, the less likely it will be
for me, there's currently only one bullish wave count left, and this is the one that we have on the chart
and if that gets invalidated, then, of course, we are not in a bullish environment or bullish scenario anymore
yeah, so this doesn't have anything to do that the method doesn't work
it is the same as and i don't know why, you know, a lot of people don't seem to understand this, but if you do technical analysis without um elite waves, for example, yeah
you speculate, for example, for a certain trend line to be held, yeah, that so
or for example, that the price finds support on a certain line
now if that's, if that line gets broken, do you really say, ta, doesn't work
you usually have a plan when you do trading for the bullish outcome and the bearish outcome
or if the one that doesn't work, that you did not expect works out, then you're not doing anything
no, you have to, of course, change wave counts if the price moves differently than expected, or it moves into your alternative scenario
and at the moment, we're not doing anything that we didn't have on the radar
at the moment, we're coming down a little bit too much for the more bullish scenario i had on the chart
and that means all we do is we go, we fall back into our higher level wave count
we fall back into our, uh, alternative scenario, even though, strictly speaking, the other one where we had a one two wave and another one two, hasn't even been invalidated
and therefore i'm showing you now the um, the one where we have to expect a larger retracement for this wave two
but someone asked me, um, if i could show just again, because i took it out, if i should, if i could just show again the labeling of this wave one here in detail, because i'm always saying, this is looking impulsive, but that person couldn't really see that impulse
well, it is a very clear impulse, um, this one, otherwise i wouldn't have mentioned it
so this here, yeah, is a wave one, we could say, and this one a wave two
then what we see here are just subwaves, and i can count them as well in a minute
and there are a couple of ways of counting this really, but this is one way
we're not cutting, we're not even cutting into line one territory
um, here again, one two, and this is one two, three, four, five
also here, you can count this as a diagonal if you want to, or you just go into the subway, so we can take a look at that as well
um, if we go to the lower level wave count, we now see how this all comes together, because then we can count the subway, for example, here, of the wave three as well
so if we do that, then we can count, and let me just pick the other one here
and you can argue if this was the wave three top, or this was the wave three top, doesn't really make a difference
and here we would need to go into the, again, the lower level wave count
but again, then we're going down into into real um micro counting
but even if you start here, you've got your one, two, three, four, five
so these are all impulsive waves that are coming there to the upside and that are being corrected um accordingly
so this is absolutely possible to count all of this as an impulse to the upside
and this is now, for me, the most likely scenario, that we moved up in a wave one here, and that we are now in this wave too
we never reached, but bear in mind, we never, or remember, we never reached this yellow target area for the wave 2 that i had formulated
yeah, that could have been, as i said back here, this could have been very bullish, because we did not retrace to the area that would normally expect a wave 2 to retrace to
and for that, i have to take this out, i would have to again recount this
that is actually correct, um, because that's an a, b, c as well
and we can also take a look at the current elliott wave count for the wave c
and, um, this suggests we actually very early in this wave c on this move down here
so that's something we need to be aware of, um, because the way we can count this move down is now that we count this here as a wave one, this here, then as a wave two, that retraced quite a lot
and again, there's a diagonal pattern, so no issues with overlapping waves here
and then this here, the way it currently seems, is a wave two
okay? so that would land somewhere here, then the wave 2 in purple, and so on
now, this could go, yeah, in my opinion, all the way down to 18 370
so we can look at that from a retracement point of view, looking at the wave one high and the wave two retracement, ranging here between the fifty percent fib retracement at sixteen, at 19 630, all the way down to the seventy eight point six percent flip level at eighteen thousand four hundred twenty six
one key support will be the nineteen thousand one hundred dollar level, which is this, sixty one point eight percent flip level
so this is the bullish wave count, where we had a wave one and the wave two down here now
and then if this is that wave count, then we would need to expect, this would, of course, be the three here, then we would expect somewhere here in the yellow target area, the price to turn around after three, four, five is finished, and finally start to move up
one more comment, yeah, one more comment is, i've always said, i've always said, all we're doing here is exploring a breakout to the upside
we have not yet broken this key resistance, which is important for confirming such a bullish scenario
any impulse below here can very easily just be a corrective wave
and we looked at that as well here on this bearish wave count, where we can easily say this here, down here, on the 18th of june, was just a wave three
as we reached the 236 fip level at 21k, this wave 4 could even go higher to the 23k level
that is what we would have to expect, reasonably anyway, 23k, because this is the most likely scenario for a way for and if we go down straight away from here, then we would have to go, first of all, below that previous swing low
that would be a good indication, nineteen thousand seven hundred dollars
but as you can see on the bullish count, um, it was even part of that scenario to move a little bit lower
so i wouldn't necessarily count this as confirmation the bearish wave count is working out
in fact, we have to expect that there is not a lot of clarity really, which scenario is working out, until we go below the low of um, the here, the um 18th of june on at 17 500 dollars
but as you can see, in both scenarios, short term, we would expect lower prices
so in this scenario, even because we haven't yet reached the yellow target area, which is all based on fibonacci retracements
and in the other one, probably, anyway, even though here, yeah
and that is what it makes it difficult at the moment, generally, in the environment, even here, we haven't reached the ideal target area
but we have to be also, in the bearish scenario, on high alert that the market could be rolling over, as we already reached 21k, the minimum retracement for a wave four
so therefore, and that is just what it is, in early trends to the upside, yeah
because if this is a trend change already to the upside, it is very early, and it's just very uncertain
and therefore, at the moment um, we have to expect both scenarios, bullish and bearish, with a high likelihood, especially as we are still below this red resistance area
and that is what i've always mentioned nearly in every video, that this is so important to overcome to make the bullish scenario the primary one

[Music], hello and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so bitcoin is, um, yeah, today we had pretty much sideways movement
um, what could be developing here could become a head and shoulders pattern, absolutely
this could, of course, become a head and shoulders pattern in a bearish version
and then the neckline would be here, around the current price range, maybe even a little bit lower
um, we have obviously come today here to the low of around nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars, pretty much a little bit lower
um, pretty much nineteen thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars we came down to
so there's, um, as always, multiple options that we how this could unfold here
um, but for me at the moment, given how the price section is currently unfolding, yeah, i would expect lower prices still
first of all, into this yellow target range, which is located between eighteen point four and nineteen 196 k
that is based on the assumption that we came up in an impulsive wave 1, and we are now moving down in an impul in a corrective wave 2, in an abc pattern, assuming wave c isn't finished yet
and we can calculate targets for this wave 2 various ways of how we can calculate targets here, but the most simple way is that we just take here the fibonacci retracement of the wave one, and we can get into this target area here, between the seventy eight point six percent fib level and the fifty percent flip level
that is just a very likely scenario for wave 2 here in purple
now, we can count nearly five waves as complete in this yellow wave three so in the wave two here, yeah, we obviously have a wave a already complete, a wave b already complete, and we are in this c wave
the c wave will have five waves here in yellow, one, two, three, there will be a four, and there will be a five
to understand if wave three is already finished, we can look at the wave count here, and it looks to me like that this here was a one, two
again, oftentimes the longest wave we could have had, a very short wave four here
again, it's a bit difficult, you know, we're looking here already on the one hour time frame, so this is really getting into micro counting
i'm making making assumptions, right? so it could very well be here, this was already wave four, five
wave 4 is now coming, and then there will be another wave 5 down um or wave 3 hasn't finished yet, and that would still be happening
there will be a bit of a retracement to the upside, possibly a little bit more in a way, four um, possibly
that way, five down should break this 19 826 level, and it should take us here into this yellow target area that we talked about
and is there another way to calculate target? well, we can also calculate target based on the length of the wave a
take the length of the wave a, add it to the high of the wave b
and one very likely target here would be the one point six one eight extension, which is at eighteen thousand six hundred seventy dollars
but in this wave count, i would still expect lower prices either way, possibly all the way all the way down to, in the probably my initial worst case here in this scenario, eighteen thousand four hundred dollars
there is also a bearish scenario that i also want to show you here, so we don't forget about it
that would assume that the price action that has come up here from the low was only corrective in nature
that fifth wave down can, in my worst case, go down all the way to 106 k
when would this downward move get very likely? well, to be fair, um, there is not much there that can confirm its likelihood
i mean, it might get a bit more likely below 19750, but this would still be covered by the bullish scenario, to be honest
i'm only saying this might make it a bit more likely, because this is important swing low here that you can see
if we go below that, it might make it a bit more likely that we actually go down
so this is sort of the the bearish, um, [Music] bearish version here
um, is there another bearish alternative? thought a little bit about it
yes, there is also another bearish alternative that would, um, assume, if i go back to the daily chart, that would be, um, an even more bearish alternative here, possibly, where we would assume that this year this high was actually a wave three
this here was a wave four, and this up here was, in fact, a wave five
i'm not a real friend of that, because this way, four retraced a bit too much
and also, i have personally difficulties to count this as an impulse
and then that we came down here in a wxy pattern, so that we take that out, take the fibs out, just to show you that
and we came down here in a w x y and one target for the y wave is, for example, uh, the one to one ratio of the wave w let's actually say, i haven't checked that before
let's see if that is a target that would make sense, because they always need to make sense
and yes, in this scenario, the y wave, yeah, could very well come to twelve thousand three hundred dollars
that is, um, an absolute viable and possible target here for the wave y
um, if this is just another possibility, and we would then here, how would the y wave be made up? yeah, um, this would mean, and this would actually be also in line, sort of with my expectations, because i told you that i do expect a rally
yeah, could just be a five wave move a wave a to the low 17500
wave a, we would come up in a wave b, which is a corrective move up
and that could definitely go to the 12 000 level of something
so this is definitely a scenario we need to have on the radar as a bearish scenario
that would not invalidate my current view that we might be in an impulsive breakout to the upside
because on the lower time frames this might look like an impulse
in fact, what might be emerging here is just the wave b to the upside um
so we won't really know which kind of rally is emerging until we see further evidence in the structure
um, it might be a an impulsive one, which will really then lead to sustainable overtime heights
but that it will lead to a sustainable alltime highs is in no way guaranteed
and we could even say that this wave b, i mean, that might move up all the way to, in an extreme case, i would say, even 45 000, you know
and that's just as a message to anyone who says, um, we cannot get a rally because there is just no money in there
but even if you're heading into a recession, we can have corrective rallies to the upside if we're totally oversold
this is definitely a scenario that could work out that would also be very much in line with the five wave move down that we had
yeah, um, in my, uh, my chart that i normally use, um, because we had five waves, wave, five wave
now we now need to wait if what is coming up here will be a five wave move or a three wave move
if it's a three wave move, it will be that wave b, and we will come down once more, lower
at the moment, there is just these charts at the moment represents just a lot of uncertainty
and i understand this is frustrating for everybody, but we need to appear
we've just come out of a, um, out of seven months where the scenario was very clear
i know it might not have been very clear to everybody, but my view was always very clear that we have to go below 286 k
so from my point of view, in the last seven months, since november, really or since end of november, the scenario was very clear
yeah, of course, in the lower time frames it sometimes gets a bit messy, but the overall scenario here was very, very clear
yeah, we are here in a little bit of an uncertain state where we just need to see now how the structure is evolving
i understand everybody wants to know, but we need to be patient
and patience is a very, very important um characteristic that everybody should have in the crypto market

in this video, we're taking a look at the bitcoin price on the two hourly, looking at this major support level
on yesterday's live stream, we absolutely crushed this shorting opportunity
this was mentioned yesterday on the live stream, looking for that short range at the 211k level, and absolutely crushing it here, meeting the target
we were looking also at this inverted adam and eve scenario to be completed when we were trading at these levels
now your question might be, what is going to happen? are we going to break the support level and retest the lows here from june, or are we going to get a big, massive bounce? i'm going to talk about the big, major support levels
we're also taking a look at ethereum, because ethereum also played out beautifully here, having this breakout from this ascending wedge and coming all the way here to our target here that we mentioned for a trade on the telegram for the bitcoin sensors team
and also, we are going to take a look here at ethereum, because we are hitting big, major support levels right now
is the price going to go up? is the price going to go down? i don't know
but what i do know is some big, major levels where we can take some opportunities
let's dive in guys here, straight into the video, because we had some pretty nice momentum yesterday
a lot of people were in doubt from this major resistance level, where we did take a short opportunity, okay, here for the competition for the bitcoin census team at this range over here, the 21 212 was that level, to wait for this beautiful consolidation
and then we had the confirmation, okay, to actually continue here to the downside, playing out beautifully
we know that the descending channels usually break to the upside, but we were very much confident here to complete this double top, inverted adam and eve scenario right over here, to come down and retest this low 20 000 range
now, your question, what is going on now? what? i don't care what happened yesterday
what's going to happen next? well, let's dive in here straight to see what could happen here right away
because what is happening is that we are getting a reaction from this resistance here of this descending neckline, as you can see, currently getting a small reaction at this level
it is very soon to know if we need to actually buy the market here, because, you know, we are still very much falling
if we had a major consolidation, then this would make me pretty bullish
why would it make me bullish? well, let me just make you understand here that this has been a major support range, okay, here, during the month of june
and it is also the value area low of as you can see here on the volume profile from the last volume traded, the 15 days, okay, last 15 days traded
but it is true that we are retesting this level, okay, for the third, fourth time, as you can see, once we came above it, and also creating this double top scenario, very dangerous scenario over here
now, i do expect a little bit of volatility, potentially coming lower
and your question might be, how low? well, i want to show you here fib levels from this low to the high, right over here
we did get a consolidation at the 382, all right, around about this range, at the 20 200, okay? as you can see here on the chart, many hourly candles trading at the 382 level
so now we have, we are below this range, getting some support at this level at this moment, getting that consolidation
i will be very much more interested in actually longing this range
i do not think that the price of bitcoin will have a successful breakout below 19 000
i do think that in between 20 000 and 19 000 is a very good range where we could consolidate and look for that potential big bounce
your question, why? because we do have a very strong resistance
okay, just to remind you that this 194k levels has been very strong resistance here once we broke below this range, okay? you can see several bounces as resistance and support
remember, back in december, in late november of 2020, we had a very large consolidation here of over a week, okay, even two weeks at this range
so if we just zoom in here again, all right, on the btc price on the one hourly we can see that this level has been very much respected as resistance, not much as support
but we are not interested here at we're getting into this bounce if we do not get a consolidation above the daily level, we broke straight through it
so what we saw here was big, major resistance at this daily level
and if i take a look at fibonacci levels, this is around about the 50 level also
okay? as you can see in between the 618, which is up 192, and 50, which is at the 197, is where we do have the daily level
and big, big resistance here that we'll be turning into support
so if we start falling from this price, a lot of the people, most of the people, are going to be bearish, because we have broken support
and it is very likely that we're going to come down to retest here below 18 000
and i do think that there is a big possibility that if we do dip below the 18 000, the 19 000, sorry, 800 range, okay, and do not make it with a lot of volume and start consolidating
okay, the most important thing here is checking out the volume from this breakout
it is true that it is very likely that we are going to see some kind of a spike in volume if it does break down
but if we break down with low volume and start making sideways action on the price, okay, this is going to be extremely bullish
we are only five six hundred dollar, okay? from we only about five six hundred dollars away from that level
currently trading at twenty thousand fifty dollars while i'm doing this video
so if we get that drop, all depending, guys, all depending, i am looking very much bullish at this range, okay, if we are going to dip below, but only if we have low volume, and only if we do consolidate in the next coming hours, if we have that breakdown, because a lot of people are going to be bearish at this level, guys, just like a lot of, uh, people might have been bearish at this range
okay? looking for bitcoin to have continuation to the downside
if we do dip down below the nineteen thousand eight hundred dollar range, looking for those long opportunities
if we do get that consolidation, very important, because we can have a falling knife, and a lot of people are gonna rush into a trade
and i will not rush into a trade unless we have several consolidation candlesticks here and multiple attempts to break below here, this 19 200 range, and fail, this is where i'm going to be extremely, extremely bullish, guys
now, what if bitcoin does get a bounce, okay, to the upside from this range? well, of course, i will only be bullish, okay? only be looking for higher levels if we do manage to break above this descending channel
i think there is another major shorting opportunity here on a bitcoin if we do come back up and retest here, the 20 500 range
it is the biggest point of control from the volume traded the last 15 days
and we also have, okay, this major support range with a lot of wicks that will be very likely turning into resistance, potentially for another leg down here, at least to retest the lows here that we have created of 19 900
if we do start pumping heavily, i think that we are very likely going to get at least one rejection
but we need to stay cautious on the second leg down to see how we are going to react, because we might be creating a double bottom
so we need to go level to level, guys, all depending if you want to day trade, you want a swing trade
but these are big, major levels where i do think that we can take opportunities right over here, also, from this major drop, if we do take a look at fibonacci levels, okay, from this high over here to this low, around about that 50 eight would be in between, you know, the twenty thousand five hundred and twenty thousand six hundred dollar range, where i do think the price, you know, we got fib levels, we got the resistance from the tr from this descending channel, and the biggest point of control
and potentially we will be looking for a double bottom to see if these lows are going to hold
remember, the value area low from this trading range, this is extreme, extreme support, just like the value area high from this range is extreme, extreme resistance price action
didn't manage to get above this range at the 21 500 successfully
it's an upcoming platform that has been here for quite some time, right now, gaining in volume and popularity

they do support over 100 000 trades per second, so you don't have to worry about the overload
there are some platforms, and also big platforms out there that they do have big, massive wicks some places on the chart
and this does not happen with magix, which is super, super important, guys
this short also, it was a perfect, perfect call, because we had an entry point, you know, between 1219 and 1236, and we actually consolidated at that level, giving us time to get into that shorting opportunity
remember, guys, you know the ascending wedge here, beautiful, beautiful ascending wedge right there, breaking down and actually getting rejected from the biggest point of control that we did have here at the 1220 range
also hitting the 618 level, okay? if you just start adding up, you know, fibonacci levels and, you know, adding confluence
this was an absolutely beautiful, beautiful trade, short position with a lot of, lot of confluence, which is giving you that high probability leg to the downside
so now, this happened already, but just a quick overview of what we were talking about yesterday
we need to know what has happened yesterday to what could, what could happen today and potentially tomorrow
there is a very, very strong daily level here on ethereum right now where we have got a perfect bounce almost to the exact dollar
this was a take profit range, okay? mentioned on the team, okay, for the competition, the bitcoin census team
now, let me just zoom out here, just to remind you here, why is this a daily level? if we do zoom out right over here, back in january of 2021, we do have some major daily levels right over here, as you can see, as support
and this has been a nice level that we have bounced from, all right, just a couple of hours ago
so coming back here to ethereum, zooming in, right? we've got that daily level
not only it is a daily level, we do have this evaluary high on the vpvr
we've got a validary high value area low, as you can see on the vpvr, big spike, the one that we got rejected from
this is currently this valuary high where we are getting supported, you can see on the price action
you know what other confluence can we add here to the chart? just keep it simple
if we take a look at fibonacci levels, from this low to the high level, we are bouncing exactly at that
the possibilities on ethereum, getting a bounce from here, is very, very possible
the potential, uh, target is coming all the way down here to the ascending uh from from the ascending wedge low
we have very, very strong support on on bitcoin, so i'm not sure if ethereum will go that low to the 900 in the next coming days
and we can see that ethereum might be getting a bounce from this level now
as you can see here on the chart, we are getting that reaction at the 382
so there is a possibility a shortterm bounce could happen here on ethereum
but if we do break down this major support level, our next major target where we could get a potential bounce, guys, is right over here at the one thousand, one thousand and forty dollar range
of course, once you retest it a few times, it is possible that it's going to get broken
we've got a small reaction here at this level, but once we got above this range, you can see that beautiful bounce at that daily level again
okay? if ethereum price does come down to this level, all right, in the next coming hours, couple of days, it is also the value area low after this range, okay? you can see the spike starts from here, okay, from that 1040 range
so if it did manage to break down, it is very likely that this is going to be reached
because, you know, there is no volume, as you can see from the last 15 days, traded at this range
so if we do have a solid breakout, and i mean a solid breakout, with a nice one hourly, even four hourly candle close well below the 1040 range, if it does retrace back up, this is gonna be an insane, insane resistance level, you will have time to potentially enter a trade here quickly for continuation to the downside
this value area low will also be big, big resistance if you manage to close below that range, okay, the 1040 range
so these are the kind of levels that we are looking for here on ethereum
what if the price of ethereum does get a bounce from this range? well, of course, we would be looking for some major, major resistance levels
looking at the immediate short term, we can see that this, this level, this area, okay, is super, super strong support
okay, we had a kind of head and shoulder scenario right there
we got a nice, nice, solid resistance zone here at the 1180, 1170, okay, plus minus that 10
and we're also looking at fib levels here from this high to the low range area
maybe if you do get that price action to the upside and have a consolidation, this is going to tell you that the price action of the balls is getting exhausted
you need to wait for that reaction and decide if you're going to trade it
if you were to take a look also at this level here, these lower lows, we are actually getting a reaction
we are dipping slightly below, you know, this trend line slightly at this level, managing to get a support
if you do get that balance, we do have a lot of resistance here, like i said, for that potential come back down to retest the lows
the price action of a lot of assets like to do double bottoms, or even triple bottoms, or double tops, okay, or triple tops, before actually, you know, having a trend direction
so if we do get that correction right now, that bounce to the upside, it is very likely going to be retested at least once to see if we are going to get that, you know, bigger bounce to the upside
i will be extremely active, of course, for the competition team

my name is josh, and this chart right here shows us billions of dollars that has entered into bitcoin, alongside michael saylor, who has just bought another 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin today for micro strategy
so i'll be talking about that in just a moment, alongside the shortterm bitcoin charts, shortterm ethereum chance and the pullback we're now seeing for ethereum vs bitcoin, and what that means for the old queen market
so definitely stick around to the end of the video so that you don't miss out on any of this important information
first of all, just giving you a quick update on the weekly bitcoin charts, looking at the pi cycle bottom indicator, these two moving averages are extremely close to crossing over, but they haven't crossed over just yet
which means, technically speaking, we could still have a little while longer before we reach any sort of bear mark at bottom, according to bitcoin's entire price history
because obviously, if you're looking at the previous two significant bitcoin bear markets, which were back in 2014 and 2018, at the end of those bear markets, we saw this bottom signal in this supply cycle bottom indicator, where basically the red moving average crosses underneath the green moving average
and the moments that happened in 2014, the very next week we saw the bear market bottom
and then the moment that happened at the end of the 2018 bear markets, we saw the bottom for that bear market in the exact same week as these lines crossing over
and once again, they're getting very close, but they haven't crossed over just yet
and while we're here, obviously the weekly bitcoin rsi is still in oversold territories, which has only happened just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history, which both turned out to be bear market bottoms
and so now giving you a quick update on the bitcoin long positions on the bifinix exchange on the weekly time frame
and nothing much has happened over the past one to two weeks, which is why i haven't really been updating on this chart over the past week or so
but in case you might be new to the channel, these long positions on this exchange are sitting at an alltime high, which means right now, these long positions on this exchange are holding more bitcoin than ever before
in fact, right now there's around 107 500 bitcoin in these bitcoin long positions, which is equivalent to well over 2 billion us
and in case there's any beginners out there, a long position is essentially betting on the bitcoin price going up
so there's over two billion dollars, a record amount of bitcoin on this exchange, betting on the bitcoin price going back up
but other than that, there's nothing much else to add here that i haven't already said over the past one to two weeks
and right now we're still seeing that short term pullback, with the rsi and the macd also pulling back, but for the most part, on this 12 hour bitcoin chart
we're still experiencing a lot of choppy sideways price action, just shortterm bullish and bearish price action, but overall, sideways
and obviously, as i've been saying over the past one to two weeks, this time period in the market is extremely similar to what we've seen roughly around one month ago
and considering the fact that we've been seeing a lot of choppy sideways price ranges within this bear market so far, and we're likely going to continue to see more choppy sideways price ranges
so because of that, i'm thinking of making a different type of video tomorrow, separate from my regular analysis videos
and in that separate video, i might share a simple, yet profitable trading strategy during choppy sideways price action
so let me know in the comment section down below if you're interested in seeing a video like that
and right now, as of recording this video, the bitcoin price has been finding some shortterm support around this previous low that we saw a few days ago, which is sitting at just underneath 20 000 per bitcoin
and obviously, this is something that i've been talking about for the past few days
ever since we really initially broke that level right there for this rising wedge pattern, one of the main levels of support for bitcoin, at least in the short term, is at around 20 000, or in fact, just below 20 000, more specifically, at around 197 to 198 k
but if we fall below this previous low, obviously, that would not be a good sign, because it'll show that we're actually putting in another lower low on the short term time frames
and in that case, i would immediately look towards this golden pocket in the fibonacci retracement tour, which is coming into play at around 19 000
if we break below that previous low at around 197 k, i would expect a drop down towards around 19 000
and anything below that golden pocket, we do have the technical price target for this rising wedge pattern, which is towards the bottom of the wedge
so basically revisiting that original low down towards around 17 and a half to eighteen thousand dollars per bitcoin
so to summarize the fourhour bitcoin charts, right now, technically speaking, we're looking slightly more bearish than bullish, but we are running into a level of support where we could see a bounce from
but as of right now, we still yet to see the shortterm rsi on this fourhour time frame, and the shortterm macd actually reversed back into bullish momentum
we are still seeing shortterm bearish momentum on this fourhour time frame
but in the bitcoin news today, we have michael saylor by another 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin, more specifically 480 bitcoin, for his company, micro strategy
and so now this purchase, relative to some of their other purchases, is actually a relatively small purchase for micro strategy
but what it shows us is michael sailor is still 100 convinced on bitcoin as a longterm investment, despite being over a billion dollars underwater as of right now
because right now, microstrategy's break even price is sitting at around 306 k
which means if the bitcoin price is below that price, just there, obviously they're sitting in an unrealized loss, unless they actually sell bitcoin, then they would realize a loss
and over the past few months, if you've been following crypto and especially crypto twitter, you probably heard some news stories or some rumors come out about michael sailor and micro strategy getting liquidated when bitcoin drops to 21 000
but obviously all of those news articles and rumors were completely false
we're still seeing michael taylor buy bitcoin at around 20 000
and who knows, if it keeps dropping, they might end up buying even more
and as michael saylor said himself a while ago, actually, it isn't until bitcoin hits around three thousand dollars per coin that he actually has to post more collateral for the debt that he has against his bitcoin
so unless you think the bitcoin price is going to dump below three thousand dollars per coin anytime soon, i don't see michael saylor getting liquidated anytime soon
but on a real note, can michael sayler hold off the bitcoin buys for a moment? because usually when he buys the bitcoin price basically dumps
and we're still finding support around this 382 fibonacci level
when you draw the fibonacci retracement tool from the march 2020 bottom to the alltime high
and this fibonacci level is coming into play at around 1050, 1050, and zooming into the 12hour ethereum to your solar chart, we're still seeing a very similar thing to what we saw yesterday, and also what we're seeing on the bitcoin 12 hour charts, which is basically a lot of choppy, sideways price action overall on the 12 hour time frame
but in the shorter term, we're seeing a bit more of a pullback to balance out that bullish price action that we previously experienced over the past one week or so
and right now, if you're simply just going off the price action the rsi and the macd on the 12 hour time frame, we do look like we're in a very similar situation in the short term to what we're in back here towards the end of may, after we experienced a lot of choppy, sideways press action, we experienced a bit more of a pullback, where the 12hour ethereum rsi also pulled back from its uptrend, and we did actually see a small bearish cross in the 12hour ethereum macd
and right now we're experiencing that shortterm pullback in the 12hour rsi, but we have not seen that bearish cost for the 12hour ethereum macd, at least just yet
now zooming in even further into the fourhour ethereum chance
what we're seeing at the moment, as i'm recording this video, is ethereum is finding some support around this 382 fibonacci level when drawn from the low that we saw a little over a week ago to this recent high
and this 382 fibonacci level is coming to play at around 11 k
but if ethereum confirms a break below 11 k, i'll be looking towards this previous low, which is sitting at around 1050, which is, once again, where that 382 fibonacci level is coming to play on the weekly time frame, but heading back to the four hour time frame
and anything below that previous low at around 1050, next i'll be looking towards 1 000 as a significant level of support, according to this golden pocket, and also one of the price targets for this rising wedge pattern, as i talked about more yesterday
but generally speaking, the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern is more often than not at the bottom of the wedge, which is coming into play at around 900 per ethereum
but keep in mind, between that price target and right now, we still have all of those other levels of support where we could see a bounce from those levels
and i talked more about how i incorporate that in a shortterm strategy in yesterday's video
so once again, if you missed my last video, definitely check it out, because that would be important to pay attention to
and something else that is important to pay attention to for not just ethereum holders, but all alt coin holders out there, and that is the ethereum versus bitcoin chart on this four hour time frame, which is experiencing that short term pullback today, which is exactly what i talked about yesterday
because not only were we showing bearish signs in both the rsi and the macd on the four hour time frame for ethereum versus bitcoin, before this pullback started, we were also seeing very clear wyck off distribution, as i also covered in my last video
and this right here, the wyckoff distribution schematic number two, is obviously a bearish pattern
you can see that the price moves up, and then we basically have that distribution, and then the price reverses into a downtrend
and right now we're basically in phase e of this wyk off distribution where we're seeing that downtrend to kick in, at least in the short term
but if you zoom out to the weekly time frame for ethereum vs bitcoin, that short term pullback is resulting in this weekly candle being a red candle
and this is happening right after we saw two green weekly candles for ethereum versus bitcoin, which also happens at the same time as the weekly ethereum versus bitcoin rsi brushed against oversold territories
and if you're comparing all of this to what we saw back in the 2018 bear markets, we could potentially be in a situation kind of like right here
and this area of circle is in september 2018, so it was in the second half of the bear market
but basically what we saw leading up to that stage, entering into 2018, we saw a significant drop off to the downside, followed by a fairly significant move back to the upside, but not higher than that previous high
and then we saw an even bigger move to the downside, where the rsi got down towards oversold territories
and then what came next after those two green weeks was a further pull back to the downside for ethereum versus bitcoin
and then we actually experienced a decent bounce back to the upside before another significant lake to the downside, which actually came after the bear market ended
so if you're comparing that to what we're seeing at the moment, we saw that significant move to the downside followed by a fairly significant bounce back to the upside, but not higher than that previous high
so this right here is somewhat similar to what we saw in early 2018
and then we saw the rsi reached down towards open source territories, just like here
then we saw two weeks of green, and now we're entering into another red week, very similar to what we saw back here
now obviously, just because we saw something play out in the past, it does not guarantee we're going to see the exact same thing in the future
but oftentimes we do see very similar things in markets due to human psychology trading the same things
so even though we might not end up seeing the exact same thing
and so overall, i am simply more bearish than bullish for a theorem versus bitcoin on this weekly chart as well as the current four hour time frame
which means if ethereum is pulling back against bitcoin, that essentially means ethereum is underperforming against bitcoin
and usually that is a pretty good indication for the overall altcoin market, especially on the larger time frames
alt coins did extremely well during this time period in the market during the more bullish times when ethereum was outperforming bitcoin
but in the more bearish times, alt coins and ethereum usually underperform against bitcoin, generally speaking
but there are still ways to make a lot of money with bitcoin, ethereum and old coins, even if the price is going down
and if you want to know exactly how to do that, check out this video popping up right here on your screen to find out how you can keep making money in crypto even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so in this episode, i'm going to be talking about bitcoin and it's correlation to the money supply
namely, we're going to be looking at the btc usd pair, and we're going to be dividing it by the m2 money supply
why would we do this? well, simply, the m2 money supply is a great measure of the money in the us
and subsequently, when we divide the price of bitcoin by the m2 money supply, it gives us a better interpretation of bitcoins real growth
now, i have just made a video about the money supply, talking about what is the money supply, and more depth, what is the m0, m1, m2, m3
so if you do want to learn more about the money supply before you do jump into this video, i will leave the link for that down below
that will definitely provide you some useful context if you're not already familiar with the money supply
so let's remove all of the drawings on these charts that we've got, and let's jump right into this
now, i'm namely going to be looking at bitcoins growth from its previous alltime high in 2017, december 2017, namely
and we're also going to be looking at its growth from the 1st of march 2020, which was the pandemic bottom
why am i looking at the growth from these regions? because i want to be talking about how the money supply of the m2 has affected bitcoin's growth from its previous alltime high up to its new alltime high
and i want to be talking about its growth from the pandemic scare all the way down here in march 2020, because that is when the money printer really started to get gearing up in the us
you can see, we look at march of 2020 over on the fred m2 money supply, you can basically see where this line in the sand is
there was a massive, massive increase in the money supply due to the pandemic
and subsequently, when we do look at bitcoin usd divided by the m2 money supply, it tells a very different story than btc usd
so first of all, let's look at bitcoins growth from cycle top to cycle top in 2018 to the current alltime high, all the way out here in the 1st of november
so what you will notice is the growth from bitcoin's previous alltime high in 2017, all the way up to 2021, we had a 242 increase from cycle high to cycle high
a lot less than people were expecting, but nonetheless very impressive
now, when we divide btc usd by the m2 money supply, once again, another way of saying this is we are accounting for inflation
when we do look at the growth from cycle top to cycle top, what do you think is going to happen when we account for inflation? well, when we do account for inflation, you will see that bitcoin has only moved up 120 approximately
so why does this make sense? well, it makes sense because if you've got x amount of money in the economy, and you double the money supply, as you can imagine, there's only a certain amount of goods in that economy
and namely, there is only ever going to be 21 million bitcoin in the economy
so subsequently, if you double the money supply, it's very likely the price of energy, food, houses, bitcoin and commodities, the stock market, everything will go up
and this is why we can see that when we're looking at real increases
so this is a concept in economics, real prices, real wages, real terms
so briefly talking about real terms, real percent increases, imagine it like this, let's say you get paid a thousand dollars at work a month, and then they double the money supply
so as you can imagine, if they double the money supply, let's say, hypothetically, in a closed economy, the price of the houses double, the prices of food doubles, your phone bill doubles, everything doubles
so what does your work do? they give you a 90 percent increase in your wages
so with that being said, you would have had 1 000, and because they've given you a 90 percent increase, you would now be getting paid 1 900
and let's say the original basket of goods that you buy every month, just to make things super simple, is one thousand dollars
as you can imagine, as the economy, or as the money supply has doubled, what this is going to mean is that the same basket of goods, your phone bill, your your um, your rent, your house, all of this stuff is going to double in price
so you know, what does this mean for the same basket of goods that you can buy? well, let's picture it this way, if you're able to buy one bask of goods for one thousand dollars, and they increase the money supply by double, so that same basket cost two thousand, but your wages are only one thousand nine hundred
what is this gonna mean? you've got a one thousand dollar increase in terms of the same basket of goods, but you're only getting 900 extra in terms of relief
and this would mean that your real wages would be down by a hundred dollars
so when we are accounting for bitcoin's growth, looking at the when dividing it by the m2 money supply, you can see, accounting for inflation, bitcoin has only moved up 127 percent in real terms, compared to 240, uh, 42 percent
that is very, very good, uh, at least compared to the stock market and other asset classes
so, as we can see by looking at the m2 money supply, as you can imagine, the growth of the dollar, or the supply of the dollar, should i say, has been drastically increasing since its inception
and subsequently, it's basically been on a long parabolic growth
but you can see the parabola really started to snap up in march of 2020 when the pandemic came
lots of stimulus checks were printed in order to give to us citizens and other people in need of that extra money
and subsequently, the money supply, the m2 money supply, absolutely shot through the roof
so let's look at what happened with bitcoins growth from the pandemic low
because, just like you can see down here, this was when the pandemic scare came and the money printer started going brewer at this moment in time
so what was bitcoin's growth from the bottom of the pandemic scare to the top? once again, a very modest 1700 increase
but what do you think is going to happen when we account for the money supply that's been absolutely exponentially increasing? so we know that in terms of us dollar terms, we've moved up 1700, but let's look at how much it's increased in real terms
so when we account for the money supply, you can see we've only moved up approximately, once again, approximately a very modest one thousand two hundred percent, instead of one thousand seven hundred percent, representing about a five hundred percent difference, or about another 5x if you did buy from the cycle low
and what you can see is it doesn't necessarily correlate to the exact top
in fact, it starts to correlate to the massive capitulation that we've recently been seeing
but if we do zoom into the growth of the money supply, specifically in the past year or so, you can see that since march of 2020, which correlates to roundabout here, you know, since then, the btc usd pair has so far capitulated about 60, 64, and it's currently down, as of the time of recording, 58
but when we look at when the growth of uh, or when the supply of the money stops increasing, you can see, once again, 63 and 58
so what does this tell us? this tells us that when the fed stops printing, when central banks stop increasing the supply of money, it means that the btc usd and btc usd divided by the m2 is subsequently going to start catching up, because we're dividing it by the m2
and if the m2 isn't, you know, moving too much, it would kind of be like dividing anything by one
so as you can imagine, if you divide hundred dollars by one, you're gonna get a hundred dollars, and it's going to be the exact same so with that being said, let's measure from the peak and see if there's much difference when we do account for the slight increase in the money supply that we did witness from bitcoin's fulltime high
if we refresh this and find from the 1st of november, so this was roundabout here
so if we take out this data, you can see november, we've slowed
we were slowly, slowly increasing until, like i said, we did have a big drop
so when we do look at this, you can see, as as it wasn't increasing too drastically, there's not going to be a very large difference in the percentage between what is going on between these two charts
and subsequently, we can see btc usd capitulated almost 75 so far
and when we look at btc usd divided by the m2, once again, this is almost the exact same
bear in mind, this is an approximation, because i'm sure if i zoom in, i could have drawn this maybe a tiny, tiny bit more accurately
and what you will notice is that these are basically exactly the same
so let's wrap up the video and talk about the market structure
so when we look at btc usd, like we previously highlighted, from the break of the alltime high, it was a 235 increase
however, when we account for the money supply, bearing in mind once again, that a lot of the inflation started kicking around at this moment in time
so when we do measure from the previous alltime high, we're having to account for the actual, real increase, rather than the us
and subsequently, when we look, once again, getting rid of these, because we've already talked about it, just a refresher, when we look at the market structure, what you will notice is, when we do not account for the money supply, bitcoin is currently coming down and back testing its previous alltime high
it's probably going to be very, very different by the time you're watching this
if you're watching this in a week, if you're watching this in a month, you know, god only knows if this age as well, and people are still watching this in a year or so, this chart is going to be completely different by the time you are watching this
however, as of the time of recording this, when we are not accounting for the money supply, bitcoin has seen zero growth from december of 2017 all the way over to now
so what we know from this is from 160 1643 days, bitcoin has seen a zero percent gain, zero percent loss, meaning that it has had no growth since 2017 all the way over to the current period in time
however, when we account for the money supply, once again, a refresher, why do we do this? why are we looking at bitcoin divided by the m2 money supply
once again, just like i talked about with that um example of, if you're at work, if you've got a 50 increase in your wages, but inflation is uh, is going up by 100, that simply means that, you know, you may have got 50 percent extra dollars in your pocket, but what those dollars can buy is less
so subsequently, if inflation's 100 and you get a 50 wage increase, your real wages are down 50
so when we do account for the inflation, what you will notice is we have not had zero growth over the past, um, over the past five years, approximately, what we've actually had is negative growth
and how does this make sense? well, what this means is that, obviously, when you are increasing the money supply, it makes sense for everything to go up
even if you've got things like, um, you know, chairs and food that you would buy very commonly a grocery store or a walmart, or wherever you would buy these from, all of the prices of those are going up in us
but when we are accounting for the money supply, you can see that bitcoin may have had zero growth when we're not accounting for the money supply, but when we are accounting for the money supply, we are actually down 37 approximately, which is very interesting
and what does this mean? this simply means, when we're accounting for the money supply, bitcoin has not grown as quickly as we would have wanted to
it has not gone up as euphorically as we would have wanted to
and it's actually gone down in the past five years, which is actually something that we've not seen before
i mean, obviously there's been high inflation before, but what we're witnessing right now is basically a parabola in terms of the amount of inflation that's coming in the economy
and subsequently, once again, the price of everything goes up
but in terms of what bitcoin is actually doing in terms of real prices, meaning if you bought one bitcoin five years ago and you sold that bitcoin, you may have been able, let's just make it simple, you may have been able to buy a bmw with that one bitcrane because, you know, as you can see here, the price of bitcoin has not grown at all
so if you simply sold the bitcoin, uh, that would be twenty thousand dollars
let's just say, hypothetically, you'd be able to buy one bmw of that
but now, when we've got all this inflation, the prices of cars, food, all of that is going up
and subsequently, you can see, if we're looking at this, and let's just say, once again, one bmw equals x amount of money, we now have one take away, 037
so once again, that is a percentage 37, meaning that hypothetically, once again giving you the most simple explanation as we possibly can, if you had x amount of money, and that one bitcoin was able to buy x amount of goods, you are now only able to buy 063
in other terms, 63 of that same basket of goods, or the same car, or whatever you are looking at at that moment in time
so this is how bitcoin is affected by the money supply, as you can see
in the short term, when we do see these massive, parabolic increases in the money supply, in the short term, for bitcoin, this will equate to a large increase against its us
dollar denominated value, but once that inflation starts kicking in and settling in, with things like the cpi, which is the consumer price index, measuring the inflation for a common basket of goods bought by a common consumer, you can start to see that once, once again, inflation starts to settle in in the mid to long term, the growth starts to diminish
dollar denominated terms, but in terms of real terms, it is not growing as fast as you think
and when it comes down, it's going to come down a lot harder than you think
i hope that gave you a positive insight on how the money supply affects bitcoin
once again, this is a simple one episode update that i have supplied on my educational playlist
by the time i've uploaded this, this will be my 24th educational video
so if you do want to learn everything about bitcoin, everything about trading, how to read charts, how to put moving averages on your chart, how to understand bullish crosses, death crosses, ema ribbons, fibonacci's elliott wave theory, i provide all of that stuff on my channel for completely free
so the bitcoin price is twenty one thousand and twenty five dollars
you can see a lot of the bitcoin bulls are getting very, very excited over here
i'm gonna have a look at a whole bunch of different charts, but it is going to be a relatively quick stream as i speed through, as not that much has changed actually
it is bitcoin on the four hour and you can see the bitcoin price, of course, tested the range lows at eighteen thousand dollars
we set a very, very sloppy higher low, and then followed by another very sloppy higher high
and if you really want to nitpick, you could call this area over here, let's just move that hold on a second
you could call that next area over there as your next higher low relative to this zone on the left hand side
and pretty much bitcoin price is just kind of stuck within this range
and i'm not really going to get too excited about anything until we either leave the top side of this range or the bottom side of this range
you can, of course, buy midrange, target the top range, sell, and then target back down
so if you're playing it kind of something like this, break above, you buy, maybe readd to your position, sell in this zone over here, and then target back down to the bottom
the downside, not much has changed, but there is some signs that volatility is about it into the market and that there could be some sort of change and movement out of this range
and if you have a look here at the forex factory calendar, you'll find that not today, but tomorrow, uh, fed chair powell will be speaking, so we're going back into all these fomc things that every single time, when these numbers are released and the cpi data results come out, and the job reports and the quarterly close and all of that, that is setting up for potential move so i'm still remain very, very neutral
and if you have a look at the bitcoin dominance, you can see that it's almost come down to test our trend line at 4272
i would expect some sort of a reaction off of that, a bounce off of that, and most likely have that left as a deviation
so something like this, i would anticipate probably a bounce, break back up above midrange, and then go back to range high
so if it is going to be a selloff, then i would anticipate that is probably the furthest that alts are going to go into this level over here
and then most likely, that reaction offer is going to take the liquidity back into bitcoin
one thing that always makes me a little bit nervous is, of course, the bear moons
she said that she is expecting some sort of a pump today, and then leading into tomorrow, um, it will probably start selling off again
and if i have a look at other indicators in combination with this, because this isn't a fortune telling show, we're not going to only just look at you know, our hourly glass over here, we can have a look at other things like the volume
the volume is declining, so i would expect some sort of a breakout from this volume as well
when volume does eventually kick in and you break this zone over here, then that is probably when the next major move will come into play
now, i also have the 22 moving average that's been thrown on on the daily over here
so any time that it's angled down and prices below it's really struggled to get back above it
it had a slight chance over here in this area at about 32 000, some people got bullish
but overall, you still have the descending trend line coming down, governing the lower highs throughout
and even if we do recapture it, you still got to contend with that zone
now, in the previous show, i had this as your main liquidity area and your main level to clear
i've now moved that down to this area, because we work level to level
this is now going to be your new most important zone to clear
remember, of course, for the traders, the shortterm traders, there's always a trade, right? you can sculpt, you can go long and short daily, and both people can still make money, because the market has been moving nicely for a trader, for a day trader
but for those of you who are probably working your 9 to 5 job, or maybe you run your own business, and you're looking to be in these moves for weeks to months, this is kind of the way that i personally trade
i would definitely wait for a clearing of this area over here
if you manage to get back above these zones, which is going to be a around 31, 500, you're gonna clear the horizontal resistance over here
and on top of that, you're going to clear the diagonal trend line that's been coming down
and on top of that, then i would expect that this 2ma would start to flip back up like that
as also, if you saw price do something like this, now you can start testing it properly and using it as an uptrend
but until that happens, there really isn't any reason to look for longterm investments, in my opinion
dollar cost averages always when in the end okay, having a look at this chart of yeah, again, it's a bitcoin price on the fourhour chart
and what i've done is i've thrown on the, it's called the cm guppy uh, super guppy uh indicator, which essentially measures out a whole series of different, you got a lot of different uh emas and mas all congested in here
my point is, and what it means for you, is that any time that this starts to go gray, there is a potential new move that's coming
you want to get, again, back above that horizontal resistance that would allow this guppy indicator to potentially flip green, something like here, what you see over here
can you see that? and then that keeps you in a nice trending move
so again, talking more to the longer term investors, the traders, look today, if you're looking for longs, you might get lucky, but it's a very risky environment
i'm not taking any trades yet, but i am soon going to look for trades there
on the one hour chart, your bollinger bands, you can see that they're starting to pinch together and squeeze
and whenever that happens, once you start to break out of one side, you see volume kick in, then you'll be looking for an expansion off of that move
any lungs from here? yes, although possible for leveraged traders that are looking for longs, they're going to probably run out of steam as soon as you start to hit that 200 ma around 24 000
so you it can be a decent move, right? let's say you start to break out of that roundabout over here
let's just move that on to now, in terms of your your higher lows and higher highs, this is starting to establish a little bit of a better trend
so you got your lows, highs, higher low, and now you got your slightly higher highs
but again, sloppy, and it's attempting to make a higher low in this zone over here
so regathering the moving averages, here's your next higher low
so you'd want to be targeting at least back to the top of the range, which is coming in at this candle
if it starts to break above that, then your trend is pretty much established on the one hour, and that's coming in at 21 700

[Music], hello and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so bitcoin is currently dropping quite strongly, as you can see just now
um, so there are a few things that we now need need to talk about
so we had here a couple of scenarios on the chart that i made you aware of
and so, you know, you should actually know what what's happening now
showed you that in the last couple of videos quite a few times
we moved up, or we are moving up in a wave three here in purple
in the wave three, there are obviously sub waves here, wave one, a wave two down
now, what's what is now going on here? so in the previous video, we talked about that this
yeah, as possible wave count in a wave 2 here, based on the assumption that this wave one in purple was complete, this wave two in purple was complete, the wave three in purple currently ongoing here
now, it looked like it was complete, yeah, or it could have been complete, but i told you there are two key levels we need to get above
first important level is this one here that we didn't even reach
so from that point of view, it was in no way confirmed that the wave c had completed
we have now to say that, um, we could still be in this scenario, yeah, as i and i gave you the next support level for this
and we can just have a look, oops, and have a look at these fibonacci retracement levels
but i, i think i said to you in the previous video, should we now go below the 618 percent fib level, which we have done, now, in my opinion, what will get more likely then is not this scenario anymore, which means that the other scenario gets more likely, in which we have completed the wave one in purple, then we came down in let me show you, in a wave a
and this is what we can now make work better based on the wave count
and i always try to show you the scenario that adheres best to the elliott wave principles, in my opinion, it is now this one
and we can also make that work from a wave count point of view
so what i'm gonna do now, i'm gonna, i have to take, let me just think, because i want to make it work, you know, um, i have to take this count out, of course
that means what we've done here is we've come down in a large wave a, we have moved up in a wave b, and we are now moving down the wave c
now, if you think about why is there a five wave move well, that is purely because this wave b, again, consists of an a, b, c
so within this, just to show you that within the wave b, you have a wave a, which is a five wave move, a wave b down and a wave c to the upside
so, um, so this is then what we would expect now as next likely option
and we can revisit again those fibonacci retracement levels in the yellow target area, just to double check if the yellow target area is still likely
so in this scenario, what would now be likely? yeah, it would be this area here, starting at the 50 fibonacci retracement level, which is here around 196 k
now, this is certainly a realistic another very likely option would be the 191 k level, the 618 percent flip level, and maybe even the 184 k level
and i also have to tell you very clearly, should we go really significantly below that 184 k level, i think then we have to just go with a bearish wave count, because bitcoin is struggling
um, we can certainly count this as impulse here, still, as a wave one
but then, based on this, we have to, we have to say, you know, we've really, only, based on this wave count, seen a wave one here so far this year is a wave two, and the wave three has never started yet
so while there is, of course, in this scenario, still a chance to break out, we are still very early this this move down now has basically thrown us back a wave count, yeah
or we have to go to the higher level wave count, which means, um, the next wave that looked like it had started already just never started
and this just gives you the orientation now where we are on the chart
that means we have a first impulse up, but it is just still in the wave 2 currently
and again, i told you all the time that unless we go above the 233k level, there is still significant downside potential
but again, i also have to say to you again, and remind you what i said before, there is still significant downside potential until we break above that level
and that is what we don't know at the moment, because we have really seen only a wave 1 and maybe a wave 2 here
this could all still be a corrective wave, as i showed you now in in other videos already
yeah, only yesterday, i believe, i showed you that, um, that in the bearish wave count
we already have a three wave move complete, and we could now start the impulse down
and in my opinion, this will get much more likely, this bearish move, if we move below that yellow target area here, so between 184 k, which doesn't mean it couldn't still reverse below it, yeah
so this is the highest likelihood of a turnaround for this current wave 2
and if we don't turn around in this yellow area, then we are probably gonna see lower lows for bitcoin
so this is where we currently are, and we just have to see, um, how this is going to develop
just to continue to repeat that, if we are in an uptrend, we are still very early
and if we are not in an uptrend, then we are probably gonna see a lower low, yeah
and this is just a corrective wave up um, and again, until we break above this key resistance area that i've had now on the chart for probably a couple of weeks or so
um, that there is just still downside risk, yeah, or significant downside risk
so, um, where does it leave us? well, for now, we can assume that we will turn around in this yellow area
but again, it is uncertain, because we are still only in the very early stages here of a possible uptrend
but as i said to you, i can't tell you if that really will happen now, or if that rally will happen after another lower low, because we are just in this possible turnaround space, you know, we are in this turnaround space, and there is still a lot of uncertainty
for now, we are following this scenario here, a one, a two, because this is for me the next likely scenario
yeah, it has not been invalidated yet, and we need to, we need to see how we are doing, how we are going to do in this yellow target area, and maybe to complete this here
um, this wave count in the wave c, where are we currently with that? so we have, in my opinion, completed down here wave one
we now wait for the wave three, in my opinion, here, then there will be a wave four and a wave five to the downside
and from a shortterm point of view, one scenario, well, it hasn't been the other, the first scenario i showed you, it hasn't been invalidated, but it just gets less likely, which is why i've now taken it out
and what you just need to understand on the lower levels, yeah
i mean, we're look really doing here, lower level wave counting, nearly micro counting
yeah, this is just always very fragile these scenarios move around very often because there are just so many possibilities the higher you go on the wave um, the how the higher you go on the time frame, the less often these will get changed
so from november until today, i have never changed my scenario, the higher level one
they transform, of course, as neta changes and as we always have to adjust to the latest price developments and just our strategies

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
um, first of all, just would like to start at the higher level wave count, because a few people have asked me what sort of the higher level wave count for bitcoin, in my opinion, is um, because i know a lot of viewers come in new and it can be confusing
you know, i i mentioned it in videos regularly, but of course, not in every video
so from my point of view, here, we've created a wave one, a large wave one, in april 21
i already made you aware back in november december that we would probably see a crash in a wave c here, into the region below 286 k
we have to go below the low of the wave a from june 21 or july or june 21
the elliott waves were able to help us to forecast the current price range in which bitcoin is seven months in advance
yeah, where, for example, um, investors or traders that use other methods would not have necessarily seen that
yeah, there were, for example, the course that, you know, if if you, um, because of all these support levels that were here on the way down, that, you know, we would hold them
but, but the elite wave method was pretty much the only one that i'm aware of that was able to point us towards those current price levels in which we are at the moment
target area was 286 to 20k, and we have come perfectly into it
and therefore also, uh, i'm telling you that we could now be reversing back to the upside
that is what in such an expanded flat pattern, abc has to happen
you have to come though below the low of the wave a with your wave c
yes, other interpretations were possible, but i always told you that this was the most likely one
we can only, all we can do is speculate based on probabilities
and so far the probabilities have been very, very well on our side
we even hit perfectly the 17 500 level, which was one target level of the lower level wave count that we talked about, um, a few days before
now, i can't guarantee you at the moment that it was the absolute, um, last low, and that we are not going to go lower
in fact, there is still significant risk that we do, because we are now in a potential turnaround space down here
but if the markets really decide to go up, we could see a significant rally in a wave three
now, i know a lot of people don't believe that because of the economic situation, but a lot of people also didn't believe that we would get below 30k, and we didn't have a war back then, in november, right? so just to remind you, so what else? um, it doesn't need to be a wave 3 the next rally up
so there are different wave counts possible, within which we could, for example, see all of this here as just a wave a
so i'm just telling you that i personally believe there will be a rally, a significant rally that nobody expects, um
but everything is pointing towards what we are currently seeing, those prices, as being significant lows
and also, the elite wave count suggested that we could have ended a cycle at 17 500, which was the 18th of june
okay, um, from here, therefore, we are now seeing first impulses emerging to the upside
and these are impulsive wave counts, which means they suggest that we could indeed have turned around
yeah, we have to go above the 23k resistance level here to confirm that further
but looking at the lower level wave count, where we currently are, we came up in a wave one, in my opinion, here, we came down in a wave 2
we are now in this wave 3 in purple, which should peak around 26 500
within the wave 3, we are in the sub waves, wave 1 up, wave 2 down, and possibly now wave 2 has ended
yeah, we talked about that in the previous video, that the wave 2 has hit a target area
yeah, it was one of the fibonacci retracement levels, the 618, which is an ideal retracement level for the wave 2
but every swing high we're now taking out will give us a better clue
if we get above that, i think we can safely assume that the wave c has ended
proof for that, or evidence, would be above 218 k, if we break above the wave b high here
and if we do that, then the wave 3 should take us into the region of around 23k over the next trading sessions here
um, if we go lower, yeah, if we make another low below 205 k, then i would even assume that, um, we're not looking here at this one, two, yeah, then we are, probably
and that would then be my favorite count, that we're actually going into this yellow target area here, uh, between 188 k and 196 k, based on the assumption then that actually this wave 2 has never finished in purple, that we only saw a wave one up and a large a, a large b, and the large c is now on the way
so i told you now, in which you know which levels need to break that will make me favor this count um
and these are the levels we need to take out, these key resistance levels here
and, you know, evidence that we are going higher and that this wave 2 is finished, real evidence, would only be obtained above the wave b high
unfortunately, because it seems to be an overshooting wave b, this evidence in this case will be obtained very late
yeah, normally the wave b would not overshoot the preceding high, but it does in this case
and therefore, you know, normally a break above the wave b high already gives us a really good clue
unfortunately, in this case, because the wave b is the highest wave here, we have to wait until that is broken
but then from here, i would expect a rally all the way up to 23k in this wave 3
and that wave 5 up could take us indeed into the region of 26, 26 and a half k
but what i can tell you is that for now, i'm assuming that this is just a corrective wave down, and that we are going to reverse further to the upside
this is what um is, for me, the most likely count at the moment
most likely, not because i like it, but because it fulfills for me most um rules of the eliot wave method
yeah, it is the the one that appears best to the elliott wave principle

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so bitcoin is holding around 208 k, pretty much sideways movement at the moment
and yeah, we've seen the same picture on various altcoin charts
here actually is rather the picture, um, short term downside, short term negative
after we had yesterday, a little bit of a corrective move down, in my opinion, on the bitcoin chart, the alt altcoins are following as usually, they follow more strongly
and so yeah, i think the over the high level picture here for most altcoins is rather down, and bitcoin as well
and i told you yesterday that we are waiting here for bitcoin in this wave c now of this wave 2, for a five wave move
so there's a few things here worth pointing out that, in my opinion, could tell me that we are, um, already reversing here, and might be getting back to the upside now
um, by the way, someone asked me why we're not considering this as an ascending wedge breakout
you see that on the log chart, but also on the arithmetic chart
the problem is, we haven't really had a strong reaction to it
the move that is coming down here, for me, is not strong enough, really
um, [Music], these breakouts of trendlines and patterns, i mean, they, they can work
but targets for these wedges, for example, which, by the way, would be down here, yeah, would be the beginning of that move up
um, [Music], with the elite waves, you come to a completely different conclusions, uh, conclusion that that's just what it is
and, um, it's oftentimes that, you know, there's different approaches to ta, different approaches to trend lines
and when you break a trend line, yes, the immediate uptrend is over, which we saw here
but this doesn't necessarily mean we have to go down here, to the beginning of the wedge
you know, we had to take, we would have to, i believe, if we take out this swing low here, yes, 19 700, there's a good chance we go down
but even then, we have a target area here, based on fibonacci retracement levels, where we would get into
so my view is that we moved up here in a wave one, we've come down in wave two, and we are now moving up in a wave three here in purple
in the wave three, we are in a wave one and also a wave two correction
and we have come down in this wave two now to a perfect retracement area for a wave 2, which is the 618 fibonacci retracement level
so normally you would expect sort of the 50 here, at 207 k um, the 618, maybe the 786, which would be here, the pre at the previous wave 2 swing low
now we have come down here to the 618, seen a strong reaction to it, yeah
and came down again, and we've seen another, basically another strong reaction to it
we can basically count this as an ending diagonal, which usually would happen in a wave c
so an ending diagonal, you can have in in that you can have overlapping waves
it's basically one, two, as already indicated in the last video
then i told you that this could be the way three here, possibly rather this one with a long wick to the downside that touched the 618
and we already, depending on how you draw the the wedge here, yeah, we're already breaking out of that wedge to the upside
so there is a chance that this is over already, this move down, that this wave c is over
yesterday, i gave you, um, i believe, a target for that wave c, um, that was based on the length of the wave a, and we added it to the high or the beginning of the wave
and i believe a target i gave you was to twenty thousand seven hundred dollars
now we moved even lower, to the sixty one point eight percent flip level
even went a little bit further down, and now we are possibly reversing
um, and yeah, we now it's time to look for evidence that this wave c is indeed complete
if this is the bullish wave count, and yes, we can count this as an impulse, absolutely
we need to go through this red box, which is between 23k and 233 um
um, [Music], if it goes below 20 460, so basically below the 618 percent fib level
around that 20 200 mark here, the 786 fibonacci retracement level
and as i said in the ethereum video yesterday, if the next one is here, this wave 3 in white, then we will find that out very soon, because we should see a fairly swift start here to the upside
and real evidence, um, or at least a really good indication, that this wave c is over, i believe, would be obtained first of all, above that swing high here of 21 thought
and the best you can get, but then we already here breaking out above wave b is 28, 21 860
um, we can go down lower, as i said, even in this scenario here
and really the entire impulse would only be invalidated below twenty thousand five hundred dollars
now, at the moment, this can still be, uh, all of this can also be a bearish scenario, as i said before, um, which is this one here, where we came down in a wave three, also here on the 18th of june
this retracement here has already been um has already done what it needs to do as a minimum
but in most cases, you would expect bitcoin to reach the um 382 percent flip level, which is here pretty much at 23k
now if we go above the 23k level, it just gets less likely that it still is a wave 4
it could, though, still go all the way up to 247 k in a 50 retracement
but on the other hand, from a fibonacci extension point of view, if we go above the 1618 extension um, which is above 23k, yeah, four, i believe the wave one here, then it gets quite likely that we're actually really going up further
even better would be a breakout above 25k to invalidate here the wave 4
it could theoretically go all the way up to around about 29k, but then we need to see that the wave 4 would be actually too long to be because it has retraced a bit too much
all the wave 4 is not allowed to do is it is not allowed to get into the wave 1 price range
but if it goes up that much, it is actually retraced too much for a wave 4, and it would just be very, very unlikely it is still a wave 4
and if we then see a strong reaction here and an impulse down, we could say that we are actually on our way to break below seventeen thousand five hundred dollars again
but at the moment, i'm focusing here, still, on the bullish wave account because we can, and because we have to be, you know, we shouldn't focus on what we think the external environment does
we should focus on what we think is based on the elliott wave count, the scenario that fulfills most of the elite wave requirements
and for me, it is, at the moment um this one here, yeah, the bullish count
there is, for me at the moment, no reason, necessarily to focus on the bearish count, because we have counted five waves to the downside here
and we can count an impulse here, correction here, impulse here, correction here
there is, for me, at the moment, no reason to doubt that this is an impulsive move up, of course
therefore, i highlight to you this important resistance level that we need to break to get further confirmation

in today's episode, i will show you why i sold the market around 21033, and why i do have my target at 19 945
if we're using the fibonacci from the last lower high and the break of structure that we saw on this option, i did have a settlement order
and that is why the market activated it, because we came back up and retested the 50 and the 61
and my take profit is based on the same fibonacci that i sold the market from
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you what i see on bitcoin and ethereum right now, and why i'm in a short position on bitcoin
i'm going to start off with showing you that i'm in a cell position right now on bitcoin
i did have a sell limit order, and i had it at the 50, at 21033
we also did retest the sixty one point eight percent at twenty one thousand one hundred and forty
i chose to take the fifty percent because i just, you know, wanted to do that
don't forget that you can also receive the best bonus available up to four thousand four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
you also know it by now that we do have it somewhere here in the corner
and we can see that the market did close exactly below the key level, twenty one thousand and forty uh
we saw the market push back up a little bit above it, but then we saw the market close below it again
so we saw the market, if we're looking at the lower time frames, if we're looking at the lower time frames, we can see that the market created high highs and higher lows, came back up to the previous higher high, and we did break below it
and what happened? what yesterday, i spoke about this one yesterday, that we saw the market trying to break it, close below, came back up, retested that same resistance
and we saw a fake up to the upside right from this resistance
this is clearly a sign that the market is on its way to the downside
but we also have the the support trend line that is also helping us, this one that is connecting, uh, connecting the higher lows with each other
but then when we start to see that the market is actually breaking, i wanted to see this
i i had it against my support trend line, against this low at one to 1040, because we never broke the previous higher low, as you can see right here
and that gives me a better price than when i actually see the market breaking
we kind of didn't know exactly that the market was supposed to go down until we actually broke the the higher low
because when we drag the fibonacci from the last lower high to the lower low, uh, it doesn't look so good right now
but you can see how the market is exactly inside this fibonacci level where we do expect the market to drop back down
by just following market structure, combined with the fibonacci, combined with trend lines, support and resistance zones, etc, we didn't have the power to break above the previous resistance at 21 400
so i took the fibonacci from 21 338 back down to 20 000 and 700
and this is where i sold them, or i had my my settlement order based on this fibonacci
and so i do expect the market to pull back down, uh, tonight, around 19 940
hopefully, hopefully we don't see this, because if that's the case, my stop looks going to get taken, and we don't want that
so, yeah, what we can do is that we're dragging another support trend line
because you obviously see the market doing high highs and higher lows on every time frame
we just might see the market, based on the break of structure of this support trend line, you know, you see the impulsive move support, which potentials, uh, impulsive move
but we just might see the market pull back up and retest 21 000, slightly below 21040, key level, uh, and or potentially twenty, one thousand and twenty
so we just might see you pull back up, and for hopefully, the market will then continue to drop, uh, back down
and the same thing on ethereum, where we're taking the support trend line, we're connected with the dots
and what i also the dots is the higher lows, uh, break up structure
we tried to retest the sixty percent, six to one point eight percent at one thousand two hundred and thirty three, but, um, we just i'm, i'm not sure if that this is gonna happen
so, um, another confirmation is that we're using, on the 30 minutes chart, this previous, this little support
so if we see that the market from nowhere's breaking, we can use that level, uh, to see if we come back up and retest, potentially 1 220, around these levels, and then see the continuation of the drop
but from a bullish perspective, we just might see that if we see the market break above 1 245, that could definitely be the push to the upside
if that is the case, this was only a little small fake out that we didn't have to the downside, or just the consolidation market
um, and it's very easy to lose money in the consolidation market
but the overall, it kind of look, it definitely looks like we can pull back down a little bit more
um, but looking at the lower time frames, we will be able to catch that
so i would just wait for the market to uh, if we are, we just might also pull back up and retest 1233
and that is also a a zone that we that we have connected to the fibonacci
so it's just kind of, it's just a waiting game for me, to be honest, when it comes to ethereum
i want to have a better price, because if i actually see the market break below around 1220, i will sell the market at ethereum
also, thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
i have morning live streams every single day, monday to friday, one hour before london sessions
so figure out what that time is at your time, because in sweden, that's eight o'clock in the morning
means i was a little bit late today, because that is only because my computer was real slow
guys, just a reminder, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can help me reach out to more people
and if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, you should definitely do that
okay, looking at is it tuesday today? uh, we have some news coming out today at 4 pm
um, first of all, looking at the daily i mean, okay, so we are still consolidating between 103680 and this resistance at 104620, around this level on the higher time frames
yeah, we tried to break the, we tried to break the previous high high
if we close below, if we were close below 103656, that could, um, well, that could, first of all, take us back down to the previous support at 102248
if we drag a fibonacci, we can also see the market pull back down, first of all, to 103570 and 10367 in case we would see the market reverse
it does look like we can, you know, see, see the market pull back down even more
i think it around, yeah, i it was around this candlesticks, some one of them here, because i remember i took the tray before i went to sleep
and i did have my take profit at the 618 percent on the fibonacci level
because remember yesterday's live stream, i spoke about that, i did believe that we would see the market push back down
um, would you have some momentum to the upside? where can we potentially go? okay, looking at bitcoin
so we are inside the fibonacci level that we spoke about yesterday
um, so we came back down for a second time, and we tested the 60
if we're just adjusting the support at the resistance trend line like this, we can go to the one hourly chart
so when it comes to buy position on, on, uh, bitcoin, i would only go in for a long position for myself, if i see that the market breaks above 21 040
and that is also combined with, um, the resistance trend line, which means that that could be the higher high
um, that is only if i see the break of this resistance trend line
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna put one alert to that, uh, crossing up on that trend line
because the thing when i look at the daily chart, let's see how loose in the three daily i mean, we do have on the three daily chart, we have one, two, three
so this could be a a lower high, to be honest, a small lower high that we do have on the daily chart on the three, on the on the chart overall, um, hello russia
why it so i would not actually be surprised if we see the market continue down, to be honest, because on the highest time frames, we have the previous day in golfing candle the the next day we closed below 21 040
right now, even if we have some momentum to the upside, if we're looking at to, if we're looking at her, yeah, this kind of makes sense
so on the three hourly, i take a fibonacci from twenty one thousand four hundred and seventy back down to twenty thousand six hundred and twelve
can you see? the sixty one point eight percent is exactly combined with key level
so this is definitely a level where i would look for potential self positions, actually, because we just might even, you know, even be ready to go to the targets that i spoke about in the beginning of this week, because you can slowly, instead, you see how the market is like
we came back and breathed at the fibonacci levels the with the breakup structure, with this candlestick, it looks, looked perfectly
and then now the market starts to create lower lows and lower highs on the lower on
so i would not be surprised if we see a push back up to 21 040, potentially 21 140 also, and then see the drop
because remember when i said that, uh, if i would buy the market and break and retest from above, continuation
if we start to see that the market is giving us a reverse to the downside, this is definitely another lower high that just can be created for the market then to continue to drop
because the overall, this is technically a lower high, lower high
and if that is the case, the next impulsive move will break below this last lower high, and that could take us back down to, potentially, first of all, seventeen thousand and forty
so i would not be surprised if this actually happens, because the the movements to the downside is so strong
and now, looking at the lower time frames, what we see is only pullback
so yeah, i'm waiting for the market to pull back up to those levels, to be honest
because if we're also taking support a resistance trend right here, okay, we came back down to the fibonacci level
but the overall picture that we look at, the market is going down
so i'm pretty sure that this could be a reverse um, i don't even if i do believe that we will pull back up to, to, uh, 21 040, either whether the market, you know, continues to the upside or not
this is the target that i can see us coming back down to or up to
um, but i don't have a position right now for a buy, actually, i don't
the market is not giving me any, um, the market is not giving me any confirmation to going for a loan
did we go through this yesterday on yesterday's live stream? we must
so what it looks like right now a bitcoin, sorry, on ethereum, is that we can pull back up to 1206 and potentially 1212
so if the market pulls back up to those levels, i will go in for potential a short position, if the market gives me the ta to actually continue back down
because at the overall target right now, on ethereum, i still believe that even if the market only pulls back down to create a higher low, what we're looking at right now, i don't think that the market is ready
even if we see the break to the upside, i don't think we think the market is ready now
based on the ta that we're looking at, is too it's too strong to the downside, um
when the market gives me that alert, i will see if the market will retest it and start to break to the downside
but if we see the market have a huge momentum and it breaks above these fibonacci levels, i will, i mean, everything depends on how ta is looking around these levels
that is the only thing, that is the only thing that i look at
and another thing that we also can take advantage of is that this little last lower high that we can see, we just might might see the market try to fake us out
but then if we slowly, instead start to see the bigger um candlesticks than after, and we break below this lower high, that is also, for me, and not another confirmation that we're going down
so we can use so many different tools looking at the charts to see, because we just might not come back up to to the 50, because we just might retest this previous lower high
this is also a demand zone that we're looking at, and demands on quick retest than the drop
so i'm actually gonna take this alert on this preview support, first of all, uh, to 1196 to see if we only reached that level
um over all view on nasa, we're gonna, what did it already? retest it
okay, so looking at nasa, the first level that i look at is this previous demand zone that we do have between 1 000, now 11 398 and eleven thousand, one hundred and one one, one, one one one um
so that is definitely, i still believe that the market will continue back down
because if we would break to the upside and see even if, you mean, obviously, with a lot of things that will happen
but at that point we would need to break the previous resistance trend line and create a high, high, higher loan, then see the breakup structure
but if we go down to the, if we go down to the lower time frames
now, the only thing that can kind of confuse me sometimes is the engulfing candles
because you can see right here, with this engulfing candle, when you see that huge candle, a lot of, i mean, most of the time, you can think like the market will continue back to the upside based on that
and we also had it against a previous support and resistance zone right here
so it looks like this could be where the market is actually creating a support, and then, you know, see the market continues to the upside
and then from nowhere, we see the market, you know, could potentially break down
because, based on the fibonacci, we're actually inside fibonacci where we can see the market drop even more
so this is the weekly chart, looking at the lower time frames
we just might, so what happened here looks the same right here, right? so we just might expect the market to consolidate a little bit, and then see the market drop
natalie, ami, you're really the best from all crypto youtubers
raven boy crypto, how are ya sleeping? golden, you're so wonderful
okay, so let's see now then, because we are inside the fibonacci level, right? we are inside the fibonacci level
so in the lower time frames, yeah, it kind of makes sense that the market is consolidating, because the market is usually, the market usually does that
does it work? bernie? hello, how are you? so, yeah, we can see the pushback up to the 618, the 50, at hundred, 12 seventy
so the market is, i mean, the market just might prepare itself to break to the downside
but we're looking at the higher time frames perspective right now
so that is, it just might take some time, like, maybe not forever, of course, but a couple of hours before we can actually see the market, if, if this actually is a valid lower high level, or with if we see the market continue to the upside even more
see on the lower time frames, uh? ben, no, i have never, this is the only fibonacci that i that i've ever used
so this is actually this is actually something that i do like though
if we know, i thought it was up a i, i thought you said, aj, come on, sleeping golden
how are you? okay, so looking at nasa right now, it actually looks pretty good to go short on the market soon
because remember when i told you guys, remember when i told you guys that i used to support streamline on the lower on the 15 minutes chart, or and i connected with the dots, this is exactly how it looks
so this could actually be where we okay, so yeah, this is, this looks really good
i'm sorry if i go back and forth like this, but this is just, you know, when i think it just feels good for me to do that
okay, so let's do this too, because we're gonna go through some other pairs
and now it's like, it's not, they go, they always go at the the same direction, but they move a little bit differently
that moves exactly the same nasa has his own little life, to be honest
to meshu, i hope you're here, because right now we're looking at us30
so what? either way, i wouldn't sell the market at all on us 30 either, because we haven't broken the support trend line um
and it looks like we can pull back up if if we have a bigger momentum of 32 000
32 000 k is definitely a level where i look at for the market to come and retest
and other thing also, on the one hourly chart, what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna have a alert if we, if we will, we'll use this previous high as a retest
and either we will try to break above it, or we start to slowly see the market is failing it, and then you see the break of structure, or we break the support trend line
but we still do have some, it doesn't look like it's ready to to break to the downside yet
and this baby, if we drop below one, one, uh, twelve thousand and sixty
and that is only because i want to track the market in case it's all, you know, i don't have to go back and forth inside the into the trades all the time
so if we come, if it comes, if we do come back up to 618 percent, the market will give me the notification
or if we break below it, you can see how we're retesting the 50 at the moment
okay, we're gonna look at amex because i saw that that was one of the requests
my name is natalie, and i i go through cryptocurrencies every single day, seven days a week
um, and we do these morning live streams every single day from monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time

um, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and you already know right now what this is about when it comes to these oh, a lot of money on my account
and if you want to be part of my community, uh, i do have a telegram group, and my wonderful moderators will give that link to you guys, so you are more than welcome to be part of that
i will also link or pin it in the chat, so you can go into it
on this telegram group, we share our knowledge, and we have so many good people on it
and a lot of people are some people are actually very good at trading
and i, you know, the improvement that we've had, and especially sleeping golden, she's crazy
she's been, she's been going local on the charts, and i'm so happy for her
so we definitely have so many people that is, you know, developing as traders
we're no financial advisor, but it's so great to see that people actually learn and share their experiences with each other, and they actually learn
of the whole thing is to teach yourself how to do it, and then you go and you live life however you want to do it
the smarter you get, the more responsibility, right? it feels like new and learning so much
so the monthly chart is pretty heavily, so, i mean, definitely looking, not looking for a buy positions at all
and so what we're gonna do is that, uh, thank you to nat, my one and only mentor
so looking at the weekly chart, what i do, or what i want to do, is that i take flip from 104 back down to 54 dollars
the overall target that i can potentially see is pull back up to because it looks like that we can, if we start to see more momentum to the upside, we can reach 79 or 846 dollars um
i need to go and buy myself a, you know what i talk about, i just don't know the name of it
lucifer, okay, so we i, i changed, i changed the fibonacci from 992 dollars back down to 496 dollars
and we did retest the previous uh or we did retest uh at fifty percent
seventy four point five dollars go down to the lower time frames
we've already seen the breakup structure here, so we just might not have the because i was talking about in the beginning of the week that i that i would see, i saw that we would be bullish, but we just might not be bullish this week
just because i said in the beginning that i think the market will be bullish and then the market is bearish, you just change right? aha, today at the victor bitcoin prize, guys
what we can do is that either we take a fibonacci from 7 to 470, back down to 64
we just might have a pullback now to 683, or potentially 692, if this fibonacci, fibonacci level is valid
she was just about to shoot some seagulls when she saw something on the charts
okay, so let's see what else we can what happened to bitcoin? these morning live streams, i actually love them because i just love them
can you see how perfectly we're not coming back into to the levels on ethereum bitcoin? not yet
i just, i just kind of start to like ethereum charts even more than i like the bitcoin chart
it feels like it's more reliable on ethereum than on bitcoin, for some reason
okay, we're gonna look at 8a, i'm like screaming, hey, hey, like your death or something
i seriously think i made him death on the live stream, because i was like, i'm so happy
i don't know where he is, but i hope he will find his way back here, because i miss him
i miss sebzep and if you look, if he's looking at this live stream
so, yeah, we are at a support and the market has just been going sideways
like, can you see, these two weeks, the market just, you know, we have three weekly candlestick that is just doji's, again, against a support
i'm not even gonna say what's gonna happen, because the market is just so choppy
so, i mean, do whatever you want to but, um, we are going sideways from 5140 and hundred and eight, so just go sideways, but we're going to the low
i'm actually gonna drop eighty eight to be honest, at the moment i saw someone said, xrp
we came back up exactly to the fibonacci levels on the two daily chart
um, looking at the daily we're right now retesting this previous high
but we can also see retest against 3 500 dollars for a potential reverse back down
if we see more, a bigger momentum um, i look at the next fibonacci level, and that is at 3570
if this fibonacci level is valid, i'm gonna use this previous resistance
and if we would break below it and see retest from below, that is, for me, a entry
because right now i don't know if the market will only pull back down to create a small lower high on the 50minute chart, and then see the market push back up
and then we just might see the market consolidate and then see the break
i don't want to get into, early on into it, because the market is just going up, so the market hasn't shown me anything about we're actually going down yet
but these are the fibonacci levels that i that i do speak about
take profit two is three thousand three hundred and thirty seven
guys, you know when you go into the charts and you're like, what can i do right now? what can i do right now? well, we have to wait right now, because even if i sell the market now, the market is not giving me any confirmation
it's not giving me any confirmation yet, right? if i sell the market, the market goes back up to 1212
and i'm like, why didn't i wait for the market to come to this level? and then from nowhere, you see the drop
and especially when you know that you're supposed to wait for it
but we, i actually, well, i definitely think that we are in in some good levels to to find a cell position, looking at you, is 30 and nasa
oh, can you see how perfect this was? okay, looking beautiful
but i'm not gonna go in yet because the market is giving me a pretty strong candlestick
and did we have any news coming out today? in the beginning? we do have some at 2 30, so around new york session
even if the market is giving me some, you know, movements to the downside on the lower time frames, it's obviously the higher time frames that it's pretty important to look at
so we do have this one hourly candlestick that is pretty volatile
don't forget, guys that subscribe to my channel, hit the notification
but because in about four to five hours, i will give you the update on a regular video, a short video that i will show you exactly what happened
if you want to be updated about the trades, potentially, i do have the teller telegram group natalie, bitcoin census, where you can join if we have some updates
um, this is a community that i do, that i did create for for my subscribers guys
we do talk about cryptocurrencies every single day, of course, and share our knowledge
i'm no financial advisor, and no one else in the community either
you can also receive a bonus on buy bit, up to 4 450 dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
good thing with buy bit, when we hold our positions for a longer time, the low fees is the one that we want, right? uh? it's leverage trading
okay, um, i'm gonna end this live stream right now because my computer is about to die, and i haven't fixed it yet, because i did not take that responsibility
twitter is one of them that we do have, um, where me and andy are going and update you with our own thoughts
uh, yesterday i had about xrp, and i think that i also had about, uh, ethereum, yeah
uh, so don't forget to follow us on our other social medias, guys
yes, you already know one, one, one in the chat if you like this live stream
mike, are you kidding me? if you, if you mean in that way, this is the last time you are on this live stream
this is the last time you're on this live stream if you bring up that page again
because does it look like i'm that type of person? no following nuts
my name is josh, and both bitcoin and ethereum are further playing out this short term pullback
so in just a moment, i'll be talking about my next price targets, and also other signals that we need to be paying attention to moving forward
first of all, just taking a quick look at the 12hour bitcoin chart
and obviously, we're still playing out mostly choppy, sideways price action on this chart
and so this shortterm pullback basically falls in line with everything that i've been talking about over the last one to one and a half weeks
because for a moment, we're starting to see a little bit more bullish price action over bearish price action
but right now, having this short term pullback, this is simply balancing out the bullish price action that we've experienced over the past week or so, which means we're still playing out this choppy, sideways price action, kind of like what we saw roughly around a month ago after that previous bullish divergence and the bullish cost in a 12hour bitcoin macd
so when you're talking about this 12hour bitcoin chance, i would still be expecting mostly choppy, sideways price action over the next few days, maybe over the next couple weeks
but as we get closer towards the 13th of july, we could start to see more volatility around that date, especially, and especially on that date and just after that date, because on the 13th of july is when the next cpi data gets released, which updates the official inflation rate of the us
so that means that this sideways, choppy price action might last for, let's just say, another week or so, before we start getting closer towards that inflation day
and just keep in mind that the last day we had cpi data get released, which updated the official inflation rates of the us
dollar, that was on the 10th of june, which was right around here
and obviously that caused another selloff in markets, because inflation on that day came in a lot worse than expected, which meant the fed had to raise interest rates higher than previously expected, which is more bearish for markets
and once again, the next time we get one of those days is in just around two weeks from now, on the 13th of july
but keep in mind, we could only see another move like this to the downside if we continue to see inflation come in a lot worse than expected
but on the flip side, if we get good inflation numbers, better than expected, let's just say if inflation starts coming back down, for example, then that would actually be good news for markets
and we could end up seeing more bullish price action after something like that happens
and in the meantime, taking a look at the four hour bitcoin chart, obviously we're still playing out this rising wedge pattern that broke to the downside a few days ago
and technically speaking, a rising wedge pattern is a bearish pattern, meaning that it is more likely to break to the downside than to the upside
so this, of course, was one of the more likely scenarios over the past few days
and obviously, if you're looking at the rsi and the macd, we were seeing reduced bullish momentum in both the rsi and the macd, and, in fact, some increased bearish momentum in the shorter term
and these two indicators are really useful, because normally they start reversing before the price action even starts reversing
and so now the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern is towards the bottom of the wedge, which is coming into play at around 17 and a half thousand to 18 000
but there is another way you can actually measure a price target for a rising wedge pattern
and you can measure that price target by measuring the width of the entry into this pattern and bringing that over to the breakout point
and as you can see here, that gives us a technical price target at around 183 k
but keep in mind, there are other levels of support along the way between now and then
and those other levels of support do have potential to stop the price of bitcoin even reaching those lower price targets
and these levels of support i'm talking about is mostly this previous low coming into play at around 197 k, up towards 20k
in that small 300 range is where these candle weeks are coming into play, which basically means we've seen previous buying demands come into play at those prices
and if you're bringing out the fibonacci retracement tool from swingload to swing high on this four hour chart, we do have the 382 fibonacci level coming into play at around 201 k, so pretty close to that previous low
and right now, at the time of recording this video, we are finding some shortterm support around that level, but anything lower than the 382 fibonacci level
and anything below that previous low at around 197 k, i'll be focusing on that golden pocket coming into play at around 19 000 as the next downside price target below that previous low
so personally, how i would use those shortterm support levels in my bitcoin strategy, in my shortterm trading strategy, is by simply placing some take profits at around those price levels on a shortterm short position
and also, at this stage, after this sort of price action that we've seen to the downside, after the break to the downside that we saw a few days ago from this writing wedge pattern, personally, in this situation, i'll be moving my stop loss up towards my entry price, and even slightly in profits
and so that way, it's basically a riskfree trade at that point, if the stoploss is in profits or at a break even
because in the worst case scenario for a short position, just here, let's just say, if we immediately reverse back to the upside, then if a stop loss is placed into profits or at a break even, that would simply stop you out of the trade at a profit or break even, depending on where the stop loss is placed
first of all, that is not financial advice for you, because legally i cannot tell you what to do with your own money
i can just let you know what my personal strategy is for bitcoin
and it is also important to mention that this is just a shortterm trading strategy and not a longterm investing strategy
my longterm investing strategy is to remain slowly dollar cost averaging into bitcoin and hold for the long term, as in many years from now
and now, getting into the ethereum parts of this video, this right here is the 12hour ethereum to your solar chance, and it is obviously a very similar thing to the 12hour bitcoin chart
once again, we're seeing a shortterm pullback to balance out that bullish price action we've seen over the past one week or so
but for the most part, on this 12hour chart, i'll mostly be expecting choppy, sideways price action moving forward, potentially over the next week or so, moving towards that inflation date in roughly around two weeks from now
and even on this 12 hour chart, looking in the price oscillators, the rsi and the macd, for example, they are also showing that reduced bullish momentum in the shorter term, resulting in this, the shortterm pullback on the 12hour charts
and these signals are even more visible on the smaller time frames, like the fourhour chart, for example
you can clearly see a pullback, in fact, a downtrend, formed in the 4hour ethereum rsi and the 4hour ethereum macd
and just like bitcoin, ethereum on the 4hour chart has also broken below this rising wedge pattern, which, of course, is once again a bearish pattern
and the technical price target is towards the bottom of the wedge, which is sitting at around 900 per ethereum
but keep in mind, we have that other way to measure the technical price target
and in that case, the price target would be coming in at around one thousand dollars per ethereum, exactly
and that one thousand dollar price target is very close to this previous low, which is coming into play at around 10 40 to 1050
and another reason why we have a lot of support at around 1040 to 1050 is due to the fact that the 382 fibonacci level on the weekly ethereum chart is sitting at around 1050, but heading back to the fourhour ethereum chart
and once again, i mostly expect a bit more of a pullback over the coming days for ethereum against the whistler on this smaller time frame
but as for other levels of support to pay attention to other than these price targets and that previous low, if we bring out the fibonacci retracement tool from swing low to swing high on the four hour time frame, we do have the 382 fibonacci level coming into play at just above 11 k
and anything lower than that, we actually have the golden pocket coming into play at pretty much exactly 1 000, which is very interesting, because that is obviously exactly where that other price target is coming into play, at 1 000 per ethereum
so due to the fact that we actually have some confluence around 1000 and also some confluence around 1050, i'll be looking towards those sort of prices, potentially in the coming days, if this pullback continues
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum versus bitcoin charts on the four hour time frame
and we also have some signals on this chart showing us that this shortterm bullish momentum is beginning to fade away and potentially gain some bearish momentum in the shorter term
now obviously, over the past two weeks or so, we've actually seen a bit of a balance for ethereum versus bitcoin
but during this shortterm uptrend on the fourhour chart, we've seen multiple pumps and dumps along the way
but this time around, we haven't really experienced the pullback, and instead, we've just seen a bit of choppy, sideways price action
so we could be due for a bit more of a pullback for ethereum vs bitcoin
but once again, if you're looking at the rsi and the macd, these are also showing weakness
because first of all, just a few days ago we did see a bearish divergence form for ethereum versus bitcoin on the four hour charts
and just after that, we saw a bearish cross in the fourhour ethereum versus bitcoin macd
and not only that, but the price action that we've seen over the past four to five days on this four hour time frame strongly resembles wyckoff distribution
and technically speaking, this is a bearish pattern where we come from an uptrend, and then we see a high, a higher high, and then a lower high
and then we enter into phase d, where the price action moves towards those previous lows that we set during this range, during the wyckoff distribution
and then eventually, if we break lower than those lows, then we enter into phase e, which is basically a bearish reversal
and just going back to the ethereum versus bitcoin chart on the four hour time frame, i'm sure you can now see this wyckoff distribution in play
and right now we're potentially entering into phase d, where the price action is potentially moving towards those initial lows within this price range
and so if we break below this low right here that we set a few days ago, coming into play at around 00563 bitcoin per ethereum, then we could continue to see more downside price action for ethereum versus bitcoin in the short term
which means, in that scenario, a theorem would be underperforming against bitcoin
and also, check out this video popping up right here if you want to know how you can keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so i'm going to start off this video talking about the basic market structure, talking about the ema ribbons and a fractal that we keep on playing out time after time after time
again, we'll talk about our price target from a breakdown that we talked about a couple of videos ago
we'll look at the sp, why the dollar, and talk about a few news updates
let's jump right into this today now, starting off with the basic market structure
you can see we've created, just like we talked about, a massive rounding top over in the four hourly ema ribbons
we've come up into these and got slapped back down to the downside
i'm actually going to remove the macd simply because i'm going to focus on this more as we come down to the next chart
but as you can see market structure this plays time, plays out time after time after time again
and you know, quite recently, we've had many, many times where we've come up, got rejected from the daily ema ribbons time after time
but right now it seems like we didn't even have enough strength to come up into the daily ema ribbons once again, which should be very, very telling that the market structure for bitcoin is very bearish right now
now, you can also see, it looks like we are breaking to the downside of a bearish pennant
i mean, if i take the price target of this, it's probably going to be like zero, uh, the price target would be, i fat fingered this, it's gonna be around about eight thousand
nonetheless, uh, the breakdown of this pattern in of itself, even if the price target does not get hit, which i'm telling you it probably won't, uh, is not bullish for the market structure whatsoever
now, we also talked about this rising wedge coming up into the four hourly time frames
so it'd be more conservative at this point in time, as we did have a fake out, failed move
since that breakdown, you can actually see that we did hit the price target of this down at twenty thousand two hundred
so we might see a slight relief bounce over the next day, over the next four to eight hours, before we do continue with this move back down to the start of this ascending channel
uh, we have so far moved down about 29, basically three percent, even after this bounce
and subsequently, we still do have about another 26 to head back to the upside before we can expect too much of a relief rally
but nonetheless, i think as we've got such a, such a nasty rounding, rounded top playing out here, i think we're probably going to start losing momentum and heading down a lot quicker than some people expect
i also did talk about this on my twitter but we've got a bunch of potentially bearish things coming in the next month
uh, the next gdp report for the gdp growth in the us, in the next 30 days, approximately
so within the next 30 days, if we get negative gdp growth, we might, well, we will be entering a recession
so subsequently, looking back at previous bear market cycles would probably not make too much sense, considering bitcoin has seen a bear market, but bitcoin has not seen a bear market in a recession
now, i also do want to talk about some bullish news, well at least what i perceive to be bullish news
now, i'm going to make a separate news article about this later, but uganda has recently found a massive pile of gold
i believe it was over 12, yeah, 128 trillion, 320 000 metric tons of refined gold
and once again, this just shows that, you know, as sailor said, michael sailor, giga chad sailor, gold is plentiful
because the market cap of gold is, you know, around about 11 to 12 trillion
i don't check out the market cap of gold every day, but nonetheless, this is approximately the market cap of gold
you know, the supply of bitcoin is going to slowly, slowly, slowly increase over time
bitcoin's inflation is at a set level, uh? from a mathematical perspective, you know, bitcoin is obviously inflationary, but the inflation gets lower and lower and lower and lower over time
a lot of people say bitcoin is deflationary, or it doesn't have inflation
you know, that's not true, because bitcoin has inflation to pay miners
that is a good way to reward the miners for protecting and making the network more stable
but with that being said, there's only going to be so much inflation in bitcoin
and we know, based on the halvings, how much inflation we're going to have every four years or so
if you know, if, if for example, these countries, they keep on getting better mining equipment, then they might just be able to find, you know, more and more stockpiles of gold
that's, you know, that's kind of how gold is, you know, the with the supply and demand perspective on bitcoin, bitcoin, along with a very, very small amount of other asset classes, like rolex, they're basically the only asset classes which supply is not affected by the demand
if more people want bitcoin, then the price is the only mechanism to adjust for those extra people to come into the market
if people want more gold, they will simply, gold miners will simply use that extra money from gold that's been bought to increase their mining equipment, increase their mining power, and subsequently, they'll increase the inflation of gold by using that extra money to mine more gold
if miners want to increase their money by buying better mining equipment, they're simply competing for the same amount of bitcoin
meaning bitcoin's supply does not affect its demand what well, no, bitcoins demand does not affect its supply whatsoever
there's a fixed supply, and it doesn't matter if there's 10 people that are wanting to buy it or, you know, one billion people, the supply stays the same
that is not the same with other asset classes like silver, gold, the dollar, etc
so that being said, in my opinion, this is very bullish news for bitcoin
this is bullish news for bitcoin because gold's supply has doubled in the past couple of days, whereas bitcoins has only gone up by, you know, a couple of hundred bitcoin or so that's been paid out to miners
so also the general markets though, while we are getting bullish news like this for bitcoin, these are really long term, uh, bullish news
these are really not going to affect it too much in the short term
and we know this because the spy, the stock market is still heading down
and i've also noticed the stock market spy is panning out a very, very ugly head
well, this is the left shoulder, head, right shoulder, we're probably going to come down to at least 355, and then probably have a bounce before we do take out the floor of this nasty head and shoulders pass an spy being bearish
you know, the s p 500 the nasdaq, all of these, uh, all of these, you know, tech stocks, um index funds, stock markets, whatever you want to call it, all of them are heading down
you know, the dollar is, time after time after time, making higher highs and higher lows
you know, the dollar is making a very beautiful cup and handle, this moment in time that it is starting to break to the upside of, uh, these are all, once again, punches in the gut for bitcoin
and even in the higher time frames, it's really, really not looking too good, uh, for the stock market or bitcoin
so, you know, that being said, there's a lot of bearish things going on right now
i think if we come over to, because i have another chart, i believe it's this one for the dollar, let me, uh, let me refresh
so if i delete all of this and we head over to the ikonashi's what you can see is we've got an even bigger cup
and then, as you can see here, we've got the channel and this is the handle
and even in the lower time frames, you know, we're breaking out of mini cup and handle patterns
this one that we showed you was the higher time frame cup and handle
dollars exceptionally strong, stock markets exceptionally bearish
and we're already starting to see, you know, the dead cat bounce that everyone was getting out of bed for is already starting to capitulate
the bearish pennant is already starting to break to the downside
even though the price target of this is not going to get hit, we are still looking very, very dire for bitcoin
what is the momentum in the market saying at this moment in time? well, since we've started falling out of this bearish pennant, what you will notice is the squeeze mom on the four hourly time frame is starting to heavily trickle to the downside
if you are a bull, you can see the, uh, the squeeze bomb has had a high and a lower high for the bears and or for the balls
and what we're seeing in the same time frame, panning out for the bears
the bears had a little bit of momentum stepping in, and now the bears are having a lot of momentum stepping in
the lower time frames, the macd, just like i highlighted in the last video, is starting to head down
if we do zoom in, you can see these light red, uh, these light red candles pushing in, meaning that we are running out
all the bears are stepping in and pushing a lot of momentum into the market
also meaning that balls are running out of steam as bears take the cake
again, if we look at the obv the on balance volume, on balance volume is just massively, massively decreasing
uh, not not necessarily a good sign in the short term, as we are heading down on the obv
like i said there, well, there was a lot to talk about with these charts
we are fulfilling these price targets of these bearish patterns, and there's still more bearish price targets to come
if i switch this over to the light side, you can see we had an inverse head and shoulders, which should be a bullish pattern
you know, we broke out, back tested it, you know, kind of emmed out, and it looks like we're coming right back to this again
in my opinion, this inverse head and shoulders is not going to play out, unfortunately, what i say, unfortunately, you know, i obviously don't hope it pans out
you know, just calling bitcoin a currency or an asset class or gold 20 was wrong
that would be like calling, uh, calling the internet the news press 20
so to call it gold 20, or just call it a currency, is basically an insult
and subsequently, i am a massive, longterm believer in bitcoin
so i am very much looking forward to bitcoin going to these lower prices
i want to buy a lot of bitcoin as we do start capitulating to these lower price targets
we've basically been chilling in this orange box, which, once again, i might have to switch back over to the light side so you can actually see the fibs on this
but you know, from our low to the high of the first run up, we back tested the six, one, eight
we've, uh, we've fallen below the 618, but we're still above the 786
so as long as the bitcoin dominance stays above approximately 43 and even 327, we're still going to be in a massive uptrend for the dominance, uh
and i really do think that bitcoin is going to be proven to be king over the next couple of cycles
uh, once again, everything's not really looking too good right now
we've got a lot of negative things coming in, gdp growth, uh, cpi coming in at next fomc meeting
this could be an absolute storm for the economy, and subsequently, we could enter a recession
dollars heading up, stock market's heading down, bitcoin is heading down
the current bitcoin price is twenty one thousand four hundred and forty two dollars
so let's have a look at exactly what's going on here in the chart from a higher time frame perspective, because we do have a new weekly close
and this week is going to be very important, because it should be the quarterly close as well as the monthly close
so what do we have over here? first and foremost, most, notably, you're going to see a lot of talk about this, uh on youtube, across the board
and that is the 200 weekly moving average, which we've now closed one two weeks underneath
what does this mean for the market going forward? well, i can tell you it's not really a great sign
and what happens when when you start closing under these moving averages for more than two weeks at a time? but if price doesn't get moving soon, it will be a bad sign
and i'm going to show you today what i'm looking at on the lower time frames and why i am remaining very, very cautiously optimistic, but leaning more on the neutral side until until price pre action proves to me what comes next
so as mentioned, it's going to take a couple of weeks, but you kind of have to watch how price reacts within this range
and that kind of creates a situation where as price starts to consolidate sideways, we start gearing up for the next big move
now, when you have a look at this chart over here, which is your bitcoin dominance, you'll notice that we've almost come and tagged that 43 area, which are outlined on the previous charts, uh, last week
and what i would expect to happen over here is possibly some sort of a deviation
so i do expect that if it tags this area over here, it will kind of deviate back up
so here's your deviation back above the mid range, and then start to target the top side of the range over the end, that is on bitcoin dominance, which means that alt queens probably don't have that much more
uh, sort of a bullish scenario to play out over the next coming weeks
if, however, you do start to lose that area and you go underneath, retest the diagonal, as resistance and then go down
but, uh, currently we're getting to that kind of point where we need to reevaluate, just sit on our hands, remain patient and wait for a stronger direction of what's exactly going on
you'll notice over here, with the fourhour chart, put on the bollinger bands, look at how low that volume is
so we had high volume over here on the lefthand side, and so far it's just been teetering down, becoming very, very low volume with a squeezing or pinching together of the bollinger bands
and that usually, again, that supports the thesis that the tighter these bollinger bands get, the bigger the next move is that you can expect in the coming days
now, of course, we want to get that direction correct, uh, to be on the right side of the trade
so with the bitcoin price on the four hour chart, you have your range high coming in at 22 879
you have your range load 18 000, and then we have the midrange at 20 300
you can see that price has slowly started to kind of creep up its regain the 2150 ema on the fourhour chart
and very importantly, it's, it's made a sloppy higher high, but nevertheless, it is a higher high
so if i just copy this over here, or let's just grab that one
so over here, relative to that one, you can see that the two closing candles over there are higher than the two closing candles over here
however, i'll show you why i'm going to remain cautious as a bull
because in theory, despite it being sort of a sloppy higher high, you you kind of should be looking to buy the next higher low
and this is kind of my thinking over here, right? you have this horizontal box which is kind of grabbing all the liquidity over here
and because we have the bare moon that's coming up tomorrow, again, here we're back on the bear moon
you can see it's literally going to print tomorrow because we have that
and because it's a sloppy series of higher highs, i would feel much more comfortable if we were able to clear above this horizontal liquidity box over here
if in the next couple of days we can clear back above that and hold above you i would be more comfortable too long
but you kind of want to see something like this, back above retest
now you've cleared these areas over here on the left hand side
so if you can get above about 20, let's call it about 25, 22, 500 in this zone, and you can hold that, i would be more comfortable buying that higher low over here
until then, i'm just going to remain patient, sit on my hand, see how this plays out tomorrow, um
if you look at the momentum oscillators, and what they're showing, if you go on to a daily you can see they are pretty much topping out
i think on the 12 hour they've already started to turn back down

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so in this video, i would like to focus a little bit more, also, on the bearish wave count
um, i've shown you the bullish breakout patterns here in the last few, few days and couple of weeks quite, um, quite detailed
because, you know, we, we are working on a potential breakout here, absolutely
however, i also mentioned to you, until we break this resistance level here at around 23 000, yeah, it's a bit of a zone, there is still significant downside potential
only above this level, that downside potential would get, uh, much, much lighter
basically, we need to get above this level to really confirm that we are here in an impulsive breakout pattern that also has a certain um sustainability
we we take a look at the latest developments on the bullish wave count, but i also will show you the bearish wave wave count
there are basically always two alternatives, a bullish and a bearish version
and i'm going to show you, for both of these, what needs to happen so that each of these wave counts now comes into reality
so at the moment, this is the bullish wave count for bitcoin, assuming that we started down here at 17500, moved up in a wave one here, an impulsive wave one, that is a clear impulse
we came down in a very clear three wave move down in a wave two, and we now are working here on this purple wave three up here, which will peak at somewhere around twenty six thousand, twenty six thousand five hundred
so in my opinion, the most likely one is that we have seen the wave 1 here already
we moved up in a wave b and overshooting wave b, and we are now coming down in a wave c
we were already breaking out here, but it was important to avoid this support
that is why i oftentimes mentioned to you how relevant that retest of a support level is
and i did mention to you before as a possible target for this wave 2 here in white
those trend lines out um the area here around 20, 20 700 to 20 800, around that wave for low that we see here
that was also based on the fibonacci retracement levels for that correction
you can take a look at that, and you can see that we are exactly here in the region between the 382 percent and the 50 fib level
so, um, if we really lose this level, yeah, next support would be twenty thousand four hundred and thirty three
but i think significant support will be found here around twenty thousand one hundred, which is the seventy eight point six percent flip level
not only that, it is also an area of previous support here and here
in also a bullish scenario, we can, in this wave 2, come lower
i even told you in the previous video, if we already go up from here, it would be super bullish, because the retracement for wave 2 was a little bit too short
because if we take a look again at those fibonacci retracement levels, we did not even retrace down to the 382 percent fib level
and even would reach the 50, which is for a wave two, absolutely okay
now, i wouldn't be surprised if we now even see the 618 or the 786 fip level
now, we can also take a look at the targets, just based on taking the fibonacci extensions here
yeah, from a target point of view, not not looking at the retracement levels, that is one way of measuring the targets
another target would be by looking at the length of the wave a and projecting this onto the wave c
so to find out when a wave c could be finished, you take the length of the wave a, you add it to the wave b, or to the high of the wave b, in this case
so again, from that point of view, actually, the, uh, wave c could now be complete
wave c consists of five waves, a, one, a, two, here, i would say, a wave three
um, so at the moment though, you know, we could possibly count it as wave three, but it would be a very short one
personally, even though the target for the wave c matches, i would rather think we come down a little bit lower, given that we actually cannot really, in a clean way, count five waves yet
and again, a possible one for that would be that wave too low here
so technically, from the retracement levels, targets reached, but the wave c, i would say, is missing another leg down
okay, so that, in my opinion, could reach it at twenty thousand two hundred dollar level
okay, so that is the bullish wave count, because from then, from here, then, if that wave two is finished, we would reverse to the upside in a wave three, here in white
yeah, those targets for the wave three will shift now a little bit, given that the wave two moved down a little bit lower
they will move a little bit lower now as well for the wave three
um, but again, then we work our way up here, and we'll reach, in that way, of three in purple, the area around 26 500
and this is, again, just here, a snapshot here on the four hour chart, the bearish wave count would assume also here, we came down the wave three, moved up, in a way, four here
we have to count this slightly differently, and would then come to the conclusion that this was only the wave three
and in such a retracement of a wave four, let's take a look at where we actually are
so from the wave to um peak here, we take just the retracement levels, and you can see that we have reached the minimum retracement for a wave 4 already
this also gives you the idea why i'm telling you that we will really need to get through this 23k level resistance to make it less likely that this is still a corrective wave
so if we push through here, it will get less likely that it is still a corrective waveform
now we could have really the the view here that we are only in a corrective wave up, and we already starting our wave down
this is also previous resistance um here from the 16th of june
at the moment, we have three waves only here, okay? but if we have one more up, then we could already look at something more bullish
and what would be the targets? and for that, for the low? yeah, for the targets, there are a few targets, um
so if we look at now targets here for this fifth wave, what we can do is we take the length of the wave 1, and we add it to a possible wave 4 high
we cannot really calculate it yet, because we don't know yet where the wave four will be
but the higher the wave four goes, if it is the wave four, then also the target for the last dump will move higher
if i move that higher, you see that those targets go up as well
i'll now move it to 23k, because that, i think, that is a very realistic level 404 here
and then we can take a look at these fibonacci extension levels
so you would normally expect here the 1618 extension, absolutely realistic
but that would even be a higher low compared to the wave three
i think that would be, um, the beginning, yeah, of the target here, of the target range, the 200 percent extension
and honestly, i think we can go down all the way here to the to the 3618 extension
and it is at the moment not possible to calculate that further in more detail, until we know how the first subwaves of that fifth wave look like
so that nearly goes down, that nearly goes down to the um, to the 887 flip level four for bitcoin as well, which is around 106 k
i guess we could even, we could even activate the 400 extension here
just do that, because that should, yeah, so let's just do that, because then it goes down to the 887 percent flip level
but anywhere in here, with these support levels here, um here, always the the 200, the full numbers, or the 0618 usually, will then act as more significant support um
then we've got 14852, 13 661, 11 300, 11 735 and around 10 500 here
and when we then peak in the wave four, and when we then see the first wave and the second wave, then we can calculate the next targets more precisely
but, um, these are the things that need to happen to make the bearish or the bullish wave count happen now
to invalidate, for example, this bullish wave count, we need to go, you know, honestly, we just have to go below 17 500
until then, unfortunately, we can make this work in a bullish scenario, yeah, because the wave one, though, this was a wave one and the wave two here, yeah, is not allowed to get below that beginning of the wave one, and that is at seventeen thousand five hundred
and then we would reach one of these target levels that i've just indicated
and it is just very early in a possible uptrend, and therefore, things are still very much in the making, and we need to keep an eye on those resistance levels
at the moment, my feeling, yeah, would be that we are actually here already working on our breakout, um, and that we are indeed starting to move up
but i cannot confirm this until we break here, at least that's 23 000 level

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
yeah, again, here, also, not too much movement, but it may be starting already, to push higher here
so generally, it is looking like at the moment, that we are here back in an uptrend
so that means we could, with a realistic chance, have seen the low here at 17 500
and to get further confirmation, i've said very clearly in previous videos, we need to get above this resistance zone, above 23 to 233 k
someone asked me how i can already talk about rising prices given that we are not in an uptrend yet
well, we are certainly in a shortterm uptrend here, but we haven't broken this resistance level, and that is the key point where we need to get above
but also, and that is very, very clearly and very important to understand, the elite wave method works different to what, let's say, usual trend analysis works like
the elite wave method method has specialized in forecasting trend reversals
therefore, um, with this method, you can forecast trend reversals probably better than with any other method
that is why i already talked about the possible uptrend here that is emerging, because we can see the first, well, first of all, the the trend down
technically, the requirements for this move down, which did lead all the way up, all the way down to 17 and a half k, all these requirements have been fulfilled
we could all count all these waves as complete and now we even can count five waves up, three waves down
the more often this happens, that we can count five waves up, three waves down
it just indicates and confirms that we are in an uptrend and that we indeed might be working on a bigger break out here
but again, this resistance is still alive here and still in in intact so we need to take it out
we need to take this resistance level out between 23 and 233 k this is very important, um
so these two scenarios, um, are currently what we're looking at
it depends on how far we come down now in a wave 2, because it could be this wave 2 which will not come down that far, or it will be this wave 2 which will probably go into this yellow target area here
for me, as i said in the previous video, primarily, yeah, it was the second
uh, that we are here in this scenario where we have the smaller wave 2 still to complete, and that the purple wave 2 is already complete
because if the purple wave 2 isn't complete, all of the move that we've seen here, yeah, um, from that wave one in purple, yeah, to the downside was just a wave a
then we moved up in larger wave b, coming down once more in a wave c, which will complete the purple wave 2, after which we would then start to go up and take that resistance area out that you can see here on the chart in red, between 2136 and 217
it would only be my second scenario if we really come down lower than expected, which means we would then come down, have to come down below 1975
at the moment though, yeah, it could even be even if we are in this scenario and we look at, okay, purple wave two already finished
yeah, we are now in this scenario that we had another impulsive wave up wave one, here we are now in this wave two
one is that, um, we came down here quite strongly, obviously found support and broke that descending trend line to the upside and found our way back into this resistance zone
now it could be on a very small scale that you can, you know, understand this as a bull flag, a small bullish flag
and this is what probably the next hours will bring, for the next hour, maybe already, that will show us, will this level be tested for support, and can we move up from here, a move above the wave b high? that is the important level now, yeah, it's 2186 k
that will, in my opinion, in dismiss any further downside in this scenario, and will lead to rising prices
first of all, if we get above the wave b high, we've broken through the resistance level and we've taken out the wave b high, which usually would suggest that the correction here of wave 2 is indeed over, and we are already in wave 3 to the upside
we broke out of that sort of descending wedge, which generally is a bullish pattern, as i indicated in the last video, um, and it could be that we have already seen here, wave um, wave 2 to the downside
so that is something that we need to be aware of, and that we might already be here in wave 3 to the upside, which should take us here into the other resistance area
so a move above wave b could take us all the way to 23k in in a pretty fast move, in my opinion
it is this resistance area where we are really we've been really struggling with over the weekend
and if we break above it, hold it, then we'll probably move to the next resistance area
and from here, then we need to break out again, that is above 233 k, and we can then move to the target here for the wave three in purple, of which we only are currently here in in the sub waves one, two and three, there will be another four and a five to the upside
okay, so this is what we're looking at at the moment on the bitcoin chart
only really, if we go below the 17 and a half k level again, then obviously we have to go back to the bearish wave count for now, because we can, i'm focusing more on the bullish wave count, first of all, because we have counted the impulse down as complete
my scenario has been fulfilled for this correction, the scenario we've been tracking for pretty much six to seven months
and now we see a first impulse to the upside emerging, which, you know, why not follow it? and, yeah, this is currently where we are
again, not too much movement, but it is definitely worth observing
um, given that we broke out of the wedge to the upside, seem to be holding this here at the moment
i mean, it's coming down quite strongly for now, but you could call this still a bull flag for now
and you know, what sort of the retracement level of this move up will be from the low currently, you know, shouldn't go below, ideally, in this move down, you don't want to ideally go below 2129 k
and in the worst case, not below 212 k, otherwise it will probably be a bit too, uh, coming, comes down too low
you know, all the way up, all the way to the 50 retracement of this move up, is probably rather bullish
but if we go below that, then it probably indicates when we're back in the wedge
anyway, then we're back in the wedge, then we didn't hold support

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
bitcoin hardly moving at all, but we we look a little bit like we could be rolling over a bit here
now, i explained in yesterday's video already what i think is developing here
of course different wave counts as well, but i always try to show you the one or two most likely ones that could evolve
in my view is that we are here in a wave 2, in a subwave at the moment
how does this all work together? well, in my opinion, here, from the low at 17500, we moved up in a wave one here in purple, then came down in the wave 2 in an abc wave
now we are, obviously then in this wave 3 here in purple, that should get to 26 500
that is also the region around about where we currently see here the 50day moving average coming down
so a lot of cryptos are currently, um, struggling with that moving average
but by the time we get that, we probably have come down a bit, um
but within this wave 3, obviously, the wave 3 here in purple has sub waves as well
and it could very well be that we've seen the wave 1 already, we've seen the wave 2, and we oh, we are in this wave 2 in white, and we will very soon enter that wave 3 here
now, in terms of this wave 2, in which we probably still are, that's currently how it's looking like
where are we here? well, so it looks like we came down here in this wave a, then moved up in an overshooting wave b
not really particularly keen and happy about this kind of wave pattern, but, um, i think this is how it's looking like, overshooting wave b
what we could have seen here is a wave one down and the wave two to the upside here
alternatively, it could just develop as some kind of a diagonal pattern
it looks a bit like a, maybe a rare one, which might even be developing here, a bit like an expanded um, expanding diagonal, maybe um here
how you would call it normally? like a descending, broadening wedge
well, we reached that, but i think we will probably find um support a little bit lower, maybe here in the region of around the wave 4 in yellow
so that's sort of the the key one, around twenty thousand eight hundred
and if we go below that, and then probably the wave too low here, around twenty thousand two hundred
but that will be the the next support but i think it will be that would be quite a long wave c
so i think it might really be that we come only a little bit lower here in this um, descending broadening wedge, and then we'll break out here to the upside
um, in addition to that, a descending broadening wedge, sorry, you would normally expect it to go to the upside as well
of course, it's never guaranteed, but, you know, normally, like, in the in 60, 65 to 70 percent of cases, you would expect it to break to the upside
it is, um, generally considered like a descending wedge, yeah, a bullish wave pattern where, um, yeah, you would normally just break out to the upside
but of course, they can go down, and you never really know until the breakout has eventually happened
now we it looks like we see another bearish reaction to that resistance level up here
now, support level here, depending on when it will reach it, is sort of that twenty thousand eight hundred dollar level, maybe even a little bit lower
but overall, after the wave c is complete, now we would expect it to rise to the upsides
break through this resistance area here that we tried to get through yesterday but failed
go through this one here, above 21 700, roughly, and then go into this other target area here, or this resistance area
and if we go through this, it will just get much less likely that this whole arrangement here is still a corrective move, which means we will, we would get down still once more and make a lower low compared to those 17500
that is still possible, and actually still very likely at the moment
but as i said, if we get above that resistance level and hold it, this will be a very important indication that the downtrend may be over for now here
which means the the overall low is already in now if that will become a rally to an alltime high, or if that will only become a rally to maybe 45 to 50k, before we come down once more, that is what the structure will need to show us
it is way too early for that now, but it would indicate that we are on our way to some kind of a rally, to some kind of upside
until then, we are still below key key resistance, absolutely important resistance
and, um, yeah, we could very well bounce off there and still make another lower low
and you could still count this elliot wave pattern here until then with a very high likelihood as a corrective one
um, where we're just doing here wave four, and then come down in a wave five once more
and the weekend um movements, weren't that exciting? and also here the weekly candle close, wasn't that exciting? so that actually confirms that we are here in a bit of a corrective wave
um, and then we are waiting here for the move in a wave three to the upside
so for now, we are coming down, as it seems, a bit um, in this pattern
and the breakout here of this pattern, again, depending on when it happens
let's say it would happen at some point today, then you might be looking at a breakout above here, roughly 21, 230 or something
yeah, it depends because the descending trendline, and it always depends on when such a breakout actually occurs
and that is really what we can talk about for bitcoin at the moment
nevertheless, i think worth mentioning that we are possibly hearing this expanding, uh, diagonal and which is usually a rare pattern, but it happens
and, um, we might finish with this wave down now, that c wave, which is currently happening here
and if we go much lower, or even if we go below the low here of, um, 19 700, then the other alternative would be that this higher level wave 2 was never finished, yeah
and then we'll probably land here in this yellow target, in this yellow target area between hundred 18, nineteen thousand six hundred
and it would just take a little bit more time until that, um, white wave three plays out
or that purple, actually, that purple then would have not not started yet
in that case, we would just still be in this larger a, b, c, and from there, we would then start from that yellow target area
first of all, we look for rising prices here from this pattern
first of all, lower and then rising prices above the high of the wave b, which would be above 21 800

in this episode, we're taking a look at the bitcoin price on the one hourly chart
and we did finally get that rejection here from the 21 500 area
looking for lower here, potentially to the 20 500 range, which we did reach a few hours ago
okay, of this correction, that 20 500, biggest point of control bitcoin and ethereum price exhaustion
i have been trading some bitcoin altcoins such as dogecoin and gmt, just for the bibit competition
if you are new to the channel, make sure to subscribe daily today on bitcoin crypto also do live streams to connect with the community
i am not a financial advisor, so do not buy sell anything that i say
because we did finally get that perfect rejection from this zone, the 21 500 area
it was the value area, high as you can see from the volume traded the last 1520 days
we saw major resistance at the zone, failing to break above this range, getting that consolidation, slightly higher highs on the price action, seeing that exhaustion, and finally confirming, okay, the swing failure, kind of double top here, as you can see, from not breaking the 21 800 range, getting that rejection heavily
and in the telegram group, okay, where i do have a lot of people from the team for the private competition i was talking about, guys, it is very likely that we are going to get rejected at the 21 400, 21 600 range
why this range? because we had the failed attempt, which was this one right over here
okay, the swing failure, wicking above and not managing to continue this uptrend
and if we take a look from this major drop to from the high to the low, okay? from the 26th of june to the 27th of june, we hit to perfection
as you can see, entering some trades right there for that potential leg down to the biggest point of control, which was right over here at 20 500 range
okay, remember, if you are interested in trading bitcoin ethereum, any other altcoins, buybit is my favorite swing trading platform
i have been trading dogecoin, as you can see, i do have a position here on dogecoin at their point zero seven six cents
and i've been trading some all coins, just for the competition
remember, you got an insane bonus down below up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars
you also get 30 days of zero percent maker fee, no fees for 30 days
but there is a possibility that we actually have continuation to the downside, because we've had a massive, massive, big failed attempt in breaking this resistance zone
if we do consolidate in between today and tomorrow, okay, in between twenty thousand three hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred, okay, inside of this zone
okay, maintaining this value area, low level on the vpvr, we could actually go as low as 20 000
i do think there is a possibility that we could potentially come down to retest this low, or even lower, in the coming hours and days
if you are trying to long this position, it is very, very dangerous
you want to see a consolidation in the price, just like we saw right over here for the last couple of days, looking for those shorting opportunities
unless we do get a reaction here, i am not looking for shorting or longing at this level
i will be holding some of my position here just in case we do go lower, totally protected
so now we, we're talking about this also, this scenario, this inverse head and shoulder, but we also talked about, you know, this neckline, breaking above it
we had hardly any volume on this breakout, and we were going sideways, looking for that exhaustion on bitcoin
if you watch my latest live streams and videos, only looking for shorts at this major resistance
or if we did have that leg up, also looking for shorts at this 22 800
and also talked on the telegram group for the competition team
now, what if we do not hold this range? like i said, it is likely that we are potentially going to actually break this resistance neckline, and it's not going to hold
and we're probably going to break through it if we don't manage to consolidate in between today and tomorrow at this level, in between twenty thousand two hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred, approximately
so if we do lose this valley area low, it is likely that we are going to retest this low area from the 22nd of june
now, there is a bunch of liquidity here, which i do think it can be retested, okay, in between today and tomorrow
and if we dip below this range, i am looking for this consolidation, okay, depending on how we drop tomorrow, you know, between today and tomorrow
if we start falling and we do get this consolidation tomorrow at this level, this is going to be a very, very strong level for me for looking for longing opportunities
and you might ask yourself, why? well, we have been talking about this in the past
as you can see, once we broke through, we managed to hold this range as resistance here on a couple of touches
but not only that, this is a major daily level here from december of 2020
and also the end of november, where we do have several daily closes, as you can see, at the end of november, in december of 2020, it's a very, very important consolidation where we did have resistance
so if i zoom here back in on the one hourly and zoom in, we have seen that this level has been very much respected as resistance, not much as support, just a strong falling knife, a little consolidation and continuing back down
as you can see here, this was no level to trade, because we actually falling below this level
so we've got the daily level, we've got some resistance here on the price action
but also, if we do take a look at fibonacci levels, from the low point here on the 18th of june to the high levels, it is also in between 50, okay, and the six one eight
fifty percent is nineteen thousand seven hundred and forty and sixty six one eight is nineteen thousand two hundred and twenty, approximately
so round about that zone, if we do get that reaction, it is going to be looking very interesting for a potential bounce
we've got a lot of confluence at that nineteen thousand four hundred dollar level, plus minus hundred dollars because of the volatility
okay? if we do see the bearish exhaustion at this range in between, you know, today and tomorrow, it might be in two days
this is a major interest zone for me for looking for longing opportunities
okay, plus minus 100, just in case you do get that volatility for that potential leg down, or this scenario also, where we have had the leg down, having insane profits
okay, round about the nineteen thousand four hundred dollar levels
if we were to lose here, the lows of nineteen thousand eight hundred dollars, okay, there is a possibility that you might create a kind of a double bottom if we start seeing some volatility at this range
a little bit of volatility, a little bit of a few bounces, six, one, eight from this major uptrend, then it's going to be looking very interesting for bitcoin to actually continue this uptrend that we have had for the last week

just one second, i'm just gonna, as always, give everyone the content
craig, hello, how are you? we're just gonna wait for everyone to drop in
are you bullish? i'm gonna explain soon what i think will happen
can you put a, can you put call, whatever enter you might on? oh no, i'm not gonna do that
you know, practice it yourself, and you don't have to focus on what i do, right? but i get the idea
um, if you have not already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, because you are helping me to grow the channel
and that is what we're supposed to do, because we can show people an easy way to look at the market
um, so what happened to um, i learned almost every single point where i was weak
so on today's morning's live stream, i spoke about this fibonacci level on bitcoin, and we came exactly down
i haven't bought the market yet because i need some more, i need some more, um, confirmations before i do that
but based, um, based on how, um, the weekly did close, uh, but we did close below 21040
i'm just trying to analyze it now, just to see, because if we take, okay, or whatever, i'm not going to complicate it, whatever
on the lower time frames, now, we did break the resistance trend line
we came back up and retested the higher time at the four hourly fibonacci
uh, the sixty one point eight percent at twenty thousand five hundred and fifty four
on the lower time frames, it's always us very important to look at the lower time frames move and just trying to see how the higher time frames
but we do have pretty volatile, volatile candlestick to the downside
that is the thing like these candlestick, they're so volatile that we just might not retest these levels for the market to pull back up
um, and i'm just basing that of the clothes that we didn't have
like yesterday, we tried to break one of the levels right here on the lower time frames, it's easier for us to see
and we just might only see whatever, whatever is going to happen
and as long as we are still below this resistance trend line, uh, we can pull back up
we will see if the market gives us a retest, looking something like this, and then see the continuation back down
um, if we see the market pull back up and retest this level and break above, everything is about how the candlestick is obviously looking but trying to follow, i'm trying to be more, i try to follow the the higher time frames even more now than i've ever done before
um, because i that is one thing that i noticed when i tried to see how i, how i trade the market
sometimes i'm so focused on the lower time frames that i now fall try to follow the higher time frames candlestick to see exactly, um, how volatile that, uh, candlestick is, right? because the higher time frames is showing us the direction
so if we do have one huge candlestick right here, this was, this was the fake out of this, the previous resistance, right? but i'm not surprised that we actually go down now based on this previous engulfing candle that we did have against the previous lower high on the lower time frame
now, did you comprehend it with me? did you understand? do you understand what i talk about? or how do you see it? but definitely, if we see the market pull back up even higher, that i'm still gonna be bullish at that time
but right now, i'm a little bit when it comes to it hello mckay
i asked you, did you understand what i spoke about? or am i just, you know, ethereum, if we look at it there also one of the most important things, not one of the most important things, but to look and see how dxy have been moving during the day
so it's so many things on the charts, because i do have the key levels too
what we're looking at when it comes to ethereum is that it looks like we can actually, you know, pull back down even more
so i think ethereum, uh, the chart looks better than bitcoin in some way
we can all also take the resistance trend line, looking something like this
on the lower time frames, we take the fibonacci from 1232 back down to 1180, and we're heading back up to our 1206 and one thousand two hundred and twelve um [Music]
so we just might see the market pull back up to only that level
and the the seventy five percent is, oh, it's uh, between the 50 and 61
you know what? i'm actually gonna put an alert if that is happening, because that could be a really great sell opportunity for me, to be honest
but let's see crossing up if the market pulls back up to that level
and i'll because looking at the higher time frames, we do have this head and shoulder
we have the head and shoulder on the on the daily which edge is same as bitcoin
we're doing some back testing while we're looking at these charts
also, guys, i'm trying to dive deep with the analyzes, and it's really good to practice that at the same time, you know
it's always good to write down everything, because the brain will not, well, you think you will understand it
but then, you know, same thing when we were kids, when we were practicing for a test, yeah, i'm gonna remember this, you like, one hour before the test
malcolm, avox usdt, i guess it's going to look kind of the same
yeah, this looks like when we look at avox, the market has already started to, uh, oh, no
didn't we look at this one? so, yeah, this is, we haven't looked at this one for for a while
can you see, if you, i don't know if you've been looking at avax on my previous live streams, but, um, so this fibonacci wasn't, uh, valid
but can you see how perfectly this fibonacci that i took, uh, from the daily chart, i think it must have been from maybe two day to chart
yeah, from the two daily chart, i took this fibonacci fibonacci
let's see how it looks on so so when i, when i back test these guys, um so what i do when i back test it to be more secure about what i look at
and this is definitely i focus on the most of the times, obviously, inside, how the market looks exactly when we come to the 618 and 50
every time i go down to the lower time frames, and i just try to identify what the market does
that is why you can see on the high, and i always tell you about, on the higher time frames fibonacci, the market is always going sideways before it actually drops
yeah, it's the same thing here, like, the market is just going sideways
like, it's so easy to if you don't understand that you are inside a higher timeframes fibonacci, and you want to know, like, what is going on? it's because the market is preparing itself to potentially reverse back down
but what can happen right now? well, it's obviously what you want to know
i mean, yeah, well, i think that it looks pretty good to see the market reverse back down now, right, on the two daily chart
and i can definitely see us, first of all, pull back down to like, 1824 dollars
even if we don't pull back down to 12 point, you know, 47, based on this fibonacci
but the thing is that we actually understand what level we are retesting, right? so, yeah, because on the, on the weekly chart, we have this engulfing candle too, and that is the one that i think about, that we can actually have a bigger, like, push, maybe to the previous resistance
so if that is the case, looking at the two to the daily again, yeah, so it makes sense that we just might drop back down now on avoc to 1876 and 1808
and if we start to see the market, you know, consolidate in between here these fibonacci levels, and slowly, instead of see the market trying to break because if that is, if this, we see the market drop back down to that level
you'll see the market creating lower lows and lower highs until we come back down to it
and then market, slowly, steady, prepares itself to break the resistance trend line and start the the impulsive move to the upside
right? so the market will clearly tell us if these fibonacci levels are valid or not
does that make sense? does that make sense? if you are new to my channel, welcome
and i have morning live streams from monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time, so that is one hour before london station opens
and we actually spoke about these levels in today's morning live stream
so if you weren't that, you understand what i was looking for
i did expect the market to pull back up a little bit, but it didn't
you can also go into my uh, crypto trading for beginners playlist
and if you practice market structure, you will become so good at it, because this is basically how the market is moving, right? so why not understand the basic in the core of trading? i try to explain as simple as possible in these videos
i do these back testing live streams sometimes also, you can go back in time where i dive deep in how exactly to use the fibonacci the way i do it
i'm not telling you that this is exactly how you do it, but this is how i do it, and you can do whatever you want to do with that information
um, so yeah, this is back testing videos that you can definitely take advantage of
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
if you were on my morning live stream, you know exactly what that means
i'm just gonna keep you so you can continue to look at me, and you'll see how good you become, can become in trading and manifesting
what else you guys want me to look at? it's so hot here in sweden, and i am not used to it, and it's really hot in here
you remember when i was complaining about that we never have sun? i will never complain again because it's so hot in sweden
uh, let's see, what else would you look at? avox, i was going, uh, so long i can solana
yeah, so usdt, okay, so solana is also retesting a fibonacci that we did have since before, which we actually did expect the market to reverse back down to
and the sixty one point eight percent fibonacci is at thirty thirty seven point twenty two, twenty seven
um, so we did retest the previous resistance at 4220 on the weekly chart, whenever
so we could have, this makes sense if we drag the fibonacci from 205250
but what is that? okay? i mean, yeah, we came into these fibonacci levels and we did reverse back down, yeah
but the thing is that either we will, um, so what i would look at is to see the same thing here
we already have the resistance trend line, and i'm not going to change the resistance trend line just yet, because if this is a fake out, and this trend line will hold, we will only come back up and retest it
because that is that always happens when the market tries to break a resistance
it comes back up, we test the exact same resistance from that is connected with these two levels
so if we see the market pull back up and retest, that could be the push back down to 3726
but if we break above, uh, the resistance trend line, and we also break above this previous, uh, support, also a high low, a low, at, uh, 3978, that for me, could be that we're actually reversing to the upside again
but the only thing that i have in mind is that, do we have the power to break? because we have, we do have a pretty volatile last candlestick
and we actually have the the pattern the morning how in the morning, the morning house, the morning star, these three candlestick is representing, is it in the evening star or morning start? i don't remember
but it is a bearish reversal pattern that we do have against the fibonacci level
so if we see that the market, if we see that the market respect is 618 percent around 3725, that can actually be where we see the market try
so one thing that if the market now actually breaks to the downside, would look at this previous resistance that we do have
and if we just go back in time, you can also see that this is a previous support
so if if we see the market break below 3719, create a pretty huge break of the structure and the support trendline
that is, for me, a confirmation that, okay, now we're actually bearish
trading is pretty cool, when you think about it, right? i am such a nerd when it comes to trading
my brain is actually working organize the live trading week in sweden in a hotel or similar setup
i don't know how many people we got from sweden here, though, i agree, 100
that's why i'm waiting for another big trade morning start comes up from the bot
i've been, i've been google, i've been google morningstar name, they star so many times because i always forget
and, like, i understand that, but sometimes, you know, i don't remember everything
i was actually in a cell today on nasa, but i closed my position and then the drop came
market has been dropped, dropping for 10 years, it looks like
but eventually the market needs to pull back up a little bit, right? and it kind of looks the same as bitcoin
but it's pretty hard to take a fibonacci for me when i don't, yeah
so this is what we can do by following the trend and taking a fibonacci
so this is where we could potentially see the market, because the market is like a magnet to these levels, right? so now we understand that
and then we go down to the lower time frames and try to figure out if the market is giving us the sign that it's actually pulling back to the upside
so if you know where you think the market will go, we on on the lower time frames
we're looking if the the technical is, you know, i agree with that
it's actually pulling back up to these levels, right? because then we take the trend line, and we will look at where the market did create the last lower high, because that is the downtrend
and we did break the last lower high today on the daily chart, between 78 to 8 and 773
and now, if this will be valid, we can also take a fibonacci from the last high low
is this a higher? yeah, this is a higher low from 739 back up to fibonacci 839
can you see, like, how exactly combined that is, based on the candlestick that i'm using to highlight where the last lower high is
can you see how perfectly this fibonacci level just connected with this? so if we're now on the lower time frames, then see the market
let's see if we're taking the help of the the trend line that is representing downtrend
is a pullback, because we expect the market to pull back to the upside, right? and the market just might now, slowly and steady to prepare itself to take off
my confidence in trading is growing in for the first time, i think it's not a false coincidence
i'm so grateful that i can sit and do this with you, because trust me when i say we repeat this every single day
and i i promise you, you will always learn something new, even if it takes some time
but trust me, you put in the work to it, you will be rewarded
but first it's going to be painful before you get rewarded, because trading makes you go crazy
it was so many times while i was back, testing myself, and i was just completely lost
but i still knew that i actually wanted to do this so much, but i was questioning myself so many times, like, why do people want to do this? because it's so painful, like the greed
like, how does this even work? and there's no one around you that actually wants to do it
and you're like the only one in there, like, looking at you like you're stupid
so what i want to say with that, never stop doing it, because you will be rewarded with not just like understanding a chart, but to understand so many other different things
like it push you to the to the areas in life you don't want to look at
we will just have to wait and see now, because what we're also looking at is a pretty volatile candlestick, right to the downside
um, the only thing that i think about is that we do actually have pretty volatile candles like this is the same thing
like, just because we do have the fibonacci levels, doesn't mean it will actually respect them
but if we see a bigger pullback to the downside, we can, we can actually use the support with the with the brake
if we now see the market pull back up even higher, pull back down even lower, this is definitely something that i would look at
seven point forty eight is some ac level we can, you know, see the market pull back down to for them reverse backup
um, i would want the market, obviously, also for me, to be more confident
i mean, i can definitely take a trade from here if i see a retest of seven point eight to eight
but then if we come back up to the resistance trend line, that could be the drop, right? so with some patients, i mean, and wait for the market to, if we come back up, only retest it
you'll see, the market will give you the confirmation that it will go down back down here now, or break with power, comes back down and retest it, push to the upside
because we overall, potentially expect the market to pull back up to 930
does that make sense? i just want to to see if you understand what i talk about
how are you? is everything okay? how many years have you been in trading or crypto? please tell me
i can trade without leverage or with smaller versions, but when i use levers, i get crazy greedy
oh, so no one asked my question, how long have you been trading? no one's saying anything
well, you obviously know why you suck, because trading is like kind of giving you the exact reason why you're not, just not succeeding, right? just like what is the worst thing when it comes to trading, most of the times, is the leverage, is the risk management, and not the patient
so we know that these things are like the biggest obstacles we have to become profitable traders, risk management, risk management and patient to be honest, those are the things
so you need to question yourself why you're not, why you're not
but that is why i say that trading is so, is so spiritual, because there's so many things that you have to understand why you do certain behaviors
and we, i spoke about this in the beginning of the the live stream
not maybe not till tomorrow, but i definitely think, i definitely think that we will pull back down even more
look at the six hourly chart, okay? we do have one, um, a doji against the level
so if i look at the, sorry, so using the resistance that we do have right here, if we break below it and see a breath test on the lower we can pull back down a little bit more, because the drop that we did have is pretty strong for the market then to from nowhere, reverse back up
but so that was bitcoin looking at ethereum, i just think it's fun to analyze the charts, so i focus a little bit more
oh, yeah, i do expect the market to pull no, we almost did pull back up to that level
yeah, you can you see like we're coming back up to the resistance
i don't think that we will have the power even to come back up to 1212 and pull back down to potentially 1113
but everything, you know, we just have to wait and see, we just have to wait and see if we break above it
i don't think so, but that is also a, you know, confirmation that
what invalidates? do you see another coin taking over bitcoin? no, not right now, to be honest
where did i sell it from? she but you're selling, you're telling the same thing over and over again
but where did i take my tip myself from? okay, i was selling the market from here because i saw this inverted, uh, hammer
i still believe that we can also pull back down because, okay, so overall, so this is my analyze that i have on nasdaq that i did have since before
um, so based on that, we saw we had a support on the weekly chart around one thousand eleven thousand seven hundred and ninety, around the level
so we try to break below that level, but the next candle stick closed above that support
so i that is why i could see the market pull back down, is because usually when the market is breaking inside of the same of the support that we did try to break, the market usually pulls back down to retest that same support one more time before it actually pulls back to higher targets
so this is how i can trade, or actually confirm that it can be the market only pull back down to retest this level based on that
the fake out is always trying to fake us out, right? it looks like we have a breakout retest
but what the market is doing is that, you see, the market fake fakes up from the support
everyone thought the market was supposed to go down, and people saw the market, but if we saw the close above it, we understood that this could potentially now be a fake out
so i'm basing that off if i see that the market pulls back down to these fibonacci levels, because that is combined with the support that i spoke about, that we tried to, you know, break, but we didn't have the power to do that
and that could be the beginning of the market actually pull back up to higher targets, targets um and potentially pull back up to thirteen thousand sixty four, or thirteen thousand four hundred and seventy four could potentially happen
but who knows, right? we're just following, i'm just trying to follow the targets that i have and see if the market connects with it

so if you don't think this about yourself, that you can see on the left corner, i'm implanting this in your brain whether you like it or not
in today's episode, i will show you what we went through on today's morning live stream, if you missed it
but right now, what happened a couple of hours ago was that we tried to break the resistance around 21 360
so what can potentially happen is that we pull back up and retest this level from below
and that could be the push back down to the higher time frames, fibonacci levels around 20 630, for density, the market pull back to the upside
we're trying to break this previous resistance, and what the market is giving us is a beautiful head and shoulder formation
and that could be the push back down to 1 130 key level, and then see the push back up to the higher time frames, fibonacci level at one thousand, three hundred, five hundred and thirty four, then potentially see the market drop again
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly what i see right now on bitcoin on ethereum
so one of the things that i want to share, share with you was the thing that we went through on this morning live stream
and we always do this things to go into forex factory is a website that i use to see the upcoming news that we have on usd
you also have it on other pairs, but i'm focused on usd because, you know, bitcoin against you see, you thinking, blah, blah, you get, you get the real deal
okay, but, uh, so what we can see on tuesday is that tomorrow we don't have anything special
and it just doesn't have to be moved super much during the week
but it's always good to understand, um, it's always good to see where the when the news comes out
and the red boxes means that it can have, i you know, it can affect the market
so, 4 pm tomorrow on tuesday, we also have the fed speaks again around 3 30 pm
so it is also always really good, even though maybe you don't trade the news, but it's always good to have a overview of what's actually happening with the usd during the week
so what happens is, yesterday we we broke the resistance trend line
and i still expect the market to actually bounce back down to these levels
but what we could see on the lower time frames, this was also something that i did speak about on today's live stream, is that if we broke this little resistance trendline that we do have on the 15 minutes chart, because we came back down and we tested key level 21 040, which is a very important level for us to use
so what we can do right now is that we drag a fibonacci from 20 934, so from the low, back to the high at 21 470
and you can see that the market pulled back down to the fibonacci levels at 21 and 200, just a couple of not so long ago
but what i want to do right now is, because, um, one of the things that i that i can think of is this resistance that we did try to break
so the only thing that can, i mean, obviously two things can happen
either we see a break of the resistance, and you see the market creating the higher low against it, and then the market pulls back up
because, as you already know right now, of what what i see on the charts, i do believe that we will pull back up to at least 23 040 right now
but if we now pull back up and retest 21 360, the same, at the same level that i spoke about, we just might see the market retesting it from below, and then see the market pull back down
because we just don't, might not right now have the power to break above this level
so we just might need to pull back down to the fibonacci levels that i've been talking about a couple of days now, around twenty thousand eight hundred and seventy twenty seven, potentially twenty thousand six hundred and fifteen
if i see that the market pulls back up to this previous resistance at 21 360, and we see, because we can also do this if we drag another fibonacci from 21 470 back down to the low that is com that is exactly combined with the resistance
again, a little bit different numbers, but the whole, the main thing is that we see the market pull back up
and if i see that the market now starts to reverse back down, that is, for me, definitely a sign that we need to pull back down, first of all, to these higher low, uh targets on the fibonacci that i do expect the market overall, to come back down to, and then i would buy the market
i'm not, as i said, i'm not in a position at the moment, because i'm waiting for the market to either pull back up, because even if we see the market now retesting this fibonacci, you know, i did the volatility, if we're looking at the candlestick
i mean, you can obviously see one huge candlestick from nowhere just break up, up, right? if that is the case, that's totally fine, because at that point we're just waiting for the market to pull back down
so, you know, 80 of the time when it comes to trading, we just seriously have to wait for the market to, you know, show us the right direction
because, as i said, right now, i'm a little bit unsure, because if i buy the market from here to where we are at the moment, just because we broke this resistance trend line, this doesn't give me actually, a good confirmation
and you can clearly see on the one hourly, the marketing is not giving us clear market structure
because what we can see, we do have the higher loans, right? but we also have the fake out, we have the lower high, so and we have the market coming to the, to the 21 040 level
and we have the previous resistance based on this, uh, this previous lower high that we do have at 21 350, around these levels
you see, you can also see that we technically have a little head and shoulder formation
that is, uh that we can use against this resistance that we're at right now
if you cannot see it, we can also go down to the 12 to hourly charts, because it makes more sense
this is definitely a good sign for us to see the drop, right by just following the market
but that is just the guessing game at the moment, because either we see the market pull back down, i'm sorry for we just might
either we can just pull back down off from nowhere, but i wouldn't be surprised if we see, on the lower time frames, a retest of this resistance, and then see the drop
and of course, we can see the market break above the resistance again around 21 390, for a potential higher low retest, and then, you know, market continues to the upside
so at this point, we're below the resistance, which means that we can continue back down, or we break it, or we break it right? so that is, that is the confirmations that we need on the lower time frames
it makes more sense if we would actually see the market pull back up for a retest and then see the drop
i'm not going to do anything at all, because we are in a sideways market, and either we will break the 21 040 and see the drop back down to the fibonacci levels that i did have, i just took it away
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and if you were on my morning live stream, you know exactly why i have these numbers right here
so you can go back, i will have it linked at the end of this video, so you can go back and see exactly what this means, guys
so we're looking at ethereum, we do have the exact same thing here
i did use this previous resistance around 1230, the market came back down to that level and retested it from below
because, as i said in this uh on this morning light stream, we also spoke about this a couple of days ago
would you have this inverted head and shoulders? the neckline is around 1 30
this is also where the fibonacci is exactly connected with this level
so i definitely believe that we can have it push back down to the to the uh key level and fibonacci level one thousand one hundred and thirty four
as you also can see, this fibonacci is connected with one 1530
so if we see the market uh pull back down to 1130 for a potential high low, the overall target is 1530
and from these levels, if we connect the fibonacci on the lower time frames, we drag the fibonacci from 1860 back down to 999
can you see how perfectly this fibonacci level, 618 percent is exactly combined with the key level 1530? and also the fibonacci where we do expect the market to pull back down from now for a high low, and then see the market reverse back up here
and so, yeah, hopefully this will happen, but if it's not, we're just continuing to, you know, change our mindset with the, with the charts
this doesn't have to happen, but it's definitely high probability
but if we would break below one thousand one hundred and thirty, and see we tested from below, that could take us back down to lower target
so don't we, we're not supposed to get too fixed about the idea of this is actually gonna happen, because if the market reaches these levels, the market will obviously show us if we're pulling to the upside, or if we continue to drop
thank you so much, guys, for looking at this video together with me
hit the notification so you know when i am live, or when i do have my daily updates
this week i will have three videos every single day from monday to friday
i will give you an update of the charts, like with the video and then we will go on a later live stream where we look at the charts together and also do some back testing
because this is very important for us to be able to understand what's actually happening
but as traders, we can actually benefit of the market going down and go up
so this is what my channel is about, to help you guys grow together with me, because i also grow so much when i share my knowledge with you
so don't forget to hit the hit the notification so you know when i am live
and if you want to be part of natalie bitcoin census community, you have it also linked in the description down below the video
so please have in mind, we do have so many scammers out there
me and anyone else from the bitcoin census team will never contact you
just one second, i'm just gonna give everyone the content that i am live
while i'm doing this, you can go in, like the lashing right away
how are you? and i will know, james, of course, we have 15 people on here
we will start with forex factory, just to see what could potentially happen during, uh, this week
do you want to be my moderator? write to me private if you want to
um, we also have around tuesday, usd okay, so tomorrow at 4 00 am
we do have something coming out every single day, uh, this week
uh, but the only the the red flags is, uh, on tuesday, wednesday, thursday and on friday
so during london, around new york session, the middle at the not the end
but yeah, new york sessions, some things will happen, potentially
so what we can do is that we go to, we go to um dxy to see what's actually happening
guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
hello, felipe denis, i'm just gonna go through it, uh, active, hello
i am in my yeah, you can see i do have some some great things in the corner here
so looking at the x, i, uh, looking at the two weekly chart, i i highlight the previous higher high that we did have, around 103665
if we would see that the market now on the on dollars, because we are creating a higher high
we can also take the super uh, the fibonacci, from low to high
and if we would see that the market has more volatility to the downside
now we just, if we don't see the market break above, uh, this previous resistance, potential breakout retails, that could be the continuation to the upside
but i will still use the previous resistance to see, if we only pull back up to this level for a retest, then drop
if we break below 103654, that is the two weekly previous high
so if we break below that level, it's high probability that we will pull back down to fibonacci levels, 103
and from these levels, we just might see the market then reverse back up, or it cannot
if we have more volatility, i would look at this previous report that we did retest from 102200
so bitcoin, if that is the case, as we spoke about, bitcoin will go up
uh, so yesterday on the video that i did uh, send out, um, was this one, a new higher low on bitcoin
and that is the exact same thing that i'll still have, i have it for on the four hour chart
so what i did was that i took it from the last high low, the last push, um, from one thousand nineteen thousand nine hundred and sixty three, back up to the high at two, went one thousand four hundred and eighty seven
and we can see that the market is, and the market did actually, okay, so i was saying the sell positions yesterday, but this fake out took me out, um, but we pulled back down and retested his previous resistance that, uh, that i spoke about on the video, market calls below, retested it, and then you saw the drop back down
i do potentially see the continuation to the drop back down to first about twenty thousand, uh, because one thing that we have to have in mind now though, is that we are retesting the key level 21 040
we can also have the fibonacci from twenty thousand six hundred and forty eight
and that is connected with twenty one thousand and forty so we can go down to the lower time frames and see what's actually happening
um, okay, so what can happen right now is that we can see potential pullback down to, um, either 21 114 or potentially 21 092
i wouldn't, i'm not gonna have a buy limit order around these levels, because we just haven't, it doesn't look safe to me yet
so, but when the market, if the market then breaks the resistance trend line and creates a higher high, because where we're looking at right now is lower lows and lower highs, and we are below the previous lower lower high, created a potential other one
but if we now see the breakup structure and we break above 21 214, that, for me, is confirmation to take another fibonacci
because i know that we retested this one, so that is only giving me the confirmation that from the from potentially the next lower low with the, uh, the higher high, the market will give me another higher low position
but i wouldn't do, i will not have it anymore that right now, because we just might pull back down
see the market try to break the resistance trend line, but then respects the trend line and then continues back down, which means that that's a fake out, right? hello mckayla, i hope, i, i hope, i hope it's good with you
first of all, is to see if i pull back down to these fibonacci levels for a potential retest
but i wait for the market to give me the break of give me the break of the resistance trend line first
if we would see that the market had more um movements to the downside, i will still use the first fibonacci, the first fibonacci that i showed you, in case we have a bigger drop, because we just might see the market also break below key level 21 040
if that is the case, i'm looking at 20, 20, 726, potentially also 20 hundred and forty
and from these levels, i do expect a higher low to be created
and that's what i spoke about on this video, that's the higher low
i'm also going to have one alert if we break above the resistance trend line, in case we don't see the retest and just see the break
either we break the resistance trend line, and if that's the case, i want to see if we actually have momentum to the upside, or if we start to see the market pull back down to the uh, to the fibonacci around 21 096, potentially, if we see more of a volatility to the downside and we break the support around 21 015, if we see a lower high being created against that level, that's the push back down to the higher time frames, fibonacci on the four hourly at twenty thousand seven hundred and twenty, potentially twenty thousand five hundred and fifty or sixty
we can go to ethereum, so we're would you have 102 people on this live stream, 39 people that liked it
please help me to support the channel by liking the live stream, so you can help the algorithm push out even more on youtube, so we can reach out to more people and help this channel grow and reach out to people that need to know the exact same thing that you're sitting here for
and so, yeah, if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that, because i do these morning live streams every single day from monday to friday, at this exact time
and i do also have multiple, multiple updates every single day, monday to friday, monday to sunday
the weekend's a little bit more calm, but that is only because the market is really slow
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
but the good thing with vibe it is that when we hold up positions for a longer time, it's the fees
the market gave us a higher low from one thousand fifty four dollars
market pulled back up, and we broke, but above one thousand one hundred and thirty go down to the lower time frames
and we also have, on the lower time frames, you can see that would you have this, uh, bearish reversal, that bullish reversal pattern, head and shoulders, right? so this is a sign for the market to pull back to the upside
i also showed you this one on yesterday's live stream, uh, yesterday's video, that i do expect, uh, ethereum to pull if we have a bigger momentum to the upside
the target that i can see us pull back up to is 1427 and potentially 1530
this is the higher time frames fibonacci that i took from the last lower high with the connected with the lower low
and that gives me this fibonacci levels if we see a bigger pullback
so what i also do is that i drag the fibonacci from 1046 back up to 1266
and the market gives me the fibonacci levels exactly where the neckline of this bear, this inverted head and shoulder is
so we just might see the mark pull back down to 1056, potentially 1132
that's where i will, um, wait for the market to slowly, instead, it reverse to the upside
so what we can do right now is that we are just highlighting the previous support, that which resistance that we did try to break
now we broke the previous lower law, created another lower low, pulls back up, creates another lower high
so this is, for me, a sign that the beginning for a bigger pullback can happen, back down to these levels, and then slowly and steady, we reverse to the upside
so what we can do now is that, with the help of the trend line, because the trend line is showing us the downtrend, what we also can do drag fibonacci from low to high, from high to low
if i see that ethereum pulls back up to potentially 1217 or 1218, this could be the beginning of and the other impulsive move
in this case, the impulsive move is to the downside, because we can expect the market to pull back down to 1156, potentially 1135
but we have to remember that we understand what type of market we're in
but if we see the market break above the resistance trend line, it just might be that the market is done with the pullback
but do we respect another fibonacci level? okay, so this can also happen
if we would see that the market is uh giving us a bigger pullback to the upside, we can come back up and retest 1232 and 1214, and then and still see the drop
so as long as we're not breaking the previous lower high and create a high high, that could be the push that we do have to the upside
but we just might see the market try to pull back up to these fibonacci levels for then see the continuation of the drop
looking at the daily chart, we do have the so yesterday we did close with a, with a pretty huge, uh, candlestick, and a golfing candle also
and we also have a inverted hammer, you know, a hanging man right here
so, yeah, i mean, i, i could definitely see the market pull back down, but remember, this is only the pullback
if i see the market crossing back up and we are retesting the resistance trend line, and i see that the market will not continue to break above, i will sell the market
and but i will have, i will have my target around these fibonacci levels
because so many people get so caught up with only the rich in money, but they don't understand that wealth comes in so many different forms, and comes in love to yourself comes to love to others, that you feel good, that you're healthy, that you eat good food, everything, everything health rich and healthy
money is a great tool, but if you don't feel good at the inside, doesn't matter how much money you have, you will always be depressed and sad
so that is why i remind myself, and i also want to remind you about it
okay, we're looking at you as 30, as you guys know, i love you, is 30
um, i, i, i usually go pretty, i go through pretty regularly, like certain coins these mornings, because that's what i trade you
if the market, obviously, will still continue to look at this on the monthly chart
if the market closed like this, high probability that the market will continue back down to fail that week
we tested it from below the very, very volatile monthly candlestick
so we're taking other fibonacci from 33 290 back down to 29 900 on the lower time frames
now do i exp where do i expect the mark to pull back down to them? that was not the right one
where's my target? oh yeah, either we just come back down to 29 954, a potential support, and then slowly reverse to the upside
i mean, this can happen, but if we see more momentum to the downside, uh, 28 611
so when it comes to us 30 right now, we are inside the fibonacci, the monthly fibonacci, between 30 316, also 31 470
and this is where we can expect the market to e if we would start to see that the market reverses to the upside
but the thing is that with this monthly candlestick, i mean, yeah, it kind of makes sense
so, yeah, levels where i can expect the market to bounce in between, at least, is around 32 000 and around 29 600, markets making us confused? no, it doesn't
why does it make you confused? if you're confused, you don't know what you look at
every everyone needs to have their own responsibility when it comes to the charts
this doesn't mean it will be correct, but that's what we have to learn to trust ourselves
okay, so looking at the daily now, on us 30, we can definitely pull back up to 31 625, potentially 30 000, 32024
from these levels, i can't expect the market to give me the drop back down because we are in a heavily downtrend
remember, when we are inside the higher time frames fibonacci, that we usually consolidate
so we we could probably see the market push back up one time, consolidate, and then see the drop
but i definitely can see a very, um, very good opportunity for me to go short on the market soon
that's, that is when i start to look at for buy, buy opportunities based on the prices that would you have now, obviously
so if you break below that level, i also want you to start it, to give me a or trading, you give me a notification
so if the market does that, that's when i'm, when i'm gonna start to jump in and look for a potential sell opportunity
shane, how are you? if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
i have my setups for myself right now, so i can go into your, um, your coins now, guys
so let's see, where would you have the first coin? magic for james
i hope he's still here, because magic, it is magic, it is blue
this is a, this is probably a probability that the market will reverse back down from now
okay, i actually want to have, based on the weekly chart, that we did have a pretty huge, we do have an engulfing candle right here, right? so we could definitely see a bigger push to the upside, to potentially zero points, 756, um and hundred and ninety four
if we break this, resist previous support, we can pull back up to potentially zero point eight hundred and fifty eight
i do look for it as a lower high, of course, because you can see how heavily the market is in a downtrend
but on the lower time frames, now we can expect the market to give us a pullback, right? so another thing that we can do is that we're using the previous support that we did also break before as a guideline
if we see the market pulling, uh, breaking above this level, even if we do have a, a, a candlestick
um, okay, so either this will be where you see the rocket pull back to the downside, right? and continues back down
but if we would see so, so for me, to be honest, it's just a waiting game
i wouldn't do anything because i'm a little, i'm a little bit unsure what's actually going to happen
um, if we break above 0587, that could be the push that, for me, is the confirmation that we will push back up to higher time frames, fibonacci levels
and take profit 3 is at where the support is, at zero point seven hundred and eighty eight um
but we also need to remember that would they retest a fifty percent fibonacci levels on the higher time frames also
but if if i would see the market breaking below zero point, five hundred and forty two give me volatility, pretty huge volatility to the downside, could give us a lower high
but when we're looking at the day of previous daily cannot the last week
i mean, we can definitely have one huge bearish candlestick, but i do believe that overall, we need to push back up a little bit more
yeah, just like mckay says, guys, you don't have to call me baby or sweetheart
if you call me baby, sweetie or anything, i will not look at your coins
and if you can't do that, i will, i will not look at your coins
and then you're just gonna look at this live stream and look at it
okay? so looking at the two weekly chart on mana now, same thing here
you know, we came back down to previous supply zone, uh, demand zone, or a previous report also, uh, you saw the market balance from it
we filled this huge wick that i also did expect the market to do, um, not two what so on the weekly chart, the fibonacci levels that i expect, first of all, the market to pull back up to is one point six hundred and twenty, potentially one point, uh, one thousand three hundred and ten
so this is the weekly target that we could potentially pull back up to
so on the lower time frames, what we try to do is to see if the market is actually giving us signs that it will continue back up to these levels
so we're using this previous support connected with the resistance at zero point to nine thousand two hundred
if we see that mana now pulls back down to potentially zero point, nine thousand five hundred forty two, potentially to zero point two nine thousand four hundred and ninety
this could be where the market falls back down to give us a retest, and that could take us back up to higher targets
if that is the case, i would, i would look at one point six hundred and thirty and potentially one point one thousand two hundred and eighty five
and that's where i then potentially can see the market reverse back down from um
but if the mark, if we would see that the fibonacci levels is not valid, and we would during this week, but a break below with zero point nine thousand two hundred and ten, that for me is this is only a fake out from this previous uh support and resistance zone
but as we're looking at the weekly chart, we do have a pretty volatile candlestick that we just might need to um
so what we're looking at when the market is now green, what we're looking at is a pullback to the upside, right? so those are the first uh targets that i look at when it comes to mana and matic
if we would see that the market now have the push back up creates the high high, what i'm gonna do? i just follow the market
with the help of the fibonacci, i take it from the last higher low at twenty one thousand three hundred and third, twenty one thousand one hundred and thirty, connected with that high high
the market will then give me the higher low for me to buy it, because it looks like we can have some, yeah, a moment, yeah, a pullback, bigger pull back to the upside, right? so, yeah, it's just a waiting game, to be honest
looking at us 30, what happens, kind of looks i don't, i don't, i don't like that the market looks so differently on these pairs
ftm, guys, don't forget that you can also receive the best bonus available right now on buy bits up to four thousand four hundred and fifty
dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so if you are, especially if you are a swing you can, you can use it for everything, but swing trading is really good when it comes to a buy bit based on the fees
we go through these pairs every single day, monday to friday, every single morning
this time, um, don't forget to hit the don't forget to subscribe to my channel
a couple of days ago, we had another back testing live stream
we have um, other back testing supply and demand zones, trend lines
if you are new in the begin as our if you're new in the charts and are a little bit confused, look at my market structure part 1 and part 2 videos
this is where i explain exactly how market structure is working in a very simple way
so don't forget to subscribe to the channel, hit the notifications so you know when i'm live or when i do have my daily updates
i'm gonna make you mud right away, and then the girl's gonna help you
and just became a moderator, and mckay, can you, you and lauren, can you help her then later? would be super sweet of you
you know, we came back down to a preview support, came back down to previous support
what i did was that i dragged fibonacci from zero point four thousand three hundred, seven to eight, back down to zero point two thousand two hundred and forty two
so we just might have a push back up to zero point three thousand three hundred, or potentially zero point three thousand five hundred and fortythree
but before i can say that this fibonacci is valid, we're going to use the resistance trend line, because that is the one representing the pullback, right? um
so what can happen now? either we see the market, okay, let's see
we can pull back down to potentially 02 845, or as 2830, for the market to pull back down and give us a high low
if i would want to buy the market, i still need the i still need us to break above 2905 create a high high
and my, my buy position will be at the first high low that we have from the break of structure
does that make sense? because otherwise it's so easy for us to get faked out
so for example, now, if i buy the market around the fibonacci levels here, and, you know, the market would probably, you know, give us, give me some profit
but then when we're coming back to the resistance again, we just might only have a retest
we don't have the power to break above this high, and then market pulls back down again
and then from nowhere, you see this huge momentum to the upside
so i only waiting for the confirmation, the confirmations that the the the break will be valid
and if that is the case, that i find a good buy opportunity above the previous lower high, my target will be the higher time frames fibonacci, where i do then expect the market to drop
i do believe in that 100 i don't even believe, i know it's working, right? um
so i've found this crazy woman that i started to listen to when it comes comes to my, uh, meditation, because i i meditate every single day, and this is so cool
and i found some other people on tik tok, like, people are crazy
and one of the girls spoke about this with manifestation, and she said that you're not supposed to be afraid of uh, speaking about your manifestations, because if you are afraid to talk about it, it's because you're giving other people the power to take that away from you
and based on that, we're kind of our own creator of our own lives
i can talk about whatever i want to, as long as i am 100 sure that everything that i want to manifest can be manifested, because i choose to do that, right? so it doesn't matter if someone tells me you cannot do it, i will never give that power to that person
so what happens is that whatever the energy people takes, uh, takes
i take that energy and then i just reform it, because more, the more energy, the better, right? so that's how we are also good as a community, the better we become each other
we're just supporting each other, and the energy just like, blows up, right? um
and the the crazy thing was that i was like, yeah, i'm gonna try this guy
so what i did on my vivid account now, i i, um, i covered where where the money of the account is, with this much money, five hundred thousand dollars
and while you're looking at this whether you like it or not, you're focusing on that
so you're thinking, oh, even if it looks so bad, but the it says that my account does have five hundred thousand dollars
but i just want you to know why i do have these, uh, this number right here, this is because we're gonna have some fun
by you focusing on this, you're also giving the energy that this is actually true
so it doesn't matter if anyone's like, oh, yeah, that's gonna happen
because we're only taking the the energy, and then we create it to do something our own way
and when, or i have, or i already haven't, when that amount, we're gonna do something fun
every one of us, every one of us will have something with that, because you're helping me with that energy, and we give that energy back
and they also say that money is the easiest way to manifest, because money is, it's so simple to manifest when it comes to money, right? so if anyone wants to make fun of us, let them do that, because they're not gonna be part of that
and that is why i also have all of these things on the side, because you can actually create whatever you want in life
i'm so, i'm so fascinated about so many people talking about this and just talking about how just changing your mindset will change your life, because everything comes from within you
creation is not created by, um, what did they say? so i will quote this woman yesterday
she said that creation doesn't, uh, start with being inspired
which means that whatever you want to do, you'll do it right now
because it doesn't matter how much i inspire you to become a great trader or do what i do, you will be a good creator, uh, sorry, a good trader, when you start to back test it
that is the creation from within you, because i already do this
if you understand what i talk about, and if you're excited by your own future, or your own here
and now, put one one in the chat, guys, because this is, i'm so fascinated that i can even speak to you on a live stream like this
and whatever you want to do, like purehearted will never hurt anyone else
you will never hurt anyone if you follow your own heart, because the heart space is, it's just technically love, right? so you can't harm people with it
people will only harm themselves if they see someone else succeed
but that is only because that's they they lack in that confidence within themselves
and we don't lack that confidence because we are not here to compete with each other
i'm not here to tell you this is gonna happen, or i'm better than you
and i want you to take it and then you create something with your own life
because in the reality that we live, money is what we money is something that a lot of people need, right? and trading is that too
you want to be like you, sleeping golden you want to be you, the best potential
we'll take the fibonacci from 5903 back down to thirty point fifty eight, go down to the lower time frames
we're also retesting the previous support, uh, was that the previous support? um, previous, uh, support and resistance zone
but we can definitely break above it, but we can also only retest it
so we're taking a support trend line to represent the pullback
so this is on the daily now, so it's really, it's a let's see
down to 3833 dollars, potentially 3733 dollars, to go down to the lower time frames
okay, so two things now, either we see the market break below 3960
if that's the case, we can pull back down to 3730, potentially 3828
that is also combined with the support trendline, where a higher low can be created
if that is the case, we can have a push to higher targets, potentially for the 385, around 4740
but if we're not, because we're also using the previous supports that we saw the market break the break from
but you know already what i want the market to do, if this will be a valid, uh, potential valid breakout and retest, i want this to break above 4057 dollars, create high high, pull back down to create the higher low
and that's where i potentially can buy the pullback to the higher time frames, fibonacci levels i spoke about
and around these levels, i do expect the market to reverse back down
so that is the first thing that i look at but if we would close below, if we would close below 396, that could be a sign that we're we're having a bigger pullback to the downside
and potentially, if the market then slowly reverse, exactly the same thing that i look for here
so because if the market pulls back down to these fibonacci levels at 3730, you'll see that market will give you another lower high
so the exact same thing that we're waiting for the market to do right here, break the last lower high to create a high high
the same thing we're looking at when the market, if the market gives us the last lower high around these levels, see the break of structure
and that's the same thing what i do at that time, i take the fibonacci from the last low to the higher high, and that will give me the higher low
the only thing that we're waiting for, and that is why patient is so important, is that we need to let the market break certain levels
because we don't know, actually, if the market will continue back up from this level or not
that is why it's so important for us to understand how to use the tools, where should we come to what happens? why does the market retest this level, etc
for me, i wouldn't be surprised if we have a bigger drop, to be honest
because if the market breaks one level, that's when i go into the charts and look to see, oh, does it do? does it look valid or not? no, no
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that
this week we will have so we will look at the charts so many times together
i'll try to go on live streams two to two times a day and also give you an update
video, um, so morning live streams that we do have right now in a video upload, and then also another, uh, live stream
so three times this week, every single day, i'll try to go on, uh, be with you guys if you, if you want to be part of my community, uh, natalie, uh, bitcoin census community, i will give you the link to the chat so you have it in the chat right now
um, don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars
guys, can you see, look at this, how much money i've got on my account
but don't forget that you can definitely, uh, you you can receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and in this telegram group, we share our thoughts, obviously, together
if you are a beginning, if you are, um, whatever you are, this is a community where we just connect with each other
we just kind of, okay, some good, some people are better than other ones when it comes to trading
but that's when you're here to learn from, right? you want to become better, look at what other people does, and then just, you know, follow that
so you're more than welcome to be on my telegram group, where you can connect, uh, more with me
and, yeah, so i'm gonna end this live stream right now because we, as you guys know, on bitcoin census, we not only do have, uh, youtube, we have a telegram, sorry
we have tick tock, we have twitter, we have instagram, we have facebook
if you learned something new today, and i want you to repeat the things that i have
this is what we are, rich, woman, forever, loving, loving you baby guys
this is gonna be so exciting, because we can change our lives, and we do that together
my name is josh, and over the past one day, we've just seen a weekly candle close, which is bringing these two important moving averages closer together
and the moment they cross that will give us a bottom signal that we have only seen two other times, which were at the bottom of both of the previous other bitcoin bear markets
but right now, bitcoin is experiencing a shortterm pullback alongside ethereum as well, and i'll be talking more about that in just a moment, so definitely stick around
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and today, so far has been a red day, which has also put some slight downwards pressure on crypto prices as well in the shorter term
and it's entirely possible we could be due for some choppy, sideways price action in the stock market based on what we saw roughly around a month ago
because what was happening back then was basically the market was indecisive on what inflation would be, and indecisive on what the fed's decision would be at the next fed meeting
and then as soon as we got that inflation number coming in, because that inflation number was a lot higher than expected, and actually broke into new highs for this year
that was a very bearish signal for the market at that stage, because it told us that inflation was only getting worse and that the fed is likely going to raise interest rates higher than previously expected
and obviously, that did end up happening, with a 75 basis point hike instead of previously what was expected was a 50 basis point hike a few months ago
and so once again, as you can see here, in the one to two weeks leading up to that inflation number getting released, we saw a decent short term bounce back to the upside in the nasdaq 100 index, followed by over a week worth of choppy sign of his price action
and then we saw that inflation number come out and a massive drop because the inflation number was a lot worse than expected
and the next inflation data gets released in a little over two weeks from now
so between now and then, we might not experience too much crazy price action in the stock market, for example, dumps like this or pumps like this, because almost everyone in the investing world, whether it's crypto or not, is looking at what inflation is doing
and so that next inflation number that gets released in a couple weeks from now, will be very important and likely be another point of inflection for markets
and as always, i'll keep you updated in the days leading up to that event and as soon as we get the results
and as you can see just here, we saw a weekly kindle close over the past one day
and last week's candle did end up being a green weekly candle, but obviously it wasn't exactly a massive green weekly candle, because right now, the bitcoin price, technically speaking, is still trading within this area of maximum opportunity, according to bitcoin's entire price history
and of course, this area i'm talking about is in between the 200 week moving average, which is the red line, and the 300 week moving average, which is the blue line
and by the way, the 200 week ma is coming into play at around 22 and a half thousand, approximately, and the 300 week moving average is coming into play at just below 17 000
and historically speaking, apart from what's happening right now, there's only been three other time periods where the bitcoin price has contacted the 200 week moving average
and there's only ever been one other time where the bitcoin price has hit the 300 week moving average, which was during that march 2020 crash
and obviously, during these previous significant bear markets and these previous crashes down towards the 200 and 300 week moving average, those were the areas of maximum opportunity with, technically speaking, the lowest amount of downside risk relative to the amount of upside potential
but if you're taking a look at the price cycle bottom indicator, we're still waiting on this crossover between these two moving averages
because so far throughout bitcoin's entire price history, we've only ever seen these two moving averages cross over just two times, if you're talking about the red line crossing underneath the green line
and both of those crosses happened right at the pretty much exact bitcoin bear market bottom
this happened in the exact same week as the bear market bottom
but the 2014 to 2015 bear markets, we saw this crossover happen just one week before the actual bear market hit its bottom
and once again, if you're looking at these indicators right now, they're getting extremely close to crossing over, but they're not there just yet, which tells us the bitcoin bottom might not be in, but technically speaking, it is extremely close, according to bitcoin's entire price history
and if you want to know more about this indicator, check out my last video on the channel, because in that video just yesterday, i went into more detail about this indicator just here
in fact, in terms of the shortterm price action, we're basically in the same situation right now as what we're in roughly around a month ago
after a significant move to the downside, then we saw a bullish divergence and then a bullish cost in the 12hour bitcoin macd
and what came next was a lot of choppy, sideways price action
and so far, since the bullish dub versions, we've seen a little bit more bullish price action over bearish price action this time rounds
but most likely we're gonna see continued choppy sideways price action of some sorts
because in the immediate shorter term, these price oscillators are beginning to lose some of that short term bullish momentum on this 12hour bitcoin chart
and this is even more evident on a lower time frame, such as the 4hour bitcoin chart
you can clearly see the rsi is beginning to form a shortterm downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows
and we've also just seen a small bearish cost in the 4hour bitcoin macd
now keep in mind, on the 4hour chart, these signals aren't extremely significant, because the larger the time frame, the more significant the signal
but this can still tell us where prices might be heading in the shorter term
and right now you can clearly see we have broken some key support in the somewhat shorter term for bitcoin, which was coming into play at around 213 k
and also, over the past one day, we've seen the bitcoin price on the four hour charts break into new lower lows and also lower highs, which is basically the opposite to what we've seen over the past one week or so, because obviously, over the past one week we've been seeing higher highs and higher lows on the four hour bitcoin chart
but right now this is beginning to change, at least at the time of recording this video
and as for levels of support and resistance, first of all, we still have strong resistance coming into play at around 217 k
and as for support, i'll be looking towards this previous low back here and these previous lows back here, which are coming into play at around twenty thousand dollars per bitcoin, in fact, just below 20k, more specifically
but the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern is the bottom of the wedge, which is coming into play at around 17 and a half thousand, towards 18 000
but just keep in mind, we've seen a couple shortterm patterns form breakouts and haven't really met the price targets as of recent which is why it is important to pay attention to these other areas of support where we could turn around earlier than expected
and now, interestingly enough, even though we've seen a loss in shortterm bullish momentum, and this is now turned into shortterm bearish momentum, if you're looking at this fourhour bitcoin chart, we're still finding support along this previous neckline for this inverse header shoulders pattern, which has technically broken out to the upside
and technically it hasn't fully invalidated just yet, because we haven't broken back below the neckline
but considering the loss in bullish momentum in the shorter term, it's unlikely this is going to fully play out towards the price target
of course, it's possible, but it's becoming less and less likely with less and less bullish momentum in the short term
and by the way, this neckline is coming into play at around 20 500, so that is also a level of support to pay attention to
and obviously, we've just seen a weekly candle close, which actually confirmed last week's candle as our first green weekly candle in about 12 weeks, finally ending that massive streak of 11 consecutive red weekly candles
and breaking records like that just shows you how crazy the market is right now
and this price movement right here is quite literally what a deleveraging event looks like, where we see a lot of debt gets squeezed out of the market, especially in the d5 space, which is why ethereum was so heavily affected
of course, it affected the whole crypto market, but ethereum especially fell harder than bitcoin on this move
but if you zoom into the 12hour ethereum chart, honestly, nothing much has happened over the past few days
we're still seeing these bullish diversions play out, and also that bullish cost in the 12hour ethereum macd
but in the immediate short term, as the 12 hour ethereum rsi has now reset towards the middle of the rsi band, towards those neutral values, we're beginning to lose some of that shortterm bullish momentum
also seen in the histogram within the 12hour ethereum macd, showing a slight decline
and these signals that we're seeing right now in the 12 hour ethereum charts are very similar to what we saw roughly around one month ago, just before a slight pullback in the price of ethereum
but for the most part, we're still experiencing a lot of choppy, sideways price action, which is still what i'm mostly expecting in the coming days, and potentially in the next one to two weeks on this 12hour ethereum chart, before we get that inflation number in a couple weeks from now, where we could experience more volatility when that happens
and if you zoom into the fourhour ethereum chart, we also have a very similar picture right here to the fourhour bitcoin chart
we have a similar rising wedge pattern that has technically broken to the downside with some fourhour candle closes
and personally, i'll be keeping a close eye on this line right here, which was previous support for this rising wedge pattern and should now be acting as new resistance
because if the price of ethereum cannot break back above that level right there, and more importantly, if we do actually revisit that level and get a rejection, that would further confirm a potential break to the downside
and the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern, once again, is towards the bottom of the wedge, which, for ethereum, is coming into play at around 900
but keep in mind, we don't always reach the technical price target based on other areas of support and resistance
for example, we had that previous inverse header shortest pattern that did break out to the upside, gave us a technical price target much higher than what we actually got to but of course, as i covered on this channel days before we got this rejection, i was saying we had a strong resistance between 1250 and up towards 1280
and the ethereum price turned around at pretty much exactly 1280, as i was talking about days before this happened
so that is why it is important to not only pay attention to the price targets, but also pay attention to other levels of support and resistance
and on this four hour ethereum charts, once again, we have resistance coming to play at around 12 30
and anything above that, we still have strong resistance at around 1280
and as for levels of support for ethereum, in the immediate short term, i'll be looking towards around 1170 to 1180, based on this previous low that we formed around two days ago and this previous high that we formed roughly around a week ago
and anything lower than that, i'll be looking towards this previous low that we also formed close to a week ago, coming into play at around 10 40 to 10 50
and once again, back on that weekly ethereum chart, we have strong support at this 382 fibonacci level, which is coming to play at around 1050
and if you want to know how to make profits on these shortterm price movements, even if the price is going down, make sure to check out this video popping up right here, which shows you how to make money in crypto even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed it, and i'll see you all in the next video
i'm going to read the major points of this article before we do move over to the raw data on the onchain metrics
so the bitcoin miners have been forced to tap into their cryptocurrency stashes as the price plunges
rising energy costs and increased competition by into the profit profitability
the number of crane miners ascending to crypto exchanges has been steadily climbing since june the 7th
researchers at macro hive noted in a sign that miners have been increasingly liquidating their cranes on exchanges, several publicly listed bitcoin miners collectively sold more than 100 of their entire output in may as the value of btc usd tumbled 45 and the plummeting profitability of mining forced these miners to increase their selling rate to more than a hundred percent of their output in may
these cons these conditions have worsened in june, meaning that they are likely to be selling even more
now, why does this make sense? well, when we do look at the bitcoin on chain metrics, this is the total hash rate
this is basically how secure the network is, judged on how many people are mining with x amount of computing power
when we look at the past year, when we look at the whole time, really, you can see that it is in a massive parabolic run
but when we switch over to the past 180 days, actually, let's switch over to the past year, you can see the market structure's been very bullish
you've got, you know, lows down here, higher lows, higher lows, higher lows, higher lows, higher lows
i'm not going to read through all of them, but you can see it's been making higher lows and higher highs for a very prolonged period of time
normally you can see this pretty much lines up with the bitcoin price, because the hash rate goes up, and the price subsequently follows
so now we're seeing, in the past 60 days, this started to top out
and when we look at the uh, the yearly structure, you can see these are your lows, higher lows, higher lows, higher lows, higher lows
we are breaking down and making lower lows in the total hash rate, meaning the network is secure, is less secure rather
valuable because the value in the network comes from how many people are using it and how secure it is
thus the more unsecure the network is, then the less the value proposition of bitcoin is
so this is a macro indicator, uh, not necessarily looking too good in the lower time frames
and you can also see the network difficulty, a relatively, a relative measure of how difficult it is to mine a new block on the blockchain
this has been drastically increasing for a very, very long period of time
over the past year, this has been going up, meaning that it cost miners more money to mine the same amount of bitcoin
and the price of electricity is shooting through the roof because of this recession that we're kind of entering in at this moment in time
so when we look at the past couple of network, uh, the network difficulty adjustments, uh, which pan out, you know, every couple of weeks or every month, it's basically gone down, and it's had a relatively, well, it's had a very, very harsh drop compared to what we've seen in previous drops
and ever since we've been in this massive run, we really haven't seen, you know, two backtoback drops, which were absolutely, uh, dramatic
for example, we saw two backtoback drops over here in the network difficulty, uh, when we did have a rather large capitulation
but nonetheless, it this, this is definitely a much, a much nastier drop
you know, we've basically had a massive, massive drop, dead cat bounce
the last time we really saw a huge, huge capitulation like this was in may of 2021
so hopefully the price of electricity goes down, hopefully the network difficulty kind of levels itself out, and subsequently the hash rate can start to pick up
because once again, the value from the bitcoin network comes from its users
the hash rate goes down, this is a leading indicator that the network is less valuable, and it should subsequently be priced at a lower price
the hash rate is very good indicator of how valuable the network is
and while in the higher time frames, i really don't think it's anything to worry about, in the lower time frames, this definitely could be a good indicator that we could be having one last flush to the downside
in today's episode, we're going to be looking at the pi cycle bottom indicator before moving on to some lower term time frame charts and talking about on a range of different charts that we will cover towards the latter half of this video, the new candle body that we have on the weekly time frame, and subsequently, what to expect coming into the price action for this week
before we do jump into this video, i would just like to give a shout out to nakrov over on my discord, because they spotted this first
there's really not too much to this, so we will literally spend a minute, uh, with the cycle bottom indicator
and you can see every single bear cycle that we've got, uh, these didn't load in back into the 2011 bear, so we are subsequently looking at the 2015 bear, we're looking at the 2018 bear, and we're also looking at what could potentially be playing out this market cycle if we do, once again cross
the green line crosses below the red line, and you have the pi cycle bottom if we swatch, if we switch over to the weekly time frame
let's go over to the daily time frame and see, did it call it? did it call the bottom on the exact day? well, the pie cycle bottom flashed
if we switch over to the 2018 bear uh, apologies for the chart going all over the place
whenever i do this in a logarithmic growth curve scale, and then i move back over to the daily, it just freaks out
if we switch over to the daily, now we've got the pain of trying to find where we were in the chart
let's see, did this call the exact bottom in 2018? no, but it called the day after
now, i don't necessarily think this is the one indicator, the endall beall, specifically because, you know, trends are meant to be broken at some point in time
nonetheless, if we do look at the green moving average, which is, once again, the 150 ema, it looks like it's coming down somewhat sharply
since we have been bouncing in the past couple of weeks, or should i say, bouncing, we've more or less just been trending sideways in a crab market
and i think this is going to line up very beautifully for when we do have that final capitulation
if you do watch my channel, you know that i've been talking about, uh, how i've been expecting one final capitulation
my bottom targets are eighteen thousand five hundred, which is not actually where i think the bottom is
uh, the next price target below from there would be sixteen thousand five hundred, where the 300 weakers, and then 14 000
or technically, if we're looking at the candle, body closes 11 600 for the elliott wave theory to remain accurate
now, just quickly, obviously, we've got your one, two, three, four, five, and we are in your a, b, c
so you know, this should not close, uh, below the one wave on the weekly time frame
uh, we really do not need to spend too much time on the pie cycle bottom
it is really as simple as the green line crosses below the red line, and you have your bottoming indicator
uh, like i said, you know, we are pretty much in a crab market right now
i mean, we've been the same price, uh, for a very, very long period of time, apart from this one big flush out to the downside
you can see we are the price that we were on the 14th of june
so how long have we been at this price for? we have now been sitting at this price for, uh, 14 days
nonetheless, this feels like an eternity because crypto traders are used to high levels of volatility, and we've more or less just been crabbing crab and crabbing to the side
what are our momentum indicators saying? because, you know, most of the time, when you are about to have a bearish flip, a lot of the time, the momentum indicator is cool, that you're running out of steam and you're going to roll down before the price action does
you've got this, uh, well, you've got a high, high, lower high, lower high at 23 000
and we've solidified another macro lower high at 21 800, just like i said i believe we would
we came up a hundred and eighty dollars above where i believe we would top
and we basically solidified this double top, rectangular resistance range
so this is now the new price target to be i don't think we'll be heading back over here
there's a lot of indicators, you know, kind of pointing to the fact that we should be breaking down now
there is no volume stepping in on the market at this moment in time
if i bring back the market, you can see switch over to the daily time frame, by the way, this is on bitstamp
uh, and as you can see, volume is just absolutely stagnant right now
uh, it's really not too much uh, balls or bears stepping into the market structure
but what you can see is if we do actually, let me head over to the weekly time frame in a second, and i'll talk about the momentum indicators on this chart
if we look at the squeeze momentum indicator, this is something i pointed out over on my twitter, if you do want to follow me over on twitter, it is at 618 underscore cowboy
if you don't want to remember that, it will be in the description, uh, down below, as well as all of my other socials attached to my youtube
nonetheless, we have the squeeze momentum indicator starting to trickle over into its light red face
i talked about this in yesterday's video, but look at how this market structure works
you know, you've got a massive, massive low down here, and then you've got a higher low, which sounds bullish, but this is bearish for the bearish momentum, because obviously you've got a massive wave of bearish momentum, and then you come back, and you don't have as much of a euphoric move in terms of the bearish price action
so the momentum indicators were cooling, you know, down here at twenty thousand, that the balls are about to step in and take a massive run up
and from twenty thousand we came all the way up to twenty one thousand eight hundred
in terms of the squeezebomb, what we're now doing, we're falling back over to the downside
and just like we had, you know, big run and then a little run, and we had a big run here and a little run here, you can really see this was the apex where the market started shifting bullish
so on that same accord, having this high and this lower high should start shifting us into a more bearish phase, which is actually what i think we're going to be doing
looking at the macd, macd on the four hourly timeframe, this has started to flip bearish
you can actually see this is heading down very, very hard at this moment in time
you can see high, lower, high, lower, high, low, high, lower, low, low, low, low, high, low, low, low, high, low, high, low, high, low, high, lower high
and just like we made a very, very tight range of lower highs over uh, lower highs over here, before we came back down for a big move
i think this is very akin to what we saw where you've in the in the lower time frames
you had a little run up, and you basically just started topping out really, really hard
within this range is basically the exact same fractal as we are seeing right here
you start in the lower time frames making these higher lows, once again, very, very low time frames
you run out of steam, and this is when you take the next massive gallop to the downside
this was also, you can kind of call this something like a rounding top on the obv
you kind of just see the volume running up, and the spikes are getting lower and lower and lower and lower, and you're kind of just rounding off before you fall back down
you've got a high, you didn't even make it back up to that same high
you're slowly, slowly, slowly trickling back down to the downside
and this is what i see happening on the obv, making lower lows and lower highs in the macro time frame
and the rsi, the relative strength index, this also looks like it's losing strength and creating something like a rounding top
to me, we also talked about in my past couple of bitcoin videos, how you've got this ascending wedge, you had a breakdown, you had an ascending, broadening wedge, and then you had a breakdown, you had a rising wedge here
now, the breakdown target of this rising wedge, if we do extrapolate this, would be just where this red line is here, basically
so if we line that up perfectly, uh, we can also see that we've got the, uh, the red line down here
we should mark this as green, because technically this is support until we break below it
but between the ranges of 19 800 and the lows of this rising wedge are around, once again, 19800 to 19700
i mean, this is what a lot of people were getting out of bed for when we were quote unquote having our, you know, five day ball run
all we did, we know, we didn't even come up into the daily emas
we came up into the four hourly emas, got rejected, got a double top
and now you can see, if we zoom in, it's quite hard to see unless we zoom in, but the thicker red line, the really bright red line right here, is your short term moving average
you've got your 21 ema, which is your short term moving average
and your long term moving average, at least in these ema ribbons, is the 55
but i can tell you, if we do come up, which i don't think we will, but it is a potentiality
i mean, it's really not too far if we come up to 21 000 and get a move back down, um, you know it
i guess it looked kind of big when i initially said that i would really wouldn't be too surprised if we came up to 21
i'm trying to predict where we're coming in the macro time frame
i think we've got about another five point five percent drop to the downside in the short term
once we do capitulate below 19700, you're going to see that bitcoin is breaking below its previous alltime high, which is, you know, the top wick of this is coming in at about twenty thousand
the candle body close on the weekly is eighteen thousand eight hundred
so all in all, it can get really, really shaky if we start trickling down another one thousand dollars, even another five hundred dollars would carry enough momentum for your oscillators, your squeeze mom your um, your macd your on balance volume and your rsi to start drastically pulling to the downside
now you can say that we have a red, green, red formation on the japanese candlesticks
i think that as we're in such a very clearcut downtrend right now, it'd make more sense to look at this on the high quality candles
and when we do look at this on the high kanashii candles, you can see what bounce
we didn't have enough momentum to change any of the trend whatsoever
and subsequently, we are currently putting in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
this is our twelfth week in a row where we could potentially be closing bearish if we do not push above halfway between the previous candle body close
uh? this would mean that if we do not move above twenty, three thousand five hundred, which, once again, if i don't think we're gonna have a big break above 21, then i obviously don't think 23 5 is on the table um
but nonetheless, if on the weekly time frame, by sunday, we do not close above 235, we're going to solidify a 12 day bear market, uh? or should i say, 12 day bearish structure, because we're already in a bear market
to, uh, one or two weeks worth of bullish momentum at this point in time
if we look at the japanese candlesticks, we bounced up to this, we have basically two doji candles playing out right now
and i think this makes sense, because, you know, what are we doing right now? we're making a very important decision
we're either going to have a very strong bounce from the previous alltime high, and, you know, a lot of people think this is going to be where the low is
i think we're basically deciding, are we going to come up to the free, to the 200 week, and get back rejected, or are we just going to start heading back down to the downside? i believe that is the indecision in the market right now
i believe a lot of, uh, degenerative retail traders are, you know, heavily hoping to long this
i've been looking at longs recently, and they are holding up very, very nicely
but nonetheless, when i say, you know, degenerative people buying the dip, bear in mind, i myself have been buying the dip on bitcoin
i think this is a beautiful range to buy bitcoin for the long term
i think sixteen thousand, five hundred to fourteen thousand is much more conservative
and with that, if we do get another negative gdp report, then we are going to have backtoback negative gdp reports, which will basically mean we are in a confirmed recession
if we head over to the monthly time frame, look at what the stock market was doing after the confirmed recession in 2008
we absolutely plummeted below all of our macro moving averages
and subsequently, you know, me saying that if we do have a confirmed recession, and me saying that we're at least going to come down 185 for the stock market
i'm telling you, this is very conservative, like a lot of people think, you know, just because we're having a very nasty dip right now, and it's more nasty than previous bitcoin dips
that has to mean that what happened previously has to play out in this market structure
bitcoin did not come into fruition until 2009, 2010, i believe, you know, the white paper and all that was before then
but nonetheless, it did not start trading until after the recession
so what does that mean? bitcoin has never been in the type of environment we are in this moment in time
subsequently saying, you know, look at previous market structures, i think it
i really don't think it would make sense to say, look, this is where we bottomed previously
the fact is, this bear market is very, very different to anything we've seen previously
and once again, this is why i think predicting that 16 700, which is approximately where the 300 week is, is very conservative
i'm starting to lean more over to the one wave impulse on the fibonaccis, which, once again, i'll just draw them out quickly, one, two, three, four, five
and we would currently be residing within that a, b, c correction, which, you know, should lead us anywhere between 14 000 and 11 600 or so
i definitely think 16 700 is the next price target to keep our eyes on
i really just don't believe that we're going to blast off our previous alltime high
you know, we've never even come back and back tested our previous alltime high, let alone capitulate below it
so if that doesn't show you that the uh economy and the market structure is completely different than before, i don't know it will
once again, if we switch over to the uh, to the high quantity candles, you can actually see, because of the relatively stagnant week that we had, well, so because of the relatively okay bounce we had last week, and because we haven't done too much dumping in today's time frame, we're only down 038 percent on the weekly
this is basically why we're just just hanging in there on the high quality for the sp y
if you start to see us move below 384, which is really not far away, i do think we're going to be start starting to head down very, very quickly
and i think that this could even switch red, uh, by tomorrow, by the time the stock market once again reopens
but looking at the regular japanese candlesticks, we've already switched back uh on monday
you know, when was the last time that we did this? you know, dead cat bounce, red candle, another lower, low
where do you think we're gonna go to next? i think we're coming down here
you know, i'm definitely not saying that we're gonna be down here next week
i'm not saying we're gonna be down here in the next two weeks
i think in the next two to three weeks, we'll probably be at 350, which would represent another drop for the sby down 9
i have basically the same assumption on what is gonna be playing out on the nasdaq as i do on the spy
the only reason we additionally look at the nasdaq is because bitcoin is highly correlated to tech stocks
and what better way to look at tech stocks than the nasdaq, which is an index fund of all the tech stocks
so with that being said, weekly time frame is starting to switch back bearish
uh, weekly time frame, once again, just like the spy on the high canadies is just hanging in there because we've had a tiny bit of bullish momentum coming in
you switch over to the monthly timeframe, we're very clearly in a very, very nasty drop
and you can see this the sp y, it's going to take its time, uh, which is kind of a worrying signal
because if the spy takes its time, and it takes, you know, six months or so to come down here, which i don't think it will, i'm just saying, hypothetically, if it takes a prolonged period of time, you know, months and months and months, with the market structure the way that bitcoin is right now, the way it already looks like it's rolling over, just like the sby and the nasdaq does
we all know that bitcoin moves a lot faster than the tech stocks, than the spy, the spx, whatever you're looking at
and subsequently, we could definitely see this move down a lot more
wrapping up the video, once again, looking at bitcoin against the nasdaq
as we did a quick update from yesterday's video, we were calling for this 17 drop
you know, we're down about 15 percent, which is pretty brutal
i mean, for the bitcoin, uh to drop against the nasdaq by 15 in a day, when the nasdaq is already going down almost one percent today, is really not a good sign
we're getting closer and closer to the 300 week and, you know, once again, unfortunately, we don't have data on how bitcoin has traded against tech stocks, the nasdaq, the stock market from back in 2008, when the last financial crisis was why is that? because bitcoin was not trading right then
so, once again, wrapping up the video, to assume that the market cycle is going to play out exactly as it did previously
i don't necessarily think that is the way that we should be looking at this
this is clearly a, you know, this is clearly a shitstorm that we have not seen before
and subsequently, i think keeping our bear market hats on being slightly conservative, waiting for a prolonged period of time, just waiting for the next couple of weeks, maybe the next couple of months, is probably the best thing to do
and this is off topic, but this should definitely tell you now is absolutely not the time to be buying oak cranes
people who listen to me, are now able to buy all cranes for 50, 75 cheaper
you know, even cryptocurrencies like green satoshi token, which i told you not to buy since like five to ten dollars, they're now down here at like 16 cents
so, you know, when i keep on making bearish prediction after bearish prediction, you know, i think it was only yesterday or the day before, we're calling for another 53 drop
so if you are buying old cranes right now, if bitcoin goes down to 16 500, and then we get a recession confirmed, i'm telling you, all cranes are probably gonna drop another 75, maybe 50 percent, depending on what you're holding
you know, in total, looking at the total two i don't think the entirety of the cryptocurrency market would drop that hard
and subsequently, i do believe all cranes are still setting up for the slaughter, like they have been for the past couple of months
all right, everyone, welcome back to the channel for another bitcoin update
we're going to be talking about a range of different macro btc charts
we're going to be looking at how bitcoin is performing on the hike
now, she's talking about the general trend in the stock market, the dollar, the greater markets, and also how bitcoin is performing against other asset classes
this is a two of two in terms of the bitcoin videos i'm going to be uploading today
by time i upload this, there is going to be a short term bitcoin video where i talk about what to expect in the next week
so the first thing i want to talk about is keeping it plain and simple
one of the most important levels that bitcoin has historically always reacted with is this 200 week moving average
and on the weekly time frame, you can see the previous week we dumped almost down to the 200 week
and at this moment in time, we are staring down the barrel of death, getting primed for that next level back to the downside, because we're really not getting the momentum back to the upside that we currently need
this is what i extensively talked about in my video that i will be uploading, or you know, i will have uploaded prior to this
bitcoin video so right off the back, 22 500 is probably going to be a massive, massive level of resistance for bitcoin
and you can see, you know, back here in the 2020 capitulation, the pandemic scare, this is where we had a major, major capitulation down in the 2018 bear market lows, this was also where we found our bottom
so we know, based on previous trends, based on previous data, that we have always, historically, reacted very, very, uh well with the 200 week
and when we do capitulate beneath it, we often get that next leg to the downside, to the 300 week
we even held it very well on most of the weekly time frame in the 2015 bear market
so right off the bat, one of my first price targets is for us to come down to this 200 week moving average before we do, uh, have a big run back to the upside
so this would be meaning bitcoin's probably going to wipe out about another 22 percent of its price
you know, we previously bottomed around about 17 640 on the daily time frame
i think something like another, explain, another expanded flat correction, would be absolutely beautiful, where we trend sideways, start to capitulate into the next month, have our expanded flat bottom
and then we start having a relief rally after we've had on an expanded, flat bottom from the 17 500 drop
so first chart, right off the bat, 22 500, major area resistance
and we're probably going to find ourselves around about the sixteen thousand seven hundred to seventeen thousand range on the three hundred week moving average coming into the next month
if we look at the bitcoin market structure on the hike and archie candles, because, uh, if you don't know why we use high canarchy candles, these are a great way to characterize whether you're in a uptrend or a downtrend
and you can look at this over on the high quantity candles, you can see these beautiful seas of green followed by seas of red, followed by seas of green, seas of red, caesar green and seas of red
so with this particular, uh, chart, what you will actually notice is this smoothens out the data a lot
and instead of having that 10week capitulation with a bounce, we've actually sitting, i believe this is the 12th week
you've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11
so it's actually 11 weeks to the downside that we have currently been residing in
11 weeks coming up, for 77 days that we've been in this mass capitulation over for bitcoin
so, uh, a great reason, a great explanation of why we use these as well as, if we switch over to the japanese candlesticks, you can see a lot of the times you have these fake outs, but you smoothen out the data, and these fake outs are not even here
so one of the major indicators i'll be looking at to help me guide myself through the market, letting myself know, you know, when is this downtrend going to start subsiding is when i finally start to see the weekly high quality candles start to switch back to the upside
because in previous bear markets, you can really tell, you know, if you started buying the dip once after the final capitulation, you know, you would have started buying around about 3750
i would have loved to buy almost the exact bottom down there, at that exact price
uh, back in 2018, i was somewhat more of a noob, and i was buying the dip down to the downside
and in this cycle, if you are a seasoned veteran to my channel, you know that i've been sitting on the sidelines for a very long period of time, and i am currently getting these price targets that i'm dca in
now, unlike the people who've been dca in this, you know, all the way down, we've been getting very, very nice price targets at these levels
i still do think one final capitulation is in play, as we are currently flirting with its previous alltime high
now, if you want to learn more about hiki no she candles, be sure to head over to my channel, click on playlists and head over to the educational series
if i find it for you, if we scroll down, you have this video here, how to hike and ashy candles, and i will explain everything you need to know about high quantities
so on my channel as well, i do provide technical analysis, but one of the major goal posts of my channel is to provide free educational content for everyone who watches
so that being said, you can see we've got 21 educational videos, all completely for free, covering a range of topics from the basics, like what is a security what is a queen versus the token? what's the market cap? what's the fully diluted market cap? all the way down to things like elliott wave theory, which are definitely more complex, uh, than, you know, looking at what is the difference between a queen versus the token? so if we head back to the general market structure outside of bitcoin, because looking at how the stock market's doing, looking at how the dollar is doing, is going to give us a very good indication of what can we currently expect in bitcoin
because, you know, if we look back at these previous cycles, the dollar, you know, or rather, sorry, the spy, had the exact same capitulation that bitcoin did in march of 2020
and once the stock market started waking up, it started leading the rally into bitcoin, and bitcoin subsequently was beginning to move back up to the upside
they've been, um, you know, moving away from each other in the past couple of days or so, uh, but moreover the macro time frames, these play out to the exact tee
for example, if we switch over to japanese candlesticks, um, i've had a few people say, you know, why is the stock market heavily decoupling from bitcoin? but as far as i can tell, you know, we had a bounce on the 23rd of maine
we're having a bounce on this week, and bitcoin had a bounce on the 30th of may
so this shows that the stock market bounced before bitcoin, bitcoin reacted and bounced after
and at this moment in time, the stock market is also having a very healthy bounce on the weekly
and this is exactly what we're seeing over in bitcoin's chart
so the stock market is a leading indicator of what to expect on the bitcoin chart, whether we like it or not
so if we switch back over to the high quantities, we will be able to, you know, distinguish and take away from a lot of these dead cat bounces to lower highs that we have been having in the market structure
and when we do do this, you can very much see smoothing out the data even more smooth if we head over to the monthly, you just really don't have fake outs over on the monthly time frame for the stock market
now, what i would like to say is, if we do remove all the drawings, when we do enter these mass capitulations
you can see capitulation, 200 week capitulation, 200 week capitulation, 300 week capitulation
uh, 200 week below the 300 as well, which was, uh, very, very brutal
you know, all the way back from the 200 and 300 week inception of the stock market back into its first major dumps, uh, into the year 2000, we always come back down to these moving averages time over time, over time
again, in this bit, in the last recession that we had, because in my opinion, we're not in a confirmed recession yet
when we did have that backtoback, negative gdp growth, uh, which obviously is indicative that you are in a recession
so right off the back on the stock market, if we bring up our previous trends, it is very, very conservative to say that we would at least be coming down to the 200 week moving average
so if i, uh, if i draw out some of these lines, if we switch back over to the japanese candlesticks so i can give you an exact price target, let's head over to the weekly, this would still mean that the stock market would be very, very likely to flush out a further 10 percent
and, you know, let's look at what big, uh, what the stock market's been doing for its alltime high
the stock market is down 24 while, i believe bitcoin is sitting at a minus 75 percent, which just shows you, if the stock market comes down another 10 percent, i'm not saying bitcoin is going to come down like, you know, 40 50, but it is probably going to come down to between 16 500 to 14 000
i'll talk about both of those targets again in just one moment's time, uh
but i think a more concert or not conservative, but a more realistic approach to what we're likely to see in the stock market is a move back down to the 300 week, which would be an 185 percent drop for the spy, meaning that we'd probably be getting ready for a big, big flush out on bitcoin, which could lead us down to maybe even these previous highs that we had in the one wave of the elliott wave theory on 14 000
and we'll wrap up the video talking about some of those, uh, less important charts
uh, moving over to the dollar, just like we're doing on the stock market
we're moving over to the high quality to get a very clear indication of what is going on with the trend right now
if we remove the fibonacci right off the bat, if we hide these moving averages, you will notice that we are forming, or we have formed, a beautiful cup and handle pattern on the dollar that's been panning out since march of 2020
you know, we formed this massive cup, we formed this massive handle
if we head over to the daily time frame, switch back over to the japanese candlesticks, i think we had this, i think i had this drawn on the weekly time frame, which is why, uh, it's a bit farfetched over on the daily
we've formed a perfect cup, we formed a perfect handle, and we're now seeing a perfect breakout on the dxy, the us
so right off the bat, drawing our fibonacci from the previous local high up here in the pandemic scare, all the way down to the lows on the dollar, i do think let's head over to the japanese candlestick so we can get the approximate value, rather than the estimated value from the uh
japanese, from the high quantities, because you can see japanese candlesticks, we get the exact measurement, or the approximate measurement
and these are slightly different because they open approximately halfway through the previous candle body
so that being said, the dollar could still take another seven percent move back to the upside
and when was the last time we witnessed, you know, seven percent move like this? well, this seven percent move has been panning out since the seventh of march 2020
so if we go back to what bitcoin's been doing since march of 2020, we were, we were right here, 38 000
so if we do continue with another seven percent move, just like we've been seeing panning out on the dollar
i really think 111 would probably end up being the top for the us
uh, you know, the levels that we're at right now, we haven't been at these levels since 2002
so, you know, that should definitely show you the dollar is in extreme strength right now
if we do come up to 111, this would still be lining up with a lower low for the dollar, which would definitely, you know, say something about the market structure, because the market structure of the dollar in the higher time frames, is in a massive downtrend
and when i say higher time frames, i mean, you know, in time frames probably longer than most people, uh, have been alive that are watching this channel, you know, time frames that are spanning, you know, 22, 25 years so
and with that being said, the dollar looks like it's going to head up to 111
and subsequently, if the dollar is going to move this high, i do think that my price prediction of 16 500 for bitcoin to come down to would be too conservative
because what we are witnessing right now is a, well, it's not confirmed at this moment in time
but if we do have two backtoback, negative gdp reports we've already had one, then we are going to be in a confirmed recession
bitcoin started trading round about 2009 to 2010, even though it doesn't show in this chart
so bitcoin has never witnessed a bear market recession that we are in right now
we've witnessed bear markets, sure, we've had one in 2015, one in 2018
and yeah, i don't really think that you can argue that 2013 or 2011 was a bear market
and in previous pandemic scares, bear markets, we typically come down to the 200 to the 300 weeks
so with that being said, if we are in a recession, it should probably push us down to the next leg down
i'm going to finish off on how bitcoin is performing against tech stocks, uh, you know, on an index scale like the nasdaq
but a couple of other price targets that we can look at in the short term is the next cme gap on the bitcoin cme futures for the chicago mercantile exchange
the last cme gap we had, if we zoom all the way back to december of 2020, we had a very nice gap at thousand four hundred and seventy
so obviously i'm just generalizing the price, uh, but nonetheless, i definitely think this is where bitcoin is very, very likely to head down to next so also, monthly time frame, very, very evident that we are getting absolutely battered right now
you know, this called the top at the first of december around about 55 000 for btc
so the most conservative price target that you could have panning out in the next month, in the next couple of weeks, would be eighteen thousand five hundred
if you do drop below eighteen thousand five hundred, sixteen thousand five hundred to seventeen thousand is where the, uh, three hundred week moving average resides
and also, if we look at the elliott wave theory, i will show you the macro elliott wave theory before i show you the micro
uh, you know, these, these are basically the same, but we're just going to be counting the individual waves between them
if we look at your typical elliott wave theory, put this in a logarithmic growth curve scale
obviously, you had your previous one, two, three, four, five all the way in this bull market
this was actually the b here, abc correction into another five wave impulse
meaning you've got your one wave, two wave, three wave, four wave, five wave
and now we're obviously witnessing another abc correction, just like we have in every bear market, on every elliott wave theory
if you don't know what i'm talking about, if you don't understand elliott wave theory, once again, hyping up the educational playlist
this is why i've got this educational series, to help people who are new to trading and don't understand these i have made a video how to elliott wave theory
everything you need to know, everything you could possibly want to know, is in that video
so with that being said, higher time frames for elliott wave theory to remain valid, which so far it has in every cycle previously
i do have it drawn out on, oh no, i haven't drawn out on a different chart
i looked at previous cycles in this video, uh, or not this one, this one down here, how to elliott wave theory? uh
but that being said, if elliott wave theory does hold true, we will bottom above the one wave at 14 200
which is why approximately 14 000 is my most bearish price target for bitcoin
with that being said, if we look at the lower time frames since we had our abc correction, we're bound to witness, uh, two bearish impulses
these impulses are your, uh, let's see, yeah, i thought, i thought this looked um
so let's, let's, let's draw this back up, because i, i don't know what's what this is
so we have your one, two, three, four, five, and then you come into your a, b, c correction
we would currently be residing within that next one, two, three, four
and subsequently, i still do believe that we are in the five wave
you can even argue, potentially, i don't think you could, no, you definitely couldn't draw it from there
so you could argue, one, two, three, four, i definitely wouldn't call this the, uh, you know, the abc out of her
so subsequently, i do believe that we are in our final capitulation back down to the downside
if we switch back over, switch back over to the macro charts, we should be expecting that in the lower time frames on the daily in this last wave, something like this is playing out, where you've got your one, two, three, four, five, and subsequently higher time frames, this would be calling for the bottom at 14 000
so, uh, that is basically all i've got, apart from, i want to talk about how bitcoin has performed against the nasdaq
why do we look at the nasdaq instead of something like the spy? well, because the nasdaq is an index bucket of other tech stocks, which bitcoin is very highly correlated to
now, when bitcoin into these enters, these bear markets, this looks exactly like, uh, btc against the usd that's because, quite simply, put bitcoin on a logarithmic growth curve scale, and it's obviously exponentially growing to the upside
so with that being saying, uh, with that being said, it really doesn't matter most of the time whether you compare bitcoin to, you know, think apart from tesla, because tesla went on a massive ball run, which is why this is looking so wonky
doesn't matter whether you're comparing it to the stock mark, spy, you know, gold, silver, oil, these all pretty much look the exact same but like i said, the tech stocks on the nasdaq are the most highly correlated to bitcoin, in my opinion
and when we previously have had these pandemic tanks type scares, and bear in mind, you know, looking back at what happened in march in 2020, this is exactly when we started, uh, this macro cup and handle pattern on the dollar
this is basically when we started to get the origins of the recession that we are currently entering in right now
but that being said, if we do look at the previous time this recession was basically starting, we were at the 300 week moving average, which would mean, if bitcoin is going to capitulate further into the confirmed recession that i believe we're going to be have, bitcoin should subsequently drop about another 17 against tech stocks
which sounds pretty bullish, right? you know, that you might think that meaning, you know, the, uh, bitcoins only got 17 more to go
but this is based on the assumption that the nasdaq would also be dropping down to its 300 week which it has done in previous bear cycles
if bitcoin's gonna underperform that by 15, that should mean a 40 drop over on bitcoin
why am i talking about the nasdaq? because the nasdaq previously capitulated below the 300 week moving average in the last recession we had, in 2008
so that being said, there's a lot of indicators right now, a lot higher time frames
look at the high quantities, and you can see the dollar is going up, the stock market is going down, the nasdaq is going down
and the nasdaq looks like it wants to outperform bitcoin slightly, so bitcoin can come down 40
we look at bitcoin on this chart, you can see it's currently flirting with its previous alltime high, underneath the 200 week moving average
this is what we highlighted in this chart as well, which is why we think 17 000 is on the table in the short term
we talked about the cme gap at 18 500, how this is your next price target
in my opinion, we should expect this coming in the next month
i'd say that would give us time for about, i believe, about another two to three months would be another two fomc meetings
yeah, we've definitely got another one before the end of the year
so with that being said, uh, i don't know what this will, i don't know what this is going on over here, because, yeah, this is not, this is not an abc correction
so we're gonna, we're gonna get rid of these, just like we did, uh, before
but these one, two, three, four fives that we're currently witnessing in the c wave is what is currently playing out
so the most bearish price target that we could possibly draw from on bitcoin is 14 000
and as we're getting closer to that next gdp growth report, if we do get that confirmed recession, it is basically going to be the nail in the coffin saying that bitcoin is going to come down to 14k
i think 16 500 is very, very conservative to estimate the bitcoin is going to bottom at
and with that being said, from where we are at this moment in time, i think another 22 drop is very, very likely
we talked about how, uh, if we look at how bitcoin performs against the nasdaq, this should mean that bitcoin is going to come down 40, which would mean a drop down to, uh, 12 800, which would actually put us just below the start of this one wave
this would actually put us at the cat, just above the candle body closes of the one wave, which could still mean the elliott wave theory would be valid on the weekly time frame
at this moment in time, 18 500, i have no doubt in my mind that is going to get smashed out of the water
but the 300 week moving average down here at 16 700, probably coming into about 17 000 in the next couple of weeks
and if it is backtoback negative gdp growth, we are going to be in a confirmed recession
the last time we had this, you saw spy, the stock market, tech stocks, everything, have a massive, oh, this wasn't this was a back here, actually, the 2008 crash
we had a massive capitulation below all of these major moving averages
i'm not necessarily saying we have to play out to the teeth, but once again, i am saying that it would be conservative for bitcoin to come down to the 300 week, which is, once again, 17 000
it wasn't a very exciting weekend, in contrast to the previous weekends, which, in fact, actually were quite exciting
um, but yeah, let's take still a look at the weekly candle close, which is coming up
obviously, what we usually see is still some volatility from, you know, sunday towards monday
um, we are a few hours away from the weekly candle clothes here
and, yeah, normally, in the at least the last few weeks, there was always quite significant price action from sunday to monday
hard to believe it will turn into the red in those few hours overall
um, what we can see in the best case here on the chart, from the low at 17 500, we have created a first impulsive wave up here in purple
all of this here, then is currently part of the wave 3 in purple, which will be somewhere we should based on the fibonacci extension targets, and somewhere around 26 500
that is all based on the elliot wave method, those fibonacci extensions
and what we do, we can just to show you, really you take the low from the wave one to the high of the wave one to the low of the wave two
and here, 26 and a half k would be the target for this wave 3 in purple
so we could even see higher prices, maybe even 28k, or even 31k
now that would be a significant one, if we really get above 31k
and in this wave 3, we might be in the early stages of the sub waves
so, as already said in the previous video, we could count this as a wave one
i've adjusted the wave counts a little bit um to the tour to kind of the diagonal pattern here
for this wave one, you can count it as a one, two, three, a, four and a five
that is how i see it at the moment, that we actually haven't seen this wave 2 yet
it's a bit slow, that whole, you know, what's unfolding here at the moment
therefore, um, i i still think we have maybe another corrective wave to come, especially as it seems to be rolling over here
and so there's two, two possibilities for me that i'm looking at here at the moment, one possibility, and that is, you know, the sort of the closest possibility
primary expectation would be that here, the wave one peaked, and we came down in a wave a
and then that would mean we would come down now in a wave c, which ideally would land below the low of the wave a in an expanded flat pattern
that is just the next most likely pattern that you would then see here
um, and good target for that would be maybe here this way, for low, around twenty thousand eight hundred
possible next target would be here, the wave too, low, at twenty thousand two hundred
would that work in line with fibonacci retracements? let's take a look at that as well
so 20 800 is sort of close here to the um 382 flip level, sort of in the region between the 382 and the 50 level
so at one of these, in one of these areas, i would expect it to land, so either between twenty thousand nine hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred, or around here, 21, 20 140
yeah, this is where the wave c should really end, but i think it might rather be a bit higher
now, this is the sort of the the view that is probably the closest
then if this gets invalidated, and by the way, when would it be invalidated? it would be invalidated if we go below, just think if we go below the low of, uh, 19 77, right now, so 19 800, pretty much
if we go below this low here, yeah, in in a wave 2, then it would be invalidated, because then we just come down too much
then the option would be that actually, this wave 2 was never finished
this is the alternative count that we have made, a huge a, b, c, and actually that wave 2 in purple was never finished
then we would probably get into this yellow target area here, in the region between 188 k and 196 k
but again, until this other structure i just showed you gets invalidated, i'm going to go with that
and, uh, so far, you know, i'm, i'm getting more and more a friend of the view that indeed we might be here in a bit of a preparation for a rally, that the low is already in
now, again, it's too early to confirm it, but we might really see a rally
anyway, that i do expect a rally already that pretty much nobody expects
now, again, a rally doesn't need to mean that it needs to go to alltime highs from here
even if it is something that reaches 70k, that would still be very much in line with a possible recession, because that could just be a corrective rally to the upside, which might then crash down once more
um, so this is all possible, yeah, but i at the moment, i don't see it go much lower
and even if we break below this um low here, 17 500, next support would be 16 900
below then, yeah, below that, then we could really look at the eighty eight point seven percent flip level of i believe it was ten point six k
but really, until we go below the seventeen and a half k level, we can now count this impulsively
and therefore, we just need to be open to the idea that we might see a rally here
for me, it is still, um, absolutely not confirmed yet, because i want to get above this red zone here that i highlighted many times before
until we get above that, said it before as well, there's a huge chance this might still roll over and come down
unfortunately, we are in this sort of in between space, in this turnaround space at the moment um, where all of this could just still be a correction and we come down once more
but the higher we obviously go, the more resistance levels we take out, the more likely it is that we are actually climbing higher here
and when we can finally take this one out, which should happen in a buddhist scenario here, after the wave low, after the low of the wave 2 here, in this wave 3, then it is much more likely that we will see some more upside um, first, probably into the region of 26 and a half, then 31k and then sort of into the region 40 48, um, and so on
so, you know, we're getting there, um, but there is a potential there
and, um, the reason why i focus on this so much is basically, because everybody else is still focusing on lower prices um end
because we can, you know, we can, for the first time in in months, we can count an impulse to the upside
we reached my target area that i formulated six, seven months ago
before any impulse that might have emerged before didn't make any sense because we never fulfilled the higher level requirements to complete this correction
now these are all complete, and therefore the chart has a chance to turn around

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
bitcoin is moving, as already indicated on this chart, in this bullish elliot wave count that i've been focusing on quite a bit
but we still have not yet broken that 21, six hundred eighty dollar level
this elliott wave wave one, first impulse to the upside, which was followed by a wave two, in this count
the however, the critical thing, and all of them don't make a great difference, the critical thing is, now do we make it above this 21 712 level? and then if we've done that, i think we should get fairly quickly to that 23 000 level
because there is just not a lot of resistance in this region here, highlighted by the yellow arrow
it will then be decided, but this is definitely the next target for the bulls on the roadmap here for higher prices
if this level gets broken, then we can also reach this wave 3 target, which is around 26 500
so basically, from the low here of 17 500, we have made this wave 1 impulse to the upside, the wave 2 down, and now we could be in this third wave to the upside
but what i've said to you in previous videos if we get above this 23 330 level, the bearish scenario will just get much, much less likely
okay? um, it is, at the moment, still very much possible that all of this could just be a correction
i had a few comments about, could this be a bear flag? yeah, of course it could be a bear flag
um, in the end, though, a bear flag would normally not come across that impulsive
you know, that's what i've been following through now for a while
and it is now, it we finally arrived at this level, um, and it seems now just now we get above it
but again, this level, if it gets broken and we get a retest of that level as support, the 21 712 dollar level, plus minus a few dollars, then we would probably also get to the next resistance level
and just because i'm focusing here bit a bit on the impulsive move up
doesn't mean this is necessarily my primary expectation, but i've told you many times before, if we get above this resistance level, i will probably make it my primary expectation that we also move higher
that will depend on how we break through it, and if this really comes across, then as an impulsive move up, you know, in the end
you know, waves evolve and waves change, and therefore also the outlook needs to change on basically, yeah, a daily basis
if a wave moves higher than expected, obviously the next target will be adjusted today
so, you know, why it is important, actually, to get, um such an updated outlook on a regular basis, if you're interested in it
why do i focus mainly on the bullish wave count at the moment? well, it's basically because we have reached targets down here
the longerterm target was here, between 20 and 286 k um also, that was reached
yeah, we broke slightly below the 20k level, but not substantially, which means we which recovered that level within a day or a couple of days
the shortterm target, one of the possible targets for this was the 17 500 level, and we turned around
the 17 500 level was one of the possible targets for the absolute low by all means
the market now needs to prove that it's using that potential to push through this resistance level and then move towards the next one, which is here 26 500
so this could just be a corrective wave, absolutely out of which we then come down once more, even lower
and if we lose the swing low here at 17 500, yeah, then the corrective then this here all was just the corrective move, and we indeed come down more impulsively
yeah, there are phases in charts where you just have to see what the market is doing to decide on your next move
so at the moment, i don't have a reason to focus on the bearish count
uh, i have to mention it, but i can pretty much follow the bullish count at the moment, because the the the correction target was reached, the five wave moved down, was completed, and we have turned around, and we see an impulse up
and i told you that above this resistance level, it will probably become my primary expectation that we start to move up, just because it will get much less likely that this here is still a corrective wave
i told you also in the previous video that a lot of people will call this a fake art, probably way into the 30k level, or even 40k level, um which
and in the end, if from here we move only up to 40, 50, maybe even 60k, and then smash down once more, wouldn't that be great? because it means that, you know, money can be made
we can buy, yeah, accumulate, and then at this sort of peak of that, which will then probably just be a corrective, larger wave up, we could sell, yeah, sell high and then buy back even lower
we don't necessarily need to move to massive new automize from here
this is obviously only one scenario that from here we can move to new autumn highs
there are other scenarios possible, but again, it is way too early to look at that first target
now, to really get more clarity around where we are operating here is to move through this key resistance area
honestly, all eyes need to be on this, first of all, this level here, um, which ideally gets retested, yeah, as support
told you that if we go through this zone here, then we can expect the price to move
um, the more important level was this one here, but this here was also an important one, the wave one high
so, um, no, i think actually this one is the more important one here, the wave one high
so we'll see if that price comes down once more for a retest on a lower time frame, maybe here on the 30 or the 15minute chart
um, isn't happening yet, but we see some volume come in, and it's all looking interesting at the moment
so it seems like sunday is getting a bit more interesting after quite a quiet weekend

the only real update here since the last video is that bitcoin is working its way higher
yeah, they were really quite busy, and there was a lot going on
so i don't have a problem with it being a little bit of a quieter weekend
i'm sure the next few days, maybe next week, will already be more busy
let's take a look at what actually happened since the last video
so obviously, bitcoin was working its way up here from the swing low of 17 500 in a potential first impulse, then a first correction down
and then we are starting here, this next impulse in which we might be now
this is definitely a zone through which bitcoin now needs to get, between these two resistance levels, 21 360 and 21 712
and then i think if we look at previous support resistance here, there isn't really much
most trading has happened down here, and it got rejected quite a few times in this zone
so if it makes its way through this, we can expect it to reach this area here, which is located between twenty three thousand and twenty three thousand three hundred and thirty
and if it makes it through here, it can definitely reach higher prices
i believe this will be a very, very important level to get through
and until we really get through this highlighted, uh area here, between that twenty three thousand and twenty three thousand three hundred and thirty level, we still have to assume that we will see lower prices
that risk is still very much there, especially if the price is starting to roll over here, because then it could just mean that this corrective wave 2 was never finished, and that we're just in a larger, a, b, c, correction
if we, i know, f3, it really needs to start going higher now and push through this um resistance here, highlighted in red
now, what happened since the last video? we are indeed slowly making our way higher
yeah, just to make you aware that we are retesting this previous resistance, and that the hourly candle obviously needs to close now that closed
and it was a retest was performed as i mentioned, this is always an important signal to watch out for
they would have waited for the retest here, after breaking of resistance, waiting for the retest, looking for a bullish signal, which is this engulfing candle, and then entering a trade
um, maybe some people will have done it, possibly with a stop loss down here
um, another trade setup idea would be to wait until this wave, one high, is broken
because the problem with this one here, um, is that you have resistance already up here at 21, um, 566, which is really not a long way to go
for me, personally, it would be a bit too risky to enter here
i would want to wait, um, until we get above that level, yeah, and then move higher from there
so basically, also, make make the way through this resistance level, break it, um, retest it, and then move higher from there
and then, you know, there shouldn't be much in the way to reach that 23 000 level
we can also add the um, bpvr onto the chart, and you can see that a lot of the historical volume, obviously, is happening in this area here
um, if we go to the four hour chart, zoom out a little bit more, no, there isn't much
so at the moment, yeah, i think if we make it much higher, and we have now broken the 21 500 level, which is interesting, then we can push through this area here entirely and go to that next resistance box, which is so relevant
now, next level to watch out for is obviously the next swing high, where we were getting rejected again
first level is here, um, where those candles closed at twenty one thousand five hundred
next level is here, where the week ended at twenty one thousand five hundred eighty six
but then really it is this wave one high that needs to be broken at twenty one thousand seven hundred, and, yeah, ten, pretty much
we saw an engulfing candle here, and now our price action seems to be confirming that
bear in mind, we are still below this um ascending trend line, not necessarily a problem, but we failed to get back into this ascending wedge, as you can see here
that's not necessarily a problem, as long as we still make higher highs and higher lows um as per this wave count, we would push higher, obviously, in a wave 3
and this wave 3 here in white, would take us exactly into this red resistance area
this is only a sub wave of the purple wave 3, which would end here somewhere around 26 000, 26 500
it is, generally, on a weekend, lower volume that you usually see
so especially here on this weekend, we haven't seen massive volume
but so what's been going on the last few days wasn't really a lot
therefore, it is also very slowly and really getting higher here
and as soon as certain levels get broken, you would believe that more volume is coming in, because a lot of buyer will, buyers will get interested
i will be, i believe that at the moment, a lot of people are just waiting what is happening in this resistance area, and maybe even this area
yeah, when this one gets broken here, i think this frees up quite a lot of, uh, yeah, a jump to the upside
this area is quite relevant because of these significant, structurally significant swing lows that we have seen here
what we need to be aware of that the uptrend is slowing down a bit
and it really is all about, can we push through this area now and make finally, a higher high compared to the wave one? if we don't, it might just be a corrective wave up here
so in my opinion, all eyes really need to be on this resistance zone, especially the twenty one thousand seven hundred and twelve dollar level
and, um, they're always dynamic, so it's always a bit of a zone anyway
but what you want to see is a price zone broken and then retested from above to get the best possible confirmation

in this episode, we are analyzing the bitcoin price here on the four hourly
we're having small pumps to the upside, but it does look like that the balls are getting exhausted
with this kind of price action to the upside, we need to be extremely cautious because this is an insane resistance level
in today's episode, i'm going to talk about the high probability zones where we could get rejected or could get a balance as support
if you are new to the channel, make sure to subscribe daily today on bitcoin crypto
and i also do live streams to connect with a community, not financial advisor
we've been going slightly to the upside, creating high highs and higher lows
we are not successfully breaking above this major resistance zone that we do have at the 21 600
now we did reach all the way up here at the 21 898, but got rejected here
now we can see the value area high from this trading zone that we have had for the last 10 to 15 days
we need to be extremely, extremely cautious, because we have broken above the highs here, but got fully rejected, and we are getting back down now, as you can see with this price action
we've been talking about this kind of inverse head and shoulder scenario with this descending neckline, okay, having that bullish momentum
we can see a lot of people talking about this scenario right now
now, first of all, what i want to show you is that, you know this, there is a possibility in bitcoin actually rejecting from this level, okay, and actually going to the strongest point of control where we could get a potential bounce
if this happens in the next coming hours, you know, one to two days
we can see that the descending neckline from these lower highs is round about the biggest point of control
we can take the lows here, from this pump all the way up here, the 618 levels
is exactly at the biggest point of control here, which is the twenty thousand five hundred dollar range, where we could see the price action getting a small bounce to the upside, or a big bounce of a continuation to the upside, right? so that is a major, major zone where we could get that potential bounce with all of this confluence in the next coming hours and days
there is also possibility that we might just slice through this range, guys
this level will only be validated, all right, once you have that consolidation and multiple attempts in trying to break down, okay, for that potential big bounce to the upside
because the price action could come down with this huge, nice momentum to the upside, getting exhausted, and then have a big, massive collapse, guys
so we only are interested in actually looking for that balance from this range once we're consolidating
so what is the big, major resistance that we do have above us? the big, major resistance that we do have above us, apart from this one that we are heading right now, we do not have a successful breakup from this valuari high
now, the biggest one for me is round about the 22 500 to 22 800 range
if i zoom out on the chart, okay, you can see this daily close and open
this is a major zone that we need to pay attention and it is also, okay, a major zone here, as you can see, of resistance from the price action from the 13th of june till the 16th of june, okay, creating this big, big, you know, four hourly closes and opens at the zone in between the 22 500 22 800, where, if the price does have some bullish momentum, it is very likely going to get a reaction from this range
and if it does, it is likely to continue correction here to the downside
only if we do get a consolidation, this can potentially get about the biggest point of control from the last volume traded in the last 15 days
but it can also slice through, okay, after this bullish momentum with low volume during the weekend, guys, this is extremely dangerous
while we're going up, we'll with low volume coming from a massive downtrend
okay? there is a probability in the price actually slicing through these support levels, all right, coming from a very, very aggressive downtrend
we can see a lot of people talking about this inverse, head and shoulder
this breakout has been, you know, a complete fail at this moment
we haven't seen any solid, uh candles here on the two hourly, the four hourly to the upside
just sideways, hitting this resistance zone, hitting the last lower high range, not managing to get above this level
so this can be an absolutely fiasco, okay? and then continue down, okay, in the next coming day
these are the most important levels that i can see on the chart
looking at the short term for those potential day small swing trades

you can trade it using bitcoin or other type of cryptos as collateral, and you get seven percent added to your deposit, up to seven thousand dollars
you deposit ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred dollars on top of that
let's jump in here on the chart of ethereum, because ethereum is also hitting a major resistance, very similar price action to bitcoin, having this inverse head and shoulder scenario
okay, where you we can see that we have broken this neckline, and ethereum has had a little bit of better momentum than bitcoin
but what is happening on ethereum here also is that we are hitting the high zone
okay? from this inverse head and shoulder zone, many, many candlesticks here on the four hourly, hitting this big, big resistance
you can see it on the chart, value area, high from the last volume traded the last 15 days
we can see we haven't broken above this zone, so meaning that this could actually get a huge, huge retracement, okay, at least to the biggest point of control zone here, which would be all the way down at the 1130 dollar range and even slightly lower
also, if we take a look at fib level, from this low point on the four hourly to the highs, you know, it would be also the six, one eight, round about the 100, 1, 130
value area here, with point of control, big point of control, where the price of ethereum could get that potential balance, because it is also, okay, the lower high trend line here, okay? from this neckline, low high trend line, as you can see, where it has been respected many times as resistance, this could potentially be very much respected as support, hitting the 618 from this pump
if we do consolidate, then this potentially can get a big, major bounce
also, we need to take a look at ethereum, at bitcoin, sorry, to find out if this can potentially hold for that big, major bounce to the upside
now, like i said, this has had big, major bullish momentum for the last few days
but remember, it is the weekend, and we also have hardly any volume
if the price action goes to the upside, with hardly any volume, guys, this is extremely, extremely dangerous coming from a downtrend, because potentially we are going to see the bears pushing the price back down again
now, also some major levels that i want to talk about here on ethereum
not only this um, a bearish momentum that could happen, and this potential bounce
we've got also this level that can get a big bounce if the price action, like i said, just like with bitcoin, starts dropping
we do not want to catch, okay, falling nice with big onehourly candles, also, four hourly candles, right? going down this major level
only if we create several onehourly candles at this zone, it might mean that we are going to get a potential bounce
now, what if the price of ethereum, okay, which i think is highly unprobable at this moment, if we do not, you know, if we do not get, uh, this big rejection, what if the price of ethereum does get a big, massive pump? well, there is a very, very strong level here at the 1420 range
okay? it's a major daily zone, all right? where i do have this green horizontal line
okay? let me just zoom out on the daily and we can check out where this daily comes from
well, these, this is, was, this was a major low level, all right, in february of 2021
we can see a lot of wicks and several daily closes, all right? and opens at the zone, all right, as you can see, on the 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th
if we zoom in here on the price action of ethereum, we can see we got a perfect bounce from that daily level here
so the price action of ethereum does have that leg to the upside and hits the 1 400 range, okay? plus minus 50 dollars
because of that volatility, we don't usually get a perfect touch, and then a rejection
if we do get that volatility at this 1 400 range, and see the price action that is getting stuck, then we can have a big retracement from this level also, at least to the value area high here, at the 1 250 range
okay, so that is potentially also a major trade that could happen on ethereum, if we were to get that pump in the next coming days
something that i wanted to point out, that i got someone from the community, is that ethereum, also here, is actually creating a kind of an ascending wedge
okay? if we connect these higher lows, i would, let me just get this neckline out of the way, and we can see also the higher highs here created on ethereum
these major resistance levels actually touch this range and got that rejection
we know that an ascending wedge is a bearish pattern, so it gives us, you know, a higher probability in actually getting rejected from this big resistance zone, the resistance of the, uh, higher highs
so possibilities, possibility in ethereum actually coming down, is very, very high
now, what would confirm this breakout from this major ascending wedge would be breaking the last higher low, which is this one right over here, and actually breaking the trend line
okay? so if the price action in the next coming hours, you know, between today and tomorrow, does manage to have that breakdown, it is very, very likely that, if we do get a small pullback, all right, then it will very likely come down to at least the point of control, this level that we have been talking about, the 1110, 1, 130 range, where we could get that reaction on the price action
okay? so there are some potential trades here to be taken in the coming hours if we do see this kind of price action, guys
now, of course, if we do not get a if we do not hold this range, okay, the six, one, eight from the low to the high, which would be around about this level, big point of control
if we do come up and then consolidate here, we will be probably hitting the 618 from this potential drop to have continuation to the downside
we know that the projected move is coming down to retest the low area of this ascending wedge
so this could also be possible, if we see bitcoin extremely bearish stakeholders
make sure to stay safe, have good risk management and happy trading
for this week, make sure to check out the bitcoin census website
in today's episode, i will show you why i'm selling the market from 21 380 and why my take profit is at 20 560
and i do expect the market to pull back down to the fibonacci level where i do have my take profit for then it reverse back to the upside, because this is where i can technically see the market creating the next higher low for them pull back up to higher time frames target
from these levels, we can expect the market to reverse back down
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you why i sell the market back down to the fibonacci levels where the higher low could potentially be created for them, buying the market back up to next key level, 23 040 on bitcoin
so let's start off with showing you that i am right now in a cell position on bitcoin
and this is where i could potentially see the market create a higher low
and then from this level, i want to buy the market if the market gives me the signs that we're actually coming back down to this fibonacci level to see the higher low being created
don't forget that you can also receive the best bonus available right now on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
i do have a short position right now, but the great thing with vibe is that if we want to hold our positions for a longer time, it is the very low fees that we want
so why i'm selling the market at the moment? i still believe the market will have some bigger push to the upside
looking at the weekly charts, i can definitely see us pull back up to 23 040
this is the first level that i that i look at on the daily chart
what we saw the market do was that we came back down to 19 040
we've been talking about these key levels for so long, we're just going to add key level 21 042 on the charts because it didn't, it wasn't there
and we are above the scale of 21 000 and 40 right now on the lower time frames, or, first of all, on the daily charts
what i also use is that i use this previous little support that we did break above and also retested it on the lower time frames
and if we're just adjusting the the support, uh, the support on this level, we we spoke about this inverted head and shoulders that we do have, and that is a bullish reversal pattern
we will change the direction completely, but at least in short term, i do believe that we can have bullish momentum
so, um, that is why i'm i'm looking for the higher low that i will show, that i will show you soon
but why i saw the market from where we are at the moment, is because on the lower time for on the four i will chart, uh, spoke about this one couple of days ago too
what we saw the market do was that we did break the resistance trend line
um, so what we're looking at right now is a break and retest of this previous resistance that, um, before was a resistance, as you can see right here, resistance
around 21st of june, right here, market pull back down, created the inverted head and shoulders right here
and now what we're looking at is was or with, what we did look at was the break of structure
market pool back down, retested resistance trend line, came above the 21 040 key level
and from the higher high, we usually pull back down to create a higher low
and then the market have have the push to the upside to create the next impulsive move
if we go down to the lower time frames now, we can obviously see that we do have some trouble breaking this previous high that we do have around 21 365
so i'm gonna highlight this level, not because i think the market will reverse, but it can definitely have a bigger push to the downside, right? but by trying to follow market structure, what i will do
so what i'm gonna do is that i will take a fibonacci from uh 19966 back up to the high at twenty one thousand four hundred and eighty six
and that gives me the fifteen sixty one percent level around twenty thousand seven hundred and twenty six
and where i do have my take profit, what i do expect the market, obviously now, is to have a bigger pull back to the downside
i can obviously change my take profit based on that if we only have a a small pullback
because, uh, when it comes to back testing, usually what happens is i take the fibonacci from the last highly low, in this case, with the the high high that broke structure, that gives me, usually, a perfect retest up to 50 and 61
and that could be where we see the market potentially create the higher low, and then see the market push back up to potentially 23 040
but, um, we can, we obviously need to see how the market is behaving around 21 042, because that is also a strong key level that we can potentially come back down a retest
remember, previous resistance just might turn into a new support
so if we see that the market pull back down to these levels and hold itself above the key level, that can definitely be where the market reverses
so in that case, i will look at the chart and see, and take myself out of the positions
if we say that the market doesn't have the power to come back down to take profit at or the fibonacci level 618 percent, around 20 564, then see the market pull back to the upside
another thing that we also can use, if we would not from nowhere, see that the market is more bearish than it's bullish
if we do have more momentum to the downside, everything depends on how the candlestick is looking
because if we would start to have a bigger, uh, bearish candlestick, these fibonacci levels will most likely not be valid
if we see the market have huge volatility to the downside, i i will use the previous support that we try to um that, or that we did respect before, around 20 295
because if we see that the market, uh, would close below this level and see rita's from below with bearish reversal patterns
that could definitely be where the market is taking us to lower targets again
so everything depends on how the market is behaving around these levels that i speak about, because the market will always, always give us the clues
and if we start to have, as i said, more volatility to the downside, closing below this resistance trend line that we also did break, that is definitely, for me, a a bearish momentum
but as i told you now, that i'm waiting for the market to pull back down to the fibonacci level, either we see the market created as a higher low, see the market reverse, or if we break below the level, we can also see the market creating a lower high, and that could take us back down to lower targets
and the same thing here we saw the market giving us the inverted head and shoulder
i'm using 1130 as a key level to potentially on this inverted head and shoulders to see if we pull back down
because for me, this is technically the neckline that we have based on this fibonac based on this inverted head and shoulders
remember, now everything is, everything is a a zone, so it can definitely pull back down it
if we're using the fibonacci, uh, from 1047 back up to the high around 1243
fibonacci levels is exactly combined where i potentially can see the neckline being the one that the market will respect for the market to pull back up
if that is the case, take profit one is one thousand two hundred and ninety
take profit two is one thousand nine hundred, one thousand three hundred and ninety
and take profit three could be either the at the the last fibonacci level at one thousand four hundred and eighty, or key level fifty, one thousand five hundred and thirty
but i would also look, obviously, at one thousand three hundred and thirty, key level, to see if the market could potentially create a higher high against this level, to pull back down, create a higher low
and then, if we have the bigger momentum, the next higher high can be at 1530
i'm definitely a bullish short term right now on on both bitcoin and ethereum, obviously, because they're moving at the same direction
and uh, technically, if we're looking at the higher time frames of uh market structure, the last lower high is around 18 back down, and the next low, and the last lower low, is around 993
and you can see how the fibonacci 618 percent, where we could potentially pull back up and retest the 618 percent with combined with fibonac at the key level 15 1530, this could potentially be where we see the lower high being created
but until we reach those levels, the market will give us buy, or give me buy opportunities, until we reach these levels
if we pull back up to 1530, and this is where we could potentially see the weekly lower high being created
that is really good for us, because if that is the case, we, i can have a swing trading positions back down
because if this is the next lower high, the next lower low would break below the previous lower low
and that could take us probably back down to, uh, key level, 730
we just might see the market consolidate in between these levels
just might, you know, freak us out a little bit from 1530, and then slowly, steady break to the downside
so this is definitely the over overview that i do have right now on ethereum
just a bigger pullback on the higher time frames, which means that we are in a bullish momentum on the lower time frames
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
if you did enjoy it, please comment below and tell me what you think
it is monday tomorrow, and you know exactly what's gonna happen
i go on morning live streams every single day from monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time
it is super hot in sweden today, so i will go out and take advantage of this weather
i wish everyone a great weekend we see each other, because i will also gonna live stream later tonight so we can prepare ourselves for the coming week
my name is josh, and right now this indicator on the bitcoin chart is getting very close to flashing another historic bitcoin bottom signal, but it is not there just yet
so i'll be talking about that in just a moment, alongside the shortterm bitcoin and ethereum charts, because we have some new developments showing in the shorter term, which will be important to pay attention to
so definitely stick around to the end of this video so that you don't miss out on any of these important information
just starting off on this weekly bitcoin chart, and we have this indicator just here, which is known as the pi cycle
bottom indicator, pretty much the opposite of the pi cycle top indicator
and i covered the pi cycle top indicator over a year ago, which actually predicted this top at around 65 000
and the pi cycle top also perfectly predicted the 2017 bull market top, the 2013 bull market top
but this indicator, on the other hand, is once again known as the pi cycle bottom indicator
it's made up of two moving averages, like the pi cycle top, but these two moving averages in particular, when we see the red line across, underneath the green line, we see the pi cycle bottom indicator flash this bottom signal
and this signal has pretty much perfectly predicted the bottom of the last two significant bitcoin bear markets, back in 2014 and 2018
in fact, if you zoom into the 2014 bitcoin bear market, which was this bear market right here on screen, as soon as these two moving averages crossed over, we only had one more week to go before we actually bottomed out for the bitcoin bear market at the end of 2014, entering into early 2015
and if you're looking at the 2018 bear market, this also predicted the exact bitcoin bottom
we saw the crossover in these two moving averages, the red line going underneath the green line, once again, on the exact weekly candle where we saw the bottom for the bitcoin bear market at the end of the 2018 bear market
and if you're looking at the present day, these two moving averages are extremely close to crossing over, but they're not there just yet
and what this means for bitcoin is, technically speaking, we still have a little while longer, maybe a few more weeks, maybe around a month, judging on how close these moving averages are, before we start beginning that bottoming out phase, whether we form a significant lower low, or a slight lower low, or even just revisit that initial 17 and a half thousand dollar low
but either way, according to this indicator right here, which has been correct the two other significant bitcoin bear markets, we could still have perhaps a few more weeks before we really bottom out for this bitcoin bear market, based on previous cycles
and if you take a look at this bitcoin chart, this shows a very similar thing between two lines, basically crossing over, that normally cross over at the bottom of the bitcoin bear market
but this chart, on the other hand, these indicators are actually built from bitcoins on chain matrix, but on that other chart with the pi cycle bottom indicator
once again, that indicator is derived from moving averages, and moving averages are derived from the bitcoin price, not bitcoins on chain metrics like this chart is
so what this means is there's actually two completely separate ways to calculate these two charts that i've shared so far in this video
and to get both of these bitcoin charts, this onchain bitcoin chart and that price cycle bottom indicator, have been extremely accurate at predicting previous bear market bottoms, specifically the 2014 bear market bottom and the 2018 bear market bottom
and if you're zooming into the current bitcoin price action around these two onchain metrics right now, these two lines are coming into play at just above 17 000 and just below 17 000, respectively
and once again, we're getting a lot closer to seeing these two lines cross over, which normally happens at the bottom of a bitcoin bear market, according to the last two significant bitcoin bear markets
but it's because these two lines haven't crossed over, at least as of right now, it's suggesting that we might be close to a bitcoin bear market bottom
we could have a little lower to go, according to these two significant charts
if you're taking a look at the 12hour bitcoin chart, technically speaking, we're still seeing this bullish divergence play out, and that bullish cost that we saw a while ago in the bitcoin macd on the 12hour timeframe still play out as well with this shortterm bullish momentum
but when you're zooming in even further into the fourhour bitcoin chart, this, on the other hand, actually shows this shortterm bullish momentum is slowly beginning to fade away
if you're looking at the rsi and the macd on the 4hour charts, we're starting to see the fourhour bitcoin rsi flatten out and actually form horizontal highs, while the bitcoin price formed higher highs
and technically speaking, that is a form of bearish divergence, but it is weaker than a regular bearish divergence because we do not have lower highs in the 4 hour bitcoin rsi, at least as of right now
but if you're looking at the histogram within the macd indicator, this histogram is slowly declining, while the price action is slowly climbing
and if you're looking at the last time that happens, that was around the 20th to 21st of june
as you can see, the histogram in the fourhour bitcoin macd was beginning to decline right around here, as the bitcoin price was still slowly rising
but this was showing a loss in that shortterm bullish momentum
and what came next was simply a shortterm pullback that lasted for around one to two days
so with that in mind, it is entirely possible we could be due for some sort of shortterm pullback, potentially in the coming days, especially if we see a continued rejection from around 217 k, which is acting as major resistance
and obviously, we do have a rising wedge pattern on the fourhour bitcoin chart, which is typically a bearish pattern, which means, more often than not, it does end up breaking to the downside
and right now, at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is making an attempt of breaking to the downside, but we don't have a lot of confirmation
we have one four hour candle close, but if you want to see even more confirmation, what i'll be looking out for is a potential break of these previous lows coming into play at around 208 k
and other than that, i'll be looking at spikes in volume as we're breaking to the downside, below those significant levels in the short term, and also a possible retest of around 216 to 217 k
if we break into new higher highs, and the rsi also makes higher highs, then that would essentially invalidate this break to the downside
so basically, to sum up this for our bitcoin chart, we don't currently have a lot of confirmation or a lot of momentum to really either direction
the rsi, once again, is pretty flat, and the macd is declining
so when it comes to this four hour bitcoin chart in particular, i'd like to see the price actually mature, to actually see some more confirmation coming in
and while we're looking at the four hour bitcoin chart, taking a look at this four hour bitcoin chance which, of course, shows that inverse head of tortoise pattern, which has already confirmed a breakout to the upside with a successful retest
so technically speaking, this pattern right here does have more confirmation for the breakout to the upside than this pattern has for the break to the downside
which means, technically speaking, in that somewhat shorter term, we're slightly more bullish than bearish
but like i said in the price oscillators, we're losing some of that shortterm bullish momentum, which is mostly why we're seeing a lot of sideways price action in the somewhat shorter term
but i'll be paying close attention to this neckline for the inverse handed shoulders pattern, which is currently coming into play at around 20 700, which is, once again, very close to that 208k level that i just mentioned
because basically, if we break back below that level, we'll be setting in some new lower lows in the immediate shortterm price action
and also, seeing a confirmed break back below the neckline would invalidate the inverse tender shoulders pattern altogether, leaving only the bearish rising watch pattern remaining
so once again, even though we are lacking in bullish momentum in the shorter term, we have not seen the bearish scenario fully confirmed, at least as of right now, in the somewhat shorter term for bitcoin
and if you want to know my bitcoin price targets based on the patterns that i've just mentioned, check out some of my recent videos that i've posted over the past few days
because in those videos i shared my bitcoin price targets for these patterns
and obviously, things are very similar for ethereum against the us
especially right here on the 12hour ethereum chart, we're still seeing reduced bearish momentum after that bullish divergence and that bullish cost in the 12hour bitcoin macd and if you zoom in even further into the four hour ethereum to yours dollar chart, technically speaking, as of recording this video, the shortterm trend for ethereum on this fourhour time frame is a bullish trend because we're making higher lows and higher highs
of course, the larger trend on the daily or the weekly chart, for example, is obviously still a bearish trend
but even though this bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern is technically still in play, and we're technically still in that shortterm bullish trend that has not been broken as of right now, we are showing signs of losing some of that shortterm bullish momentum, as seen on this chart, especially in the price oscillators
the rsi, for example, has actually formed slightly lower highs, while the price action has formed higher highs
and this is even more visible on slightly lower time frames like the twohour bitcoin chart, revealing a shortterm bearish divergence for ethereum against the us
and we're also seeing a decline in the histogram within the fourhour ethereum macd as the macd indicator itself is approaching a shortterm bearish cross like what we saw back here during this shortterm correction for ethereum, which is revealing we could be due for some sort of shortterm pullback for ethereum within the next few days or so, based on the price oscillators alone
but once again, even though we do have signs of that shortterm bullish momentum beginning to fade away, we haven't confirmed the bearish scenario
for example, we have a level coming in at around 12 k, which we need to hold above, because if ethereum confirms a break back below 12 k, specifically this previous low coming in at around 1 180, then that would confirm the shortterm bearish scenario, which would basically be a shortterm pullback, at least over the next one to two days, like what we saw back here
but the technical price target for this rising wedge pattern is even lower than that previous low, which is sitting at around 1050
and once again, if you want to know the price target for this pattern, check out my recent videos on the channel over the past few days
and as for levels of resistance to pay attention to, we do have significant shortterm resistance for ethereum coming into play at around 12701280

i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
all right, everyone, welcome back to the channel for another bitcoin update
in today's episode, we're going to be talking about bitcoin momentum indicators
this is going to be one out of two bitcoin videos that i am going to upload today
i'm going to keep these separate because in this video we're going to be looking at a range of oscillators, a range of momentum indicators, and we're going to be talking about what is currently playing out in the markets
and in the video i'm uploading after this, we're going to be talking about the macro market structure
now, in the previous video that i made yesterday, we were talking about a range of indicators, most of them bearish, one of them bullish
what you can see how we had this drawn yesterday is we had a high up here, and as of the time of recording yesterday, this was the chart setup that we were playing at
but what you can actually see is we didn't follow with the typical trend of coming up and making another lower high
what we've done is this was the high we talked about this level yesterday, 21 700 on the hourly time frame
if we zoom out, you can see what we actually did moving this down to the close, is we pumped above it
on the one hourly candle, we got shot right back down to the downside
and just where this resistance was at twenty one thousand seven hundred, we had an hourly body close over at twenty one thousand seven hundred, and as you can see, we got clotted back down to the downside
if we zoom out, you can see we are absolutely miles away from bitcoin's bull market support bands
if we do zoom in, you can also see that we do have, uh, some hidden bullish divergence playing out right now
you can see the strength of the money flow indicator is moving to the downside while the price is moving up
however, with everything else that is going on the chart that i will be talking about in a moment, i do think there's more bearish indicators over in the market than there are bullish if we look at the high quantity candles and get a good gauge on what the momentum is saying, you can still see we are slightly hanging in there as we are moving up to the top side of this triangle
we are tipping over to the downside on the four hourly time frame
and we do have a tiny bit of bearish volume starting to step in
uh, what i would say about this volume is, though, that we are seeing some indicators that we're bullish
like we had the inverse head and shoulders over here, we broke above it
and in my opinion, because, like i said, you know, i do like to highlight these bullish signals, even if i don't think they're going to play out
i like to be as unbiased as possible, you know, my perspective, i don't think the bottoms in
i think we've got another leg to the downside before the bottoms in
but we did temporarily break to the upside of this inverse head and shoulders
we came back, you know, we had many four hourly back tests of it, and it seems like we're coming up and aiming back down
but you can also see, which is one of the indicators i talked about yesterday, is that we did have a potential bullish dime, half diamond reversal pattern
and once again, this was another one that i said i do not think will be playing out to the upside
and what do we do? we ran right to the upside of the resistance
we came right back down to retest the support, and bang, we got shot right beneath it
and we have temporarily, at least broken to the downside of this uptrend
now, if you are a veteran to my channel, you really do know that i'm not the biggest fan of support lions trend lines in the first place
i prefer to look at fibonaccis, oscillators, moving averages, uh, all of that good stuff
so is it the end of the world that we have broken? uh, belief beneath this trendline? not really
but i still do think with everything else we're going to talk about, this is going to push us down
we're starting to head back down, so we're going to remove this
in the higher time frames, we've once again solidified a slightly, uh, slightly higher, but nonetheless still a lower high
so if we talk about this chart in terms of the oscillators that we've got going on, uh, as you can see, the squeeze one on the four hourly time frame has started to push back down to the downside
the last time this happened, we did have a fairly decent size capitulation
bear in mind, we did manage to make higher, higher highs with this one
in the lower time frames, of course, you know, we came back down another 76 and this has just started kicking in since we were at the top of this candle
so if we do move down about another 76 percent, this is going to pull us down to the 19800 range, which you may recognize as bitcoins previous alltime high
so if we do fall below that range, i do believe a lot of panic will ensue and the markets will start to capitulate
but as you can see, the macd is currently very overbought on the fourhour time frame
and when you do zoom out, you can see you've got a high up here
you've got a lower high, and now you've solidified enough, another lower high in the macd
every time you do poke above this overbought region, you have a big, big flush to the downside
i mean, if i zoom out, you can see, from here, 31 500, we moved all the way down until we had a poke back up to 31 600, another flush back down to the downside
and now, when we are topping out in this um, in this bullet on, in this bullish flip that we did have of the macd, which is now flipping bearish, just like it did over here
and just like it did over here, you can very much see, uh, it's, it's not really a good sign once the macd tops out overbought and then starts colliding to the downside
you know, i'm not, i'm definitely not saying that we're gonna move down
i'm not saying that we're gonna have any type of move, uh, as big as that
in fact, i would really, be, uh, really assuming that we'd probably be coming down, maybe having one last bounce at the lows before coming down to between 16 500 and maybe 16 if we do get that bearish, that is kind of where, uh, i at least perceive that the bottom would be
and now, quickly drawing our fibonaccis before we do move over
on this chart, you can still see in the very, very lower time frames we are hanging in there, but, you know, there is no volume confirming any of the breakouts that we were having
and when we do look at the inverse head and shoulders, when you do have this breakout, when you do have the back test and you start rolling down, this is the time where you want to see volume coming in to confirm the breakout
you want to see a strong back test and a push back up to new hires
and this just looks like, you know, balls maybe got a tiny bit exuberant
the double top is also seen over in the total crypto market cap
and it looks like this could have also been another potential inverse head and shoulders that could have been playing out
so if we do start to capitulate on the total crypto market cap, really not too much
about another 16 billion to the downside, this would only represent about another 15 percent drop
if you do have that drop, you're going to start invalidating these bullish structures that we have, like the inverse head and shoulders on bitcoin and the inverse head and shoulders on the total crypto market cap
both of these, though you can see lower time frames for bitcoin, you have solidified a double top formation
on the total crypto market cap, you have also solidified this double top formation total crypto market cap as well
looking at the momentum indicators, basically the same as bitcoin, you have the macd flipping bearish after being overbought
and you've got the squeeze mom flipping back to the downside after the bulls have had a very, very flat and weak trend to the upside
the squeeze one was slightly more exuberant because a lot of the oak cranes went on half decent rallies
but now, because of that, we're probably gonna see a hefty leg to the downside
the macd was overbought as well, and now this is heading down
you can also see, when we do zoom out, you've got, yeah, this is really not good
you've got a lower high on the macd, another lower high, another low high and another lower high
but when these are coming to the downside, they're still pretty hefty
and in fact, you know, depending on where you draw them from, you can also say that we are slightly decreasing
but drawing from these you can, you can also see that we are increasing
so i would definitely say momentum on the total crypto market cap and bitcrane is very, very bearish right now
if we look at the obv, which is the on balance volume as well, you can just kind of see, i mean, on some of the charts, we have made slight higher highs, or we've tried to come up and double top
and it looks like we're probably now going to come out and take out the lows, and probably have something like this, where we come down to lower levels
we talked about the macd on the total crypto market cap, is heading to the downside
very indicative that you have made that lower high, and you're now pushing back to the downside
just like when we were here at the bottom, and we had a huge bearish move down on the 14th of june
we came back, reset momentum, had another bearish move on the 19th
because of that lower high, what did the total crypto market cap do when we solidified this lower high? if i can pull it back up, we basically, this was right here, right at the bottom
and because of that, we had a massive move to the upside, because we were making that, uh, lower high, or at least, you know, to the upside
i mean, technically this would be a higher low, but this is in terms of the bearish momentum back
when we come up to the upside, i imagine this is going to have the same effect
i feel like the next capitulation is going to be very, very hefty
and that's basically what i'm thinking for the uh, for the macd as well
just like i said, you know, we're basically just forming lower high after lower high, after low high after lower high
and i really do think we're getting ready for that next major move to the downside
if bitcoin was going to break even short term bullish, it would need to poke its head back above 21 700
if it does not do that, then, you know, once again, nothing has changed
and it does seem like a lot of these indicators, especially this half diamond potential, half diamond reversal pattern, as i always say on my channel, a failed move equals a fast move in the opposite direction
what does that mean? well, we just have to look at the chart, and we can tell very easily what this means
you had a failed move in a one hourly candle, you came back for the back test, this is where you would have wanted to start to head back up
if this was not a failed move, what did we do instead? we back tested it, and now we are very, very quickly heading back down to the downside
so once we retested this, 21 480, we're currently residing about 21 200 right now we've come down to 21 100
and i think it's probably about the time that we start pushing back down to the downside
if we lose 20 700 to 28 to 20 800, we are going to absolutely landslide
what happens when you have a temporary fake out above the 13 ema, and a couple days later, you come back for the back test
what are we doing right now? in the lower time frames? we've poked our head above it, we've come back for the back test, we've come up basically made a double top structure, and we're kind of aiming down below this right now
so once again, this is going to curve out to around about twenty thousand eight hundred
you know, if we come back here in the next four hours, then twenty thousand eight hundred
if we take another day or so, it might be more around the regions of twenty thousand six hundred
so the only other thing that i want to talk about is the rsi, and we'll also pull up the bull market support ban so while we're here, let's clear up this chart a bit
on the four hourly time frame, we are once again coming into the ema ribbons
and if we do break below the four hourly emas you've also got right here, 20 800, this is where the 13 ema is going to be
so if you do capitulate below here, and then take out the uh, 13day ema at 2000 uh, or, sorry, 20 700, like like you can see here, we would be failing the inverse head and shoulders
uh, we would be breaking down from our micro uptrend over on this chart here
we've more or less just been trending sideways and forming, you know, high, low or high
and it looks like now is the time, uh, to end the crab market and to enter another bearish capitulation to the downside
so, four hourly ema ribbons were beneath them, uh, daily ema ribbons, you're miles away from them
and the daily time frame has, once again, looks like it made another lower high
it looks like it's having a rounding top and wants to move back down for one last move to the upside
you know, this, this is kind of like an elongated rounding top, uh, this is probably more best to find us if we move this up a tiny bit
this more so looks like a bart simpson pattern to me, where you've got, if we flatten this, you've got straight run to the upside
you've got a bunch of spiky tops up here where you just can't really seem to start pushing back above this previous level
and because of this, you've got a massive pole basically running up
and this is normally when this starts to massively capitulate back down to the downside
i know it seems kind of like a meme to even mention like a bart simpson pattern, but i promise you, look at the bitcoin charts and look at how many times we have these bart simpson patterns
we had one here, spiky top, massive move back down to the start of the trend
now, you know, i won't go through the entire charts, uh, you know, i more than welcome you to go through the charts yourself and look at how often these bart simpson patterns play out, uh, on the btc chart
so the only other thing we have to talk about, we talked about the ema ribbons
we talked about the money flow, the bull market support bands
the macd we've talked about, this is flipping bearish on the total crypto market cap, the moving averages, the 13day ema, coming in at 20 800 if we come down to it
that is a indepth update over on the btc and total crypto market cap momentum indicators
just to summarize, no matter what you're looking at, if you're looking at the squeeze mom if you're looking at the macd, if you're looking at the unbalanced volume, if you're looking at the rsi, the money flow indicator, if you're looking at just basic chart structure, all of these indicators that we've got going on right now to talk about the momentum in the markets is starting to fail us
and that is without mentioning the fact that volume has been fairly, fairly flat for this bottoming structure
i mean, depending on where you're looking at it on there was some people stepping in to buy the dip over on binance
but when you have these bottoming structures, when you have these, you know, potentially bullish patterns that you'd want to see breaking up to the upside, this is when you want to see green volume stepping in green volume stepping in, day over day over day, getting exponentially larger
obviously, you can take a dip every now and then, but you want to see a market structure like this what we're seeing
we saw a one day spike in volume followed up with bearish volume, and ever since then, you can see, even this massive run up was a lower high
and subsequently, no matter what chart you're looking at, no matter what moving averages you're looking at, no matter what momentum indicators you are looking at, it is all pointing towards the fact that this sideways crab market is ending, and we're getting ready for that next leg to the downside
i'll talk more about my macro, uh, bear market predictions and where and why, specifically, i think we'll be going down to the ranges between sixteen thousand five hundred and fourteen thousand, but i will upload that after this video
uh, i also have noticed, if we do look at the money flow indicator, you can see left shoulder, head, right shoulder
it looks like we are going to break down to the downside of this
this bullish divergence, or hidden bullish divergence rather, will be starting to fail very, very soon, in my opinion
[Music], hello, and welcome to another quick update about bitcoin
um, i tried to rearrange this ascending trend line in in certain ways to figure out has it really been broken or not
because sometimes, you know, on one time frame it is broken, on the other one is not, depending on if you consider the wicks or not
here, i just have to come to the conclusion this, this trend line was indeed broken
as i said in the previous video, what we are currently doing, and that is now very important
what is happening now? yeah, it is now coming up and retesting this trend line and also the previous resistance here, where it got rejected, as it is retesting it again as resistance
so we tried to break that resistance, tried flip for support, failed
as a result, broke out of this, sending trend line to the downside
found support here somewhere, um, basically at that wave b high at 20 900
but, and this is now important, can we push through this level? if we don't get back into this wage um, and not above this 21 300 or above that 21 364 dollar level, plus minus a few dollars, doesn't matter
and hold it substantially, which means we need to retest it from above
so basically it would look like we're going higher, we retest it and go up
so this is now where probably the, the, you know, sort of the the future here for the next few, few, uh, yeah, hours and days will probably be decided
in this um, wave three, yeah, we would now definitely need to push above this level
we need to push and get, first of all, into this red resistance zone where we probably will be rejected
the more shortterm bearish scenario would really be if that wave 2 was never finished
explained that in the previous video, that we are having our a, b, c here
and in this c wave, which is a five wave move, this could already be the one, the two, then we have the three down, the four up, the five down
honestly, which one of these is going to unfold, i can't tell you
this is what the next few days will show and this is also what now this resistance area is going to show us, i believe here
and if we don't, it will probably get rejected, and we will get into this yellow area between eighteen thousand eight hundred and nineteen thousand six hundred
that would be the area with the highest likelihood where i would expect then, this wave two to end
um, you know, assuming the wave c never ended, the wave b might just have been finished, and all of this was just a corrective move up here
now, a few questions about what is the bearish wave count? well, this is, of course, assuming we are already, we've seen the low here, and we are already on our way up
the reason i show you that so clearly here, and why i'm focusing so much currently on the bullish wave count, is because it is, um, [Music]
we have hit my target area for that overall correction that i talked about, since november december, the longer level wave count target was achieved
one target was reached here that i gave you, which was 17500, was perfectly reached
so bitcoin's still a bit weaker than some other coins, unfortunately
and i believe if bitcoin was a bit stronger, we would see many more coins currently push higher
but it is certainly worth keeping an eye on, definitely, yeah
because there is a real chance we are already reversing, and other people would miss it, who really very much focus on those 10k levels, which are still floating around, which i'm not telling you are never going to happen
therefore, this resistance area, and i mentioned it a few times now, as long as we stay below this level, the downside, potentially, is still very much real, and we could see lower prices
this risk will limit, or will reduce significantly, above that resistance area
also from an elliott wave point of view that what we are doing here is still a corrective wave
okay, so it could theoretically be that, you know, we came down here, that we are still this way 4, that this wave 4 was never finished, um, and that what came down here was maybe has to be reinterpreted, that this was only a wave three, for example
this here is a wave for all of this here, and that we are coming down then once more in a wave five
um, but unless we really go below around about eighteen thousand dollars, we can look into rising prices at the moment, because you can see that we are in a short term uptrend
well, this was supposed to be only really a quick update, so just want to make you aware that we are doing this important retest
it currently looks like we might indeed be breaking it, but it is, again, too early to confirm that, because we need to wait, ideally, for the retest
and then a move above that twenty one thousand seven hundred level here would probably push prices all the way up to 23k bear in mind some other cryptos already did pump quite a bit in the last few days
um, even ethereum, outperformed bitcoin, which is nothing new really
um, but bitcoin is still missing, lagging a little bit behind
so we want to see bitcoin moving up in this bullish scenario, and, um, then we can look at how the other alt coins will probably go up together with bitcoin
just because it's going through here now, it doesn't mean anything
the hourly, um hasn't even the hourly um candle hasn't even closed
and what would be more important would then even be that retest that i just showed you
it's basically a zone between that 21 300 360 and the 21 700 level
also bear in mind the daily candle close is coming up, um, very soon, in a few hours, two and a half hours from now, pretty much
and it will also be interesting and important to know where this daily candle will close, above this level or below it
that is definitely a level all eyes need to be on keep an eye on that level

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
bitcoin has failed to break above these key resistance levels that i indicated in the previous video
so first of all, it failed here the 21 364 dollar level, a very important level
the next one, which would have been important, actually even more important, would have been the twenty one thousand seven hundred and twelve dollar level
it failed to break that, indicating some weakness in the chart
and what that means, we're going to take a look at that in the video
um, first of all, my opinion is there is a chance, at least a chance, which is basically what a lot of people do not expect at the moment that indeed the low was in here at 17 500
i'm still a bit skeptical about this, absolutely, because we have not crossed this important resistance level up here
this is a very important resistance level, structurally, but also based on the extensions of the elliott waves um
and if we go above this resistance level, it will just get much, much less likely that this here is still a corrective move up
so first of all, what is important to understand that we made a lower low here at around 17 500
that was also one of the target levels that i gave you before we reached it for possibly ending this five wave move
and we came down to this and saw a strong reaction to the upside
in addition to that, my target actually, or my scenario, is still pretty much live where i told you that we will have to go in this overall correction here that we have seen with bitcoin, below the 286 k level, below the low of the wave a from june 21
i've been telling you that since november december, based on the elite wave method here, based on an expanded flat pattern, which did evolve and emerge here
now, we did go below 20k, to be fair, but actually, we obviously broke back into my target area
we moved back into the 20k range just a day after we broke it
um, even here with this bullish engulfing candle, and here we had another bullish engulfing candle
how do you say, was never really um, sustainably or substantially broken
so i've always told you that the 20k level is a very, very relevant level
in the current correction, the lower level wave count then suggested even slightly lower levels
there is definitely a chance that the low could have been in already
while a lot of people are still very much promoting lower prices and prices around 10k, i acknowledge that is absolutely possible
but what is also possible that we are already turning around, something which a lot of people do not want to hear at the moment
and to be fair, a lot of people get upset about the same way that a lot of people got upset about when i told you here in november december that we will have to go into the price region below 286 k
i just want to show you here that it is so difficult for people to accept this trend change
it is so important and so difficult for people to really acknowledge that this is happening
now it is very difficult for people to accept that we could get back into an uptrend
the signals for that are still too weak, and it is still too early in the uptrend
but definitely we have some sickness that we have to take seriously
for example, on the daily chart, here a bullish crossover on the rsi, where the purple line moved above that yellow line
we see things like that on the twoday chart, on the fourday chart, coming up as well, and i showed you that as well
and also, we see increased volume, not massively increased volume, but the volume has certainly increased since june, since we hit those lower ranges
in addition to that, we can count this five wave move to the downside as complete
so while obviously it could just be here a first wave of a larger five wave move, this yellow five wave move down, which obviously i can't guarantee that it's not going to happen, we can still go lower
at the moment, the risk for lower prices is still very much there, especially until we break finally this important resistance level up here between 23k and 233 k
okay, so that is just something we need to be aware of, that when the mass of people will be able to accept that we are back in rising prices
and it is not just a socalled dead cat balance, where the cat jumps and falls onto the floor again
that is then when it's oftentimes too late already for them, right? the same way when we came into this downtrend, i've been telling you since 55k, that we have to go into this current price region
yeah, a lot of people only start to accept that we are in such a bear market below 30k
can you believe it? the same way is now a lot of people will only be able to accept that this is a sustainable uptrend above 40 or 45k
that is the first major sign those significant swing highs, which are, first of all, from a technical point of view, important, but also, from an elliott wave point of view, in terms of the extensions, the fibonacci extensions, very um important levels
so only when they are broken you could call it a confirmed uptrend
and what is so the advantage of that method, it allowed us to project those price levels already in november, december the same way, you know, because it is specialized in forecasting trend reversals, something that other methods cannot do, or not to the same degree
so the elite wave method here also told us that at seventeen thousand five hundred dollars, there could be a trend reversal
this is what we don't know yet, no, because a wave a can also be a five wave move
but the higher you go in this wave three, yeah, which is the bullish count, one, two, three, the less likely it will be that it is just an abc
and the more of these structurally important levels you actually take out, the more likely it will be that we actually in a valid impulse
and, um, yeah, the more weakness you see in the chart on the way up, the less likely it is that it is actually one, two, three
so for now, we are, however, breaking out below this um, descending, uh, below this ascending trend line, which for now is not a problem
um, i mentioned to you in the previous video that it could very well, also, in a bullish wave count, be the case that what we have here as a wave 2 in purple, which could have finished here, yeah, on the 22nd of june at around 19 800 dollars, that this might have never been finished, so that basically the wave two is still ongoing because we never reached this target area
yeah, it would have been a very, very bullish wave count, because the retracement in this wave 2 was very weak
so it is very much possible that this is still the wave 2, and that we have only just seen a wave a down, a wave b up, and the wave c, down is now unfolding
now, a bit of a problem i have with that is that the wave b here pretty much comes across as a five wave move
so it is something we need to keep an eye on, um, because normally a wave b would be a three wave move
but somewhere here we finish only the wave one of the wave three
now we are now in the wave two of the wave three, which will come down quite a bit
so at the moment, no reason to panic that we broke to the downside
um, it was sort of expected that we see here a bearish reaction to this resistance
it is an important resistance zone that are highlighted here between these areas
but what i want to highlight that we really need to get above these levels to unlock higher prices
if we go above that 21 712 level, then i think it will unlock prices all the way down all the way up to 23k, pretty sure
um, if we break above that this, this can then unlock prices into the region of 25 to 26 k here, pretty much 26 and a half k
i've actually highlighted for the wave three, based on the fibonacci extensions for a wave three here in purple, the higher level wave three
so this is currently how i see the market generally, bullish signs, in my opinion, are increasing here
and the probability for prices, uh, for for a trend reversal to the upside, is definitely there
however, um, until we break above this red resistance box that you can see on the chart here, um, it could very well all just be still a corrective wave
all i'm doing here at the moment is sketching out this possible impulse to the upside um
and only if we get really above this level, it will become something that we will have to take very, very seriously
and it would still be very, very early in the uptrend, and a lot of people would still believe it is just a dead cat bounce
bear in mind, everything is just still a play in the game with probabilities
let's just take a look once more from the fibonacci extension levels, one, two
it depends on if the wave two, in the end, will come down a little bit lower
but for now, yeah, the 1618 extension level here of the wave 3 is the 26 500 level
and as you can see here, that wave 3 in purple divides into sub waves
and for example, this wave 3 in white, as it is currently labeled, would hit exactly this resistance area here
but we just, i just want to communicate in this video that get familiar with the thought that we might get back into an uptrend
you know, i always hear, you know, where should the money come from? we are in a recession, or we get into a recession, yes, but as soon as you hear economic news, improving in, you know, improvement of the economy, news about that in the in the tv news or in the, in the mainstream media, then most whales have already invested, most institutions have already invested, then prices have probably gone up 20, 30 percent by then, already
you don't want to wait until mainstream media tells you that the recession is over or that inflation is coming down, you know, then it's normally when basically also that, you know, everybody's getting, getting back in, but you obviously want to be early
so, um, you know, it's difficult, um, a difficult topic to grasp
but it's the skill of trying to think differently than than most people that is why most traders also lose money
because most traders are basically following the hurt, which is oftentimes wrong
so i'll keep you updated here about the the moves about bitcoin
certainly here next support levels, if you want to know about bitcoin
definitely next support and, um, it remains to be seen if this year oil was just an a b c
in this case, we will come down once more before we start to go up in the third wave into the region between 188 k and 195
and that would then be another accumulation possibility before we start the rocket ship, potentially

what is up my crypto legends? hope everyone is having a great saturday
let's dive in to see what could potentially happen in the next couple of days
if we, if we smash up that like button altogether right now, we can get to 150 likes
i have a lot of questions here in the comment section already, asking, are you am i in a short yes
i have actually added slightly, uh, to my short position here on um by bit
i am in this, you know, hedge short position, because if we do not manage to get above this high, then i think we could actually roll back down, all right? but if we do get above this high, and this is what i want to explain, i'm in a hedge position
i did add a little bit to my other long position here that i did getting into this right shoulder
as you can see, i've had, i took profits added to my position
the only one that i have in risk is the short where i do have a pretty tight stop loss
also added a little bit to my position, slightly in a loss right now
and, you know, just the stop loss above this height, just in case we do not create a double top
of course, maybe, you know, a lot of people did along here, and maybe a lot of people are going to short from this range, and we're going to, you know, you are going to get stopped out, potentially, because if we do break above this high, you know, it's very likely we're going to go all the way up here to this, 225, 227
okay, k, range, right? the reason why i am shorting this, okay, because i have been bullish
i have been bullish all week with this kind of formation, looking for, potentially, for that move to the upside, to this big, major resistance zone
the only reason i entered a short position right over here is just because of a harmonic pattern, is because of the value area high, you know
the best stop loss that you could have would be above this high over here
if you are going to get above this high, i do see bitcoin having that aggressive leg up, okay, all the way at least to the 224, 225
and you may ask yourself, why to that level? well, if we take a look here at the vp uh, vpvr from the daily okay, so the svp, looking at the volume profile from each day, all right, for the last, you know, 20, uh, 10 to 20 days
what i want to show you here right away is that, you know, we can see the point of controls right over here from each day
on the 15th of june, 16th, 17th of june, we got one right over here on the 21st of june
so if we were to break above this level, you know, we do not have hardly any volume
as you can see right here, the biggest point of control was from the 14th of june, all the way up at the 224, 224
so we start getting above this high, in my personal opinion, it's not going to be a failed breakout
it is very likely going to have that leg up to this range over here
this is why, you know, i am hedging this potential, this long, okay? and just to so you can understand this strategy, you know, this is the only reason i am shorting this, to hedge this long position that is already totally protected, already taken from profits
if it does get stopped out, even better, because i will be riding this short position that i do have here
but if this short that i do have here from this range gets stopped out, this is what i am risking, okay? and because i still have over 50 of my, uh, of my long here, because i did add a little bit the my average position did go up slightly, then, of course, the risk to reward, okay, once i get stopped out here, is gonna be higher than what i have been risking, right? if that makes any sense
so, you know, if i do get break have that break up, you know, it's a four to one from this stop loss
just to so you can understand this kind of strategy of hedging
anyway, my point is, from the thumbnail, next move for bitcoin
if we do break this high over here, if this high is broken on bitcoin, we are going to, very likely, going to have a nice leg up here all the way up to around about the 224, 225, at least guys gaining this high at the 217
that would be approximately about a 700, 700, 800 move to the upside on bitcoin
reason why is because we have a pretty nice gap in volume, okay, from this 217 all the way up here to the 214
all right? very likely to see that nice leg up if we do break the highs
looking at the vp vr, just to be pretty simple, remember, we've got the value area high level
we've got the value area low level from this trading range that we do have
value area low and value area high has been also big resistance zone
so if we start breaking this level, volume starts going very, very low on the vpvr
next big value area, no, i wouldn't say value area high, because there's hardly any volume
next big, major resistance zone is this one over here, where we do have the daily, we have these many four hourly closers also at this range
and we have the biggest point of control, which was on the 14th of june, right over here, sorry, right over here
hardly any volume at this range, between between 217, all right and 224
of course, you do have also the chance that this has been a complete failed breakout from this range
i would still count this as the point 88, which is just be a little bit of major volatility
and then potentially you could actually complete this harmonic pattern
i do think that there's a higher probability in us reaching this supply zone right of the 22 point, you know, between 224, 229 volatility range
okay, where the price should be getting a reaction for a potential shorting opportunity
of course, if you're longing from anywhere here, this would be a take profit zone, no doubt in my mind, because i do see a role back down from this level
pratesh, how are you doing? um, hope you had, uh, i hope you had a sound sleep
do we still hold our short position? i mean, this is a very good question if you are hedging
remember, on yesterday's live stream, okay, we were talking about, you know, for me, really, this is not a trading area
the only reason i, uh, i traded a short here is because i have a backup of a long position from this range
i am backing up my short just in case i get stops out, i will be riding this long position
just in case you do create that double top, that slightly lower high here, and roll down guys in the next coming days
there's only a couple of days, all right, for this potential, uh, harmonic pattern
believe it or not, it's not going to be like this for the next coming 48 hours
in the next 48 hours, we either gonna jump up all the way to this level in less than 48 hours, or actually drop to this low and even break this zone
okay? because we move also in fibonacci time, we also have time
if you want this harmonic pattern to play out from this low to this low area, we would want to see a one to one extension
all right, kind of the same i'm gonna the same amount of time from here right to here
we want the same amount of time from here down to the one to one
if we start making this kind of price action, then this harmonic will be absolutely eliminated
but it's, it's very unlikely to do this price action, uh, in the next couple of days
the only reason why it could happen a lit a lot of sideways action still, it's because it's the weekend, saturday, sunday
last couple of weekends we have seen a little bit of volatility
but the reason why we could go sideways, it's only because of the weekend
um, trend tv, how are you doing? are they chart described please? andy bro for mohammed, absolutely
we do have the dxy getting this major rejection, still getting rejection from this zone
this could be, you know, rocket fuel for bitcoin, if we do see that exy start dropping, all right, in the next couple of days
uh, it's gonna be rocket fuel for bitcoin in the immediate short term
now, we have seen the s p 500 having a pretty nice bounce from these major levels
i was in a long position or not on the dxy, on the dax 30, german stock market
there was a beautiful, beautiful gartley pattern here on on dax 30
i closed my long already, uh, yesterday before the market ended, because i am planning to, you know, take my profits
it's time to collect the profits from your trading platforms, from primex bt, from bibit
this position also on bybit, i will be very lightly closing on the weekend
okay, maybe monday at the latest, because it is time to get the funds withdraw them by the end of the month
take your trading profits, of course, to your wallet or to wherever you want
let's take a look at, um, what was it? are we? let's take a look at rv right away
and i want to see here, i've got joseph here, one of my strongest moderators in the chat
let's take a look at rv, because this one does look like it's like, in a massive, massive descending wedge kind of scenario, right? not really respecting too much, you know, these these levels
but it looks like it is in a kind of a massive, massive descending wedge, um, that will go sideways at some point
will go sideways at some point, and will actually, you know, uh, have, you know, create an uptrend in the next coming months
at some point, you know, this will end, this will finally find a bottom
i would like to see several weeks or several months on on, you know, on price action to the uh, sideways price action
two, to identify a potential bottom, still aggressively in a downtrend, even though you're forming this descending wedge
you know, taking a look at the immediate short term on rv, we need to, you know, we need a focus here
okay, just looking at level to level, we've we can see with this, you know, these levels have been very much respected
look at this, these lows created on february at the 115 range
you know, easy peasy, short position right there, getting resistance at support
but what is happening right now? we are actually hitting this major resistance are we? is this major resistance zone going to hold these lows created? we've already got a reaction
a lot of volatility, a lot of wicks, but we can see the actual consolidation here on rv
the actual consolidation is above the 70 and this is where we are getting that reaction, right? you're trying the the rv price is trying to get above, you know, this 72, 73 range, where we add that consolidation, consolidation, as you can see, right? remember, these wicks are basically, most of the time, are only noise
question is, will this actually fall down? will we get rejected from this zone? and i think, you know, it is, it is very, very possible
you know, is this going to be a lower high? just take a look at fibonacci
we're basically also getting rejected from the 382, important fibonacci level, as you can see, rejection at 302, getting a reaction now the the last few hours on the 382, possibly coming down, you know, at least to the 618 level, to this consolidation is very, very possible on rv
and maybe have a leg up break up from the zone to hit 50, 618 fibonacci levels, right where we do have, you know, these levels are also, look at this
sometimes you do have, you know, these, these uh, this confluence exactly at, you know, fib levels, which is pretty, pretty impressive, where you could decide to take a short or a long
okay? this is all depending on bitcoin, because i am leaning slightly bullish on bitcoin
um, 55 percent of chances for me, that we are going to have this leg up
and because i think we are having going to have this leg up, it will affect the, um, the old coins, all right? the old coins, you know, even though awkward, are hitting major resistance, and there's in a downtrend
and it does look like we're gonna roll down, okay, from big, major levels
if bitcoin does look bullish, and i do think bitcoin is going to gain, you know, a few percentage in the next coming days, because then you will have, you know, a breakout of resistance
if bitcoin is bullish, a lot of altcoins will very likely follow
so let me just go here quickly through the the comment section
we're over 215 people already on the competition, which is absolutely crazy
okay? uh, for the telegram group, it's a huge amount of people
make sure to tag me in the general group if you want the link to join the the um, the the team and also the telegram
how are you doing? thank you very much for joining the live stream
matic is had a pretty, pretty nice leg up here, a pretty nice leg up to even breaking above this major support zone
you know, what we we were talking about very, very likely is waiting for a reaction, right? waiting for a reaction at a certain resistance level
if we take a look here at matic, you know, this solid, solid support range
you know, we actually sliced through on the four hourly chart pretty, pretty nicely
automatic is resistance from this lower high trend line over here
you can see the touches here from the lower highs zone right there
what would be extremely bullish for matic is actually breaking this last lower high
if you break above this range, then, of course, maybe this is not going to get supported because of this insane runup, but you are very likely going to create a higher low and continue back up
all right? so this is something that we'll have to pay attention in the next coming days
if we take a look at another chart where we do have more price data or matic, it's a very, very strong range
we were trading here for over almost two months, in between, you know, the 30 cent level and the 45 50 cent range
this is currently where matic got that beautiful bounce from these lows, almost retesting the 30 cent low here
so we've got a beautiful bounce, very likely that matic is potentially going to create an uptrend in the next coming weeks
i would stay extremely cautious watching bitcoin at all times
but i think matic can create, if we do get rejected from this zone, uh, higher low over here, and then continue and and have a new uptrend um
please check dot and what you think it will survive in what and think it will survive in the next bull run
what's your take? yeah, polkadot is very likely going to survive and will do very well on the bull run, next ball run
if we take a look, just number 10 right now, what i think of polka dot is that is still in development
a lot of blockchain projects still in development, and still has, you know, a lot, a lot of things to do and develop
but, like i said, if we take a look at polka dots, you know, polkadot price levels, you know, polkadot launched around about two, three dollars, approximately
as soon as we got it at pogoda, on the exchanges, it was already a few dollars
so, you know, how much lower can it go? i never seen polka dot below one dollar
so we are, we did, we actually trading at, you know, just slightly above six dollars a few days ago
so how much lower can it go? these are already accumulation levels
if the alltime high here is above fifty dollars, you know, and you are trading at, you know, six dollar range, you know, who cares? buying at six dollars or seven dollars, or or four dollars, or three dollars, or or eight dollars, you know, if you are going to reach these highs at some point, and of course, nothing, nothing is guaranteed
you don't need to reach alltime highs, but on projects such as polkadot, it is very likely to happen in the next coming years, at some point, 2024, 25 26, it's very likely to happen
all right? it's a very, very strong l1 project, and i think it's just gonna do very, very well
so, um, that is my opinion on matic, uh, oh, sorry, on polka dot
and, you know, take a look at the immediate short term for hourly chart to see what could happen in the next coming days
we did have a beautiful, beautiful retest here at this major resistance zone
okay? this support right here turning into very, very strong resistance, and, you know, coming back down and creating this double bottom scenario
now, what is happening right now is that we are having a little bit of bullish momentum, creating these higher lows on polka dot
and the ideal scenario on polka dot would be breaking this nine dollar range
if pogba dot does manage to break this nine dollar range, it is very, very likely going to continue an uptrend
and we've got a big, big support, resistant zone that needs to be broken, then we could potentially look for that higher low scenario, okay, to look for some, for for a nice uptrend, for a new uptrend, till then it's still in a downtrend, still creating lower highs
trent is your friend, despite we did create a small double bottom here
only if we consolidate at this range, i at the nine dollar range, have a large consolidation, not managing to get above this major resistance, lower high trend line, i would consider entering into a short position with very, um, you know, low risk
because, you know, we are in a downtrend, and it's potentially not going to successfully go up
if we break up this major resistance, nine dollar then i would be considering, you know, looking for long positions in the correction
um, that's what i think about polkadot, you know, just keeping it a little bit simple, in a nutshell, um, [Music] is shiva short, says, sam
shib was actually a really, really there was a really good short position on shiba
and, um, i remember very much, um, talking about shiba inu when it was pumping
because, you know, i'm not sure what live stream it must have been on the 21st of june, on the live stream on the 21st of june, i got some people, you know, she, but, you know, he's pumping
and i remember we were just about to hit this range, to hit the support level
and i very much remembered, because a lot of people were, were pretty hyped up with this pump
this is the four hourly chart looking at the, you know, the month of may and also june
you know, getting that consolidation on the full hourly chart
and we talked about, you know, if this level doesn't get a consolidation, doesn't get a stop
and you know, with these all coins, especially meme coins, you just get a bunch of volatility and big bounces
when you have big, massive pumps, you just get big, massive rejections
and you know, we were talking about, you know, if this, and you can check the live stream from the 21st, if this level doesn't hold, or doesn't have a small consolidation, it's very likely going to have that leg up and rejection from this point
and why was that? reason number one for me was this big, massive spike on the vpvr
and also, we were, we did have, you know, pretty large consolidation here as support
you know, we did manage to get above this range and holding it, kind of support, creating a small descending triangle here on the four hourly
and i think we were taking a look at fib levels from this high
okay, there are some different points to take a look at fibonacci levels
from this high to the low, it was, you know, also the 618, from this high zone to this low zone over here, you know, six one, eight, six five
now, you can either think that this is probably going to create a double top
also, for me, it is a risky short, because you want to get into the first retest, always
you want to get into the first, or sec first retest of a resistance or a support
you know, nothing is guaranteed to be a double bottom or a double top, but it also can happen
so, you know, if you have good risk management, you know, why not, you know? and sometimes you do get these wicks and then the rejection to get that people that speculate it's going to be a double top, guys, but this is the risk, you know, you either wait for that wick and that rich in rejection where you do have a swing failure pattern, and then you jump into a trade that would be, you know, the high high probability trade right there
but of course, you know, there is also a scenario here that sheba might just roll down from these levels
and then you might think, oh, i was waiting for that swing failure pattern
i was waiting for that, you know, pump and dump, for the confirmation, and i missed out big time in this correction
but this is, this is, you know, part of the game, you know, you either getting now, or you wait for a reaction, you wait for a potential failed breakout, swing failure pattern, or you risk it right now where you are very close, you know, risk to reward here's can be pretty high
can be pretty high, your stop loss here on shiba inu, you know, against the the potential gains that you can have, at least a a two to one trade
i would consider taking profits at this zone over here, because it's been a major, major zone as support big consolidation on on chiba um of course, i'm not gonna shout out the the number here, because it's, you know, point zero, zero, zero, zero one, leveled right there
or the point zero zero, zero one one seven right over here, for a double top
ideal scenario for me would be having a little spike to the upside, and closing at least a one hourly, or even four hourly, better, getting another consolidation, giving you that confirmation of weakness
breakout, you know, kind of a bearish divergence here with the higher highs and lower lows on the rsi
and then jump into that trade, you know, for that failed breakout
it's already, it already looks pretty good for a short i'm not going to lie
but this is up to you, you know, will you manage to have a tight stoploss? will you manage to get stopped out? you know, there's always room, there's always time to get back in a trade, if you're not risking too much, if you get stopped out, and then come down and confirm that this leg up has been a complete failure, failure
you know, again, entry stop loss above the the highs that you have created, and then, you know, try and ride that trend to the downside
um, of course, i would be looking at fibula and fibonacci levels from this low to take profits to the high that you do create
you know, already taking profits at 50 percent, protecting position eight
um, so, yeah, not much to add more or er on shiba inu, a double top scenario right here, at the biggest point of control from the last two months traded
there's a high probability that this will fail and will continue back down
um, yeah, not much to add there on she but, you know, uh, morning
uh, jamie, how are you doing? morning? andy, can you please check crow, please? bro, absolutely
and where is the possible level to short for shorting? okay, we can do some analysis on on roon here for my members
first of all, let's take a look at crow right away, see what's going on
we are at the value area high from the volume traded, you know, the last 10 days, approximately, value area high zone, just about to kind of break it
we have created a kind of inverse head and shoulder scenario here on crow, as you can see, right, you know, nice, big consolidation right there
it is very, very possible that we are going to go higher on crow in the next coming days
and this is only going to be a massive relief rally inside of a very aggressive downtrend
guys, don't get extremely bullish if we do have that leg up on crow, because it we will be starting to, you know, en enter a nice shorting opportunity
i think we can go to the 15 cent level, even 16 or 17 cents for crow
i would be waiting patiently to reach those levels for a potential shorting opportunity
and i think the downtrend inside was action is very likely to continue in the next coming months, at least
coming back down to retest these lows at some point will happen, in my opinion
so if we take a look at, you know, value area low, big, big zone
from the volume traded on the 12th of may till the 10th of june, all right, almost a month of volume traded, we've got a value area high
we've got a biggest point of control at this level, and we've got a value area low
and biggest point, biggest spike, um valieri low, first major resistance where the price is very likely going to get a reaction, where it's very likely going to get, you know, a potential rejection and have a little bit of a correction right there
and if we take a look at the highest point, you know, from this consolidation to the lowest point, you know, high to low, this is where i would look at my fibs, from this high point right there to the low point
confirming the confluence from this support level, fibonacci value area low, you know, and and continuing the downtrend, very likely at this point
but this is why i would take profits already, depending on where we finish, all right, at 50 fibonacci retracement
so by short from this range at the 16 17 cents, you know, we might even not reach those levels in the coming weeks, but if it does reach that would be a good shorting opportunity for me, and i would be aiming for the 50
that would be the kind of movement just in case you do create a higher low in the next coming weeks
if bitcoin is bullish, it will help the altcoins to have bullish momentum
if bitcoin starts getting rejected from this zone, you know, and creates a kind of a double top here, it might have a harmonic and, you know, starts falling in the next coming days
um, i think, you know, this one right over here, it does look bullish
i just, i do see some bullish momentum in the next coming um days for for crow, creating, you know, slightly higher lows, higher highs, till we've, you know, reach higher levels and and consolidate sideways
uh, of course, first rejection zone for crow would be the 382 50
you know, you might, you know, the 382, we already see on the 382 that we have had, um, you know, a reaction here as support
so, 14 cents, 14 cents can be immediate shortterm rejection on crow
uh, let's take a look at roon, and then i'll go through the next super chat here on chris
pp, santos egold, i'm going to take a look at egold, or for chris
um, should i close my eagle trade? uh, s p 500, quite bullish, as chris
i mean, this is the thing, it is, you know, bitcoin, in my personal opinion, is looking more bullish than bearish
you know, the deal guys, even though, you know, some altcoins are going to be facing major resistant zones, they are probably not going to get rejected
if bitcoin has a pump, all right, in the next couple of days, you might see some resistance, volatility and breakouts
we can zoom in on the four hourly on roon right away to see what kind of price action we do have
okay, this would be the ideal scenario, something like this, something like this, you know, to see a reaction from these levels
we are currently facing this major resistance very, very well
and we would have to see roon if we are going to get, you know, without a volatility
and here's where, you know that the price action is facing that resistance, and you could enter a potential short
um, fibonacci levels, breaking through the 50 percent, it is likely that to have one last leg up, at least to the six, one, eight levels from this current drop
and we got a major, major zone here that has been respected before, which is the 260 cents
i would would be waiting patiently to see how we react at this level
we either react at this 50 right now, in the next, you know, one to two days, or we react at this level over here
so far, not interested in shorts, because the uptrend is looking pretty, pretty strong, no signs of stopping anytime soon
once i see signs of stopping soon, then i could potentially enter a short when you consolidate, when you get a reaction
roon, i mean, rune hasn't had an insane run up the last four days
you get up to 4 450 worth of bonus, okay, to be claimed at the rewards hub once you sign up with a link in the description
it's they added 400 worth of bonus because of the world series of trading competition
now it's up to four thousand and four hundred and fifty dollars that can be claimed
you need to follow the steps to claim all of that bonus in the rewards of one by a bit
let's go here through um egold, because it, i mean, all of these, all coins are having some pretty nice bullish momentum
uh uh? [Music], yeah, i think we were talking about eagle here at this resistance channel, or that potential short, right? we do have a lot of resistance here on e gold
so your question, chris, is, should i close my ego trade? i guess you're in a short position because you're saying that, you know, the s p 500 is looking bullish
i mean, i think you could react from this range and get a corrective move on roon
on e gold, we got the um vbr levels, big spike on the vpvr levels from the volume traded in between may and june
you could get that one last leg up here, one push and and then that corrective move
i mean, this is the thing, you are having slightly higher highs here
you are just about to create a double top, or another slightly high high
if this does pump a little bit more and gets a small reaction, that would be the ideal short scenario
i guess you are in a small loss or break even if you're shorting from this range
big, big resistance level right over here on eagle, in between the 64 cents, 66
one of the reasons that i do not mainly trade all coins because of their volatility
um, i'm very much comfortable with bitcoin, just trading bitcoin
you know, big, big resistance from this ascending channel, as you can see, very well respected higher lows higher lows being respected
one last leg up here, maybe on e gold, is the potential trigger for that short position
um, this is the thing, you either get stopped out if you're risking just a little bit, you know, should i close my short or, depending on where you shorted, of course, i wouldn't mind shorting this, actually, this on e gold
if you do, if i do have one last leg up, i would be very much considering entering a short position
i'm actually going to put an alert here to see, you know, how we react
how is that pump? because you can have a big, massive pump also like this, if you start breaking above these highs, then this is very likely going to turn into a shortterm support level, and you will be getting a bounce from this range to almost retest the highs that you do create in the short term
so they are a small, quick scalp and day trades from these moves on egold, that can happen
this does look like it is ready for that corrective move after this momentum to the upside
don't get, don't get, you know, extremely scared their probabilities in getting rejection
you know, at this you know, 64, 66, uh, 66 dollar range is highly, highly probable
you know, the highs of this ascending channel, slightly higher highs
no big, massive momentum, you know, just slightly higher highs, ready for that move down? yeah, this is all up to you
btc will go up because macro is getting a little better this week
commodities are finally going down, and investors finally saw for the first time inflation is slowing down
you know, it's always good to see, um, you know, fundamentals, you know, if there is nice, if there's good sentiment, if there's bullish sentiment, if the, you know, investors confidence is is bullish or or bearish, of course, this will affect the market
but, you know, just by doing technical analysis, i know how to make gains on just by doing technical analysis, despite whatever is happening in the market
natural gas prices are going to absolutely, you know, still continue to skyrocket
i entered a short position here on, you know, natural gas on primix bt, making huge gains
i mean, i'm so, the reason why i closed my long on on, on dax um 30 is because i've had a really nice month on primix bt
made over a quarter of a bitcoin, which is absolutely phenomenal
and this is, i'm gonna withdraw, you know, this, these, these profits from the month, uh, to my cold wallet because, yeah
and basically, i've had a pretty nice month, and i don't want to have the funds on the exchange, you know, all the profits out
all right, if you check out the live stream, um, you know, i was looking for that distribution
this was a, not clear, this was a absolutely insanely clear distribution event on natural gas
this is something i wanted to point out because, yes, this is a crypto channel, but i like to, you know, analyze some other markets in my free time, especially when primex bt, you can trade other different assets using bitcoin or ethereum, or any other other stable coins such as usdt and usdc, as collateral
i'm saying, guys, most of the people, most of the retail, you know, thinking of eastern europe, you know, conflict that is happening right now, that started in march, okay, february, march
i'm not sure exactly when this is how, you know, i don't really, i mean, i do care, of course, of what is happening, but don't pay too much attention to what is of the news and what's going on, you know
for the next coming months, we are going to see much higher prices
you know, no, this is not the moment that you need to be, you know, extremely bullish on natural gas
who cares or what is happening? i mean, with all of my respect, just by looking at the charts and and the fundamentals, who cares what is happening worldwide? you know, smart money is not buying at these peaks over here
if no one is clear of what is a a wike of distribution event, it is right over here
you just need to understand how, you know, smart money leaves at the peaks
when you break the alltime high slightly, you slightly create higher highs, just for a potential big drop
i i got stopped out at a small loss, because i did enter at this spike here and then got stopped out
but i reentered once i saw this full fourth peak at this level
and you can check out the live streams, uh, from this short position, it was a beautiful short position
you know, looking for that six dollar range, okay? looking for that retest at least of these lows and this high, you know, from this level
this was a, you know, this was about a six to one, you know, risk to reward right there
um, anyway, so this is, you know, this is the best example to say it is not only technical analysis
for me, it is only technical analysis, not, it is always technical analysis, it is only technical analysis
once the conflict starts, right in in eastern europe, you know, speculating that, right, a lot of people are going to rush in, you know, to to to buy up, okay, to trade long, uh, natural gas
but not after a couple of months, all right? when the natural gas prices have more than doubled in less than two months, then you see this exhaustion distribution
when you have, you know, most of the people of your family and friends talking about, oh, my goodness, natural gas prices are going to go higher
i think, um, you know, crude oil will come down, um, because this is, you need to go, you need to have that inverse, you know, sentiment against retail people
you can check that trade, you know, from the 9th, 10th, 12th of june, around this area
you can use bitcoin ethereum usdt has collateral trade, gold, oil, natural gas, you know, dow jones, nasdaq
i do use this platform a lot, and today, and the month of june has been absolutely insane
i do not change the bitcoin into dollars, not on this platform
you deposit ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred dollars on top of that
you deposit, you know, fifty thousand dollars, you're getting three thousand, five hundred
it's really good to do networking, you know, the the dubai mafia, the dubai crypto mafia, as my moderators say, right? what do you think of ftx bailing out blockfi and voyager? i am not aware of this
what's going on with this coin? man? why are so many people like this cryptocurrency? do i have to take a look at jasmine? do i have to do a little bit of research? jasmine coin, it's 400
is this a scam coin? is this a scam coin? this one had a big, massive drop
jasmine coin, from two dollars in march of 2018, it went down to to one cent
if you are bullish on this cryptocurrency, i have to say, this is the moment you want to buy, when you are finding a floor
i'm not sure if you want to trade it or invest it, but for investing, investing is so much easier than trading
because when a price of something is is pumping like crazy, yes, you can buy and make a 2x, a quick 2, 3x, you know, if you don't know how to buy and know how to sell, and don't, you know, and don't, uh, get massive euphoria and say, i'm gonna hold it
you don't buy at these big, major drops, or these pumps, or, you know, when you're dropping aggressively
you start buying when you know the potential floor is in, the potential floor is in
you're creating a kind of a lot of sideways action right there
a lot of old coins will die, and this one might just do like this for for several years
um, but you know, it is the moment, if you are bullish on a project, it is, these are the moments you wanna, you wanna stack up when it's absolutely going sideways
the selling pressure has got absolutely exhausted right now, and you're just gonna go flat
um, let me just analyze, you know, if you're talking, i think this one, you know, is available on on, i don't know right why, but it does ring a bell that this one is available on, um, yeah
so, you know, let's just take a look at the immediate short term right over here
massive, massive, aggressive lower highs, very much respected here
if we do connect this big, we've got biggest point of point of control here from the last couple of months traded
price action has been touching with volatility, this low range
what range? the eleven point, zero one one cent level, point zero one one here on jasmine
this is very likely a rejection point here for a roll back down
you know, this point, point zero one one, is a strong, strong resistance, six one eight, from the start of the drop
you know, your massive descending triangle right there, breaking down, aggressive move to the downside, not managing to break the lows, coming back up
uh, potential rejection here at the point zero one one is very, very, very likely
but it's very, very likely, in my opinion, that we're not going to have a successful breakout on, on, on jasmine
if you're looking for the highest probability trade, it is here
uh, you know, it's if you pump slightly, a little bit more and get a couple of rejections
all right? on the price action is when you want to jump in a trade here on jasmine
but looking for, you know, longterm position, longterm portfolio, this is the moment you want to start buying if you believe in the project, right? qnt, is usdt safe? i get a question from nb
i mean, this is on everybody's mind, everybody, every crypto investor
but most of the trading platforms, the big, big platforms, use us dollar tether
us dollar coin and us dollar tether are very safe, in my personal opinion
um, there will not be, you know, a big, massive withdrawal of all of the usdt and usdc
if usdct were to lose a little bit of its, you know, value, you know, the dollar peg
dollar tether, you know, either going down in value, disappearing, or whatever you want to think about it
i think, you know, because most of the big, big exchanges, big crypto investors, companies use us dollar tether
it's unlikely it's going to be, you know, devalued well below one dollar
you could have that volatility between 96 cents, 95 cents, uh, it would go straight back up to one dollar in a matter of a few days, in my personal opinion
should we looking at the top 100 at least, to avoid promoting, giving exposure to these coins? i mean, this is the thing, it doesn't matter
this is what i said, you know, i have no idea what this coin is
stay cautious, because this, you know, this was maybe a dead coin
this is maybe a coin that is dead, and it's just going to go sideways for years and years and years, um, until a millionaire comes and and and, you know, decides to pump the price and buy, you know, 10 million dollars worth of jasmine, because it's got such a low mark capitalization, it will have a massive, big jump, pure, pure, you know, speculation
and, you know, i don't know, this is not a coin that i would, um, i would look at, not financial advice is marielle porto, absolutely
says ricky um, let's take a look or at, um, flm, why not? is this flamingo finance? flame, flamingo finance
i mean, if you are good, you know, trading these highly volatile all coins, if you are good, you know, finding the the top or the bottom, uh, you know, you can make huge, huge gains on these altcoins
yeah, they have added flamingo here on vivid, i think, uh, maybe a few weeks ago
i mean, if you managed to to buy here and sell here on flamingo finance
you know, if you're using a 10x leverage for all coins, pretty high
of course, you have absolutely no idea if this is going to happen
you know, this is why this is, you know, this is kind of a roulette for me
these all coins are like, too, too volatile for my style of trading
um, i mean, what can i say about this cryptocurrency? what would you say about this crypto you know, you you created the lows here in late 2020, 20, early 2021
is this the bottom? you know, are we going to get a big bounce from the lows created on 2020 and 2021? this is the million dollar question
i do not, i don't like to analyze all coins, basically, if they're not in the top 50 or top 100, like someone said here in the comment section, they are very, very unpredictable
you know, when i do technical analysis, i want a strong market, such as bitcoin, ethereum, or, you know, oil, natural gas, uh, strong market with a lot of liquidity
you take a look at these cryptos, you know, flamengo finance, and, you know, they've got less than 50 million market capitalization, which is an absolute baby
this is, there's no, there's no ta to apply on these kind of coins most of the time, because you get these kind of pump and dump scenarios
can you check ethereum, please? i am in a short right? let's take a look at ethereum, also qnt and ethereum
is it good? short opportunity? ibm ibrahim, john, i did take a look at, um, i did take a look at shiba inu just about 10, 15 minutes ago
let's take a look at some other all coins here for the community
but anyway, you know, a lot of us, it doesn't you know, you didn't need to buy them, but you can trade them if you're good
i do not trade, you know, these lowcap cryptocurrencies because i don't need to
i only needed to trade bitcoin and ethereum and a couple of highcap coins to make huge gains by the end of the month
why? why risk? you know, why risk every once everyone wants to buy that
who wants to get into that 200 percent pump with a 10, 20 x leverage to make, you know, 5 000, you know, gains? why? if you can make 50 gains, 100 gains, you know, during the the weeks, and then at the end of the month you might make, you know, 500 gains of your, you know, what you have been risking
and this is how i trade, uh, because it's, i don't know how to trade any other way from trying to to catch these, you know, be emotional and trying to get into these 1 000 pumps
you're going to, you're basically going to going to not be, not be a successful trader at the end of the day
here, i want to give you a little bit of chat guys, a little bit of my opinion, a little bit of my experience
i've only been trading, i've only learned how to trade, uh, 2017
i've only been five years in, you know, the trading, you know, technical analysis industry
it's been enough to know what work, what works for me, and what doesn't work for me
let's take a look at qnt and zoom out a little bit to see what is happening
we are have to go through bitcoin, the number one crypto, to see what is going on
this one does look like that a bigger relief rally is likely to happen
um, i would say, you know, reason number one, let's take a look at the rsi to confirm these bullish divergence where we do have, we do have higher, you know, these lower lows on the price action and higher lows on the rsi, giving us that bearish exhaustion
i think we are basically getting rejected from lower high trend line here
good thing about this one is that we have actually gotten above a big, a big, big zone, which big zone, this one right over here
i think, you know, the possibility in actually going to higher is very positive
well, there we have it, the biggest, biggest resistance point of control
we've got biggest point of control, fibonacci, i would go, with this height to this low
so we've got above the six one eight, but seven, eight point seven eight is a big fibonacci level
you could already, you know, look for that short position already on quantia um
big, big level to short, not even waiting for a reaction, because you've got too much confluence
you've got the seven, eight point seven eight point seven eight fib level
from this drop, you've got biggest point of control and you've got the lower high trend line here you are
and what does the trend tell us? trend is telling us, you know, we are still going down, despite these big relief rallies
um, there is a possibility on, on, on quant, on this retracement, to get a bounce from this level
60 range could be a strong support level where we could get about, um, you know, we're hitting fifty percent level, or six, one eight from this pump
so you could get that stop here on quant for maybe another attempt in breaking the highs
looking at the short term, i think we could drop in the coming days, after this big pump that we've had, uh, in the these last few days, correction is likely, at least to round about the sixty dollars
stakeholders at sixty dollars, because you could get that, you know, you could get that bounce from that 59, 59 range
you know, just looking at shortterm levels on quant, i mean, this would have been a beautiful shorting opportunity
very fast, very difficult short but if you get your levels marked up, you know, biggest point of control at this range, not even reaching the biggest point, but you have a lot of spike in vpvr, the 778 important fibonacci level
okay, from these highs to the lows, we hit that level, to the exact scent on uh, on a on quant, and you got the resistance trend line from these lower highs, continuation to the downside
there's a quick, nice, little day scalp day trade right there
it's only available on, available on spot, not for leveraged trading
we do not have any squid grow here, unfortunately, on coin gecko
so it's, you know, definitely not going to be here on, yeah, on trading view
when are you, are you going to dump? when when are we going to dump? says priest of crypto
bitcoin is looking f i mean, you would say that this is an exhaustive uptrend, right? this is an exhaustive uptrend
and, you know, we are seeing the balls struggling here with this uptrend
so, you know, you would assume that we are going to get that corrective move very, very soon
this inverse and head inverse head and shoulder, you know, kind of scenario right here
where i, where would i be bearish? guys? if we have a leg up and get a reaction at this, you know, 2 000 in between, 2 000, sorry, twenty two thousand four hundred dollars
and twenty two thousand nine hundred dollars is my shorting area
it is also the vpvr, you know, on this, you know, the svp, sorry, the daily level right there
you know, this is the big resistance level that i am, you know, willing to short
the only reason why i am not shorting here is because of this inverse head and shoulder scenario, getting above the neckline, retesting the highs
valley area, high is just about to get broken out, you know? um, yeah, this is a, for me, it's almost a 50 50 shorting levels
very good strategy, if you know how to get into, you know, a long ender short at what levels? this was very much explained on yesterday's video
i really like to explain why i'm in, you know, why did i enter a long position here? why am i short hedging here? you know, because for me, the probabilities in bitcoin, you know, having that leg up to this range is very, very high, or even it is high, to create a double top, lower high scenario and actually come down in the next coming days, potentially to complete this harmonic pattern that will be invalidated, uh, by tomorrow, depending on what kind of price action
okay, we've only got to the 27th, late, uh, late tomorrow to actually complete this drop
if we don't start dropping, you know, in the next 24 hours, this will very much be invalidated
i would be even more bullish if we just hover around here, because that leg up, it will very likely happen, guys, uh, ethereum, looking for dump
now, andy, why is aetherium in a short position? ethereum, ethereum, ethereum
what is, uh, we do have this kind of inverse head and shoulder scenario here, right? um, we've got the lower highs, lower highs, lower highs, lower highs, very well respected here
you know, this means you are, you are kind of reading the chart properly, in my opinion
if you do get more volatility, even better, showing weakness of the balls
but i would stay a little bit cautious here on the potential corrective move
we can either stop at the 50, 618 fib level, from the load to the highs, which would be at the 1000
so, you you can stop in between 1160 and 1120 would be a zone where, you know, ethereum might be getting a bounce
but, yeah, definitely corrective move on ethereum in the coming days, in the coming hours, actually, very, very possible
uh, i like to focus on bitcoin before i take a look at ethereum
because if, if, if, ethereum, right, if you're going to take a look at the textbook technical analysis, move right from this low to the high, you know, breakout should take you almost to 1 500
yeah, let's forget about that for the moment um and all depending on what bitcoin does
guys, if i am looking for bitcoin to have that leg up, potentially to the 224 um
uh, if bitcoin does get that 800, 900 pump, because ethereum is very likely break, gonna break this high if bitcoin is going to be bullish
but if bitcoin reaches, if bitcoin does reach 225, 226 in the next coming hours, and we do see what hours and, you know, next coming hours, 48 hours, right reached, reaches those levels, and we do see ethereum not managing, you know, just retesting even the high zone here, you know, just going to 1271, 1280, while bitcoin is all the way up here, then i would say, wow, this is the time to short, guys
ethereum has just pumped just a little bit, retested the highs here to get that liquidity grab, and then it will have a corrective move
um, i would still, i would wait patiently, depending what bitcoin does

my name is josh, and right now the bitcoin price is potentially flipping this previous resistance into new support, which i'll be talking more about in just a moment, alongside the shortterm ethereum charts
and we also have some other important patterns to pay attention to moving forward
so definitely watch this video to the end so that you don't miss out on any of these important information
and obviously, we still have these bullish divergence playing out
and that bullish cost in the 12hour bitcoin macd so nothing much has changed on this chart over the past few days
so if you're new to the channel, check out some of my recent videos on the channel that i've posted over the past few days if you want more information about this chart, right here
but getting straight into the four hour bitcoin charts, looking at this inverse head and shoulders pattern that i've been talking about over the past few days
and what we've seen happen over the past one day is a slight breakout above this line of resistance, which was sitting at around 21 000
but as the bitcoin price moved above that line of resistance, we haven't seen a lot of confirmation
obviously, we do have some four hour candle closes above this line of resistance, which is technically one form of confirmation
but as of right now, at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is yet to break above this previous height that we set a few days ago, which was sitting at around 217 k
and so that level just there, that previous height at 217 k, should be acting as some shortterm resistance, which is why that level is also an important level to pay attention to moving forward
and if you take a look at the volume indicator, looking at how much volume we saw on this breakouts
and obviously, you can see that the volume is actually still declining
we haven't seen any significant volume coming in as we moved past this line of resistance, which is one indication revealing that we haven't really seen a proper breakout to the upside, despite the bitcoin price drifting above this line of resistance
and right now, an important level of support for bitcoin to hold above is, of course, this neckline, which is currently coming in at around 208 k
because if the bitcoin price holds above that level, and, in fact, if we see a bounce from that level like this, then that would be further confirmation for a breakout to the upside
because, of course, a successful retest, in this case, flipping previous resistance into new support, is bullish market structure
but right now, at the time of recording this video, we're basically in the middle of this retest
and if we end up seeing a confirmed break back below this line that i just mentioned, at around 208 k, with something like a fourhour candle close back below that level, then that would essentially invalidate this breakout to the upside, which would, of course, invalidate this entire inverse hundred shoulders pattern
we haven't seen a lot of confirmation for this breakout at the time of recording in this video
and this brings us to another bitcoin pattern that is potentially forming right now on the same fourhour bitcoin chart, which is a rising wedge pattern
and this pattern, on the other hand, is actually a bearish pattern
so this, of course, contradicts the inverse hundred shadows pattern
but this rising wedge pattern only confirms if we break below this level of support, which is currently coming into play at around 21 000
so really, if we break below around 21k, but more importantly, that 208k level, then that is how, you know we're starting to flip more bearish
in the shorter term, potentially just in the coming days, something like a move like this, for example, is what i would expect moving forward if we break below the support levels that i just mentioned
but technically speaking, if we see a break to the downside for this rising wedge pattern, the technical price target is actually at the bottom of the wedge, which is sitting at around 17 and a half thousand
but obviously, even though that might be the price target for this pattern, if we do break to the downside
keep in mind that we have some other levels of support along the way
for example, this previous low, coming into play at around 19 to 20 000
and these lows that the bitcoin price formed back here during the middle of this month, were also coming in at around 20 000 per bitcoin, which shows us there is still a lot of support around 20 000
so when it comes to bitcoin's shortterm price movements, those are the important levels that i'm paying attention to moving forward
but as of right now, we're simply waiting to see more confirmation, for example, more volume coming into play for this breakout to the upside
or if we confirm a break below those levels of support that i just mentioned, especially this neckline, then we could see a movement to the downside
and in that scenario, i would expect the bitcoin price to revisit that 20k low
and if we confirm a break back below this previous low, which is coming in, more specifically, at around 197 k, then it's entirely possible we could revisit that 17 and a half thousand dollar low
and because i already know i'm probably going to get some comments on this video telling me that i'm just predicting both directions
and for those people, i recommend doing a little bit more research into how trading works
because, of course, when it comes to trading these shortterm fluctuations, we need to look for confirmations of breaks above resistance or breaks below support, for example
so let's just say if we confirm a break above significant resistance, then that might be a signal to enter into a long trade, for example, just in the shorter term
or a confirmed breaker back below support could be a signal to enter into a short position
so that way, it's actually possible to make money no matter what direction the price moves, as long as you know your levels of confirmation and your price targets in both directions
but obviously, zooming back out to that 12hour bitcoin chart, and this all falls in line with that slightly larger time frame, showing a lot more choppy, sideways price action to come
and if you're taking a look at the ethereum chart on the 12hour time frame, you can see right here that this is extremely similar to the 12hour bitcoin chart
so once again, due to this bullish divergence that is still active on the chart and this bullish cost that we saw a few days ago, we are still due to see reduced bearish momentum in the shorter term on the 12hour ethereum chart, just like bitcoin
and now zooming into the four hour ethereum to yours dollar charts, taking a look at this inverse header shoulders pattern, you can clearly see that we've attempted a retest, but ethereum, as of record in this video, hasn't made it all the way down towards that neckline, at least just yet
and by the way, this neckline is coming into play at around 1130 to 1140
and it is important for ethereum to hold above that price level just there, because once again, if we confirm a break back below the neckline, that would invalidate this breakout for the inverse tender shoulders pattern, which would invalidate the price target i spoke about yesterday
but as of right now, for the ethereum to us dollar charter, at least in the immediate shorter term, ethereum is looking a little bit stronger than bitcoin due to the fact that we have broken above that previous high that we set a few days ago, which was coming into play at just below 12 k
but keep in mind, we still have these levels of resistance that we formed during the middle of this month
so that would be the next shortterm range of resistance for ethereum that i'm paying attention to moving forward
and while we're on the fourhour ethereum chart, technically speaking, the price of ethereum is also forming a rising wedge pattern, which once again, is technically a bearish pattern, because more often than not, it breaks to the downside
but sometimes, around 30 percent of the time, it breaks to the upside
but anyway, this line of resistance is coming into play at around 1250 to 1260, so pretty close to those previous heights that i just mentioned
and this line of support is coming into play at around 1 150, approximately, which is pretty close to the neckline for this inverse header shoulders pattern
so once again, if we confirm a break back below that neckline, which would also confirm a break to the downside from this rising wedge pattern, that would be the shortterm bearish scenario where we could see a continued move to the downside in the short term, in the coming days for ethereum
and once again, the technical price target for a rising wedge pattern is the bottom of the wedge, which is coming in at around 900 per ethereum
for example, this previous load that we formed a few days ago coming into play at around 1040 to 1050
and another reason why this 1050 support level for ethereum is important is due to the fact that that is where the 382 fibonacci level is coming into play on the weekly ethereum chart, when you're bringing out the fibonacci retracement tool from the march 2020 low to the alltime high on the log scale
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum versus bitcoin charts on the weekly time frame, right now, we're still playing out a short term belt for ethereum versus bitcoin, which is why a theorem, in the shorter term, is looking a little bit stronger than bitcoin
but keep in mind this is still just in the somewhat shorter term, because the larger trend here is still showing lower highs and lower lows
and just keep in mind what we've seen in this bear market so far, compared to what we saw in the 2018 bear market for ethereum vs bitcoin
and so technically speaking, if you're just comparing this market to 2018, we technically still have more room to the downside for ethereum versus bitcoin
and this shortterm bounce on the weekly ethereum versus bitcoin charts is happening as the weekly ethereum rsi is bouncing from that oversold territory
but what is interesting is we saw something very similar during the 2018 bear market
in fact, towards the beginning of the 2018 bear market, we saw an initial drop off for ethereum versus bitcoin, and then we saw a decent sized balance, and then a much larger drop off for ethereum versus bitcoin, until the rsi on the weekly time frame became oversold
and then we actually saw a twoweek bounce for ethereum vs bitcoin, one more dip and then a more significant bounce, which basically reset the rsi towards neutral levels, giving us more room to the downside later on for one last significant lake to the downside for ethereum versus bitcoin
and if you're looking at this bear market so far, we've seen that initial move to the downside, a bounce back up, and then a slightly bigger move to the downside, somewhat similar to what we saw back here in 2018
and right now we're potentially at that stage, if we were to compare the current stage in the market to what we saw last time
but keep in mind, just because something played out a certain way last time, it doesn't guarantee we're going to see the exact same again moving forward
but we can still use this just to give us an insight of what we could expect moving forward, based on previous markets

i really hope you enjoyed it, and i'll see you all in the next video
so for the past two weeks, we have been heading to the downside, after we did poke our head above this sideways channel, uh, that we've basically been residing in since the third of may
so more or less, if we clear up the data and look at it how it is
we've more or less just been in a sustained crowd market, trending sideways for quite some period in time
right now, at least in the short term, though, it is very, very evident that we are still in an uptrend
and i would like to highlight, you know, these cycles do happen time over time, over time, again, but you do have a big move up, and then you start crabbing to the side
for example, right over here, we literally went sideways on the bitcoin dominance
i mean, from here to here, we were the exact same, uh, percentage on the bitcoin dominance for 238 days
and you can see, you know, this is very, very similar to the market structure that we had where we rose above
is slightly different, because in this instance, we rose above this w pattern and then went sideways
in this instance, we just started to move up to the top of the channel, and since then we broke back down, but we are still making higher lows in the market structure now, uh, it does seem very evident to me that the bitcoin dominance is still very, very bullish
if we get everything back on the chart, you can see, i mean, we had a massive runup for one, two, three, four, five weeks straight, and currently drawing from the low to the high, it looks like we're coming back down to the w breakout 786 fibonacci
so if i remove the drawings once again, to make it a little bit more clearer what's going on
from this low to the high, we came back into this orange box, which is the most important range of um of support for the fibonaccis when you're drawing from the low to the high
and it's the most important level of resistance when you're drawing from the high to the low as well
so drawing from this low to this high, on this uptrend, we are currently residing just above the 786 fibonacci
so in my opinion, as long as 43 holds, we're probably going to be completely fine for the dominance
so we could see another slight flush to the flush to the downside for the next couple of days, before we do start booting back to the upside
so why has the dominance been heading down? well, there's a very, very simple reason for that
but if we switch back over to the japanese candlesticks, which most people use anyway, you can see for the past week we've been pumping, because we've basically been sitting at bitcoin's previous alltime high
why are old crimes bouncing? in my opinion, because bitcoin's bouncing
old cranes have been getting decimated against the bitcoin dominance for months now, and subsequently, this is just a very exuberant relief rally, in my opinion
now some of the momentum indicators are calling for something different
however, i would like to highlight, on the weekly time frame, this very much
uh, maybe a break, because the dominance does like to take these breaks every now and then, especially on the weekly
for example, when we were in this bearish trend, you can see we had a three week break where we started to head bullish, headed back down, and then you can see massive break to the downside, three, three weeks worth of relief rally, and then you broke back down here
massive run up, you took a week break, and then stepped in for another two weeks
and then on the upside, quite recently, we had this massive runup
we took a break for a week while we were in this downtrend, coming down to this box of fibonaccis, we had another leg up up to here, and now we're coming down
and we're currently once again coming down, just like we did here
so if we look at the market structure on the weekly time frame, we took a break as we were coming into these fibs
now we're taking a two week break as we're coming into these fifths
so, you know, once again, higher time frames, nothing has changed
it is interesting to see how well all cranes have performed, though, we'll be talking about that in just a moment
but we do need to recognize, you know, we look at the time, uh, we look at the bitcoin alltime chart, and it's, it's very, very evident that we are obviously having this bounce because people believe, or people think, the bottom is the previous alltime high
i personally don't think the bottom is the previous alltime high
why do i think six thousand, five hundred? uh, well, it's actually more over to it'll probably be about seventeen thousand by the time we get down here
and historically, this has always been the bottom in a mass, mass capitulation event
you know, if we extrapolate this back as well, this looks like it would have bottomed, uh, over here as well
if we look at the market structure over on the 200 week over here, in the pandemic scare, we capitulated below it
so there's, once again, a few reasons why i think 16 500 is on the table
and if we look at the total crypto market cap, yes, while bitcoin's been bouncing on the previous alltime high, basically the entire market's been moving up
so bitcoin's been moving up, the old cranes have been moving up
uh, that is very evident by looking at the fact that bitcoin's moving up, and then also looking at the fact that the total and the total two, which is the old crane market is moving up now, the alt crane market specifically
this is why the bitcoin dominance has been going down for the past two weeks
and we still do need to recognize that, well, bitcoin has been getting beaten down a little bit harder than the old cranes, and a lot of people are taking relief rallies on all cranes
we need to recognize that most all cranes are down, you know, 60, 70, 75 percent from the alltime high
and we know this because if we look at the total two, which is all the old cranes, some eyes together with 69, down from the alltime high, even after this pump
meaning if you added up all of the old cranes from the alltime high on bitcoin, they capitulated 75 collectively
so is it surprising that the bitcoin dominance is going down for two weeks or so, coming into a major area of support? it's not really surprising
did i expect it to put did i personally expect it to come down that hard? absolutely not
i was definitely not thinking it was going to come down that hard
but i was also saying when we were up here, if we do come down, as long as we hold this orange box, then we are going to be just fine
the old cranes are still in a lower, low, lower high structure
you know, for example, if i look at solana and i cut, i don't want to go into all of these old cranes and, um, take up a bunch of time
but you can see, yes, in the past week or so, old cranes have definitely been outperforming bitcoin
but, you know, they were outperforming bitcoin here, they were outperforming bitcoin here, and they were outperforming bitcoin here
what do they all have in common? from the alltime high, they are riddled with lower highs all over this chart
so i think this is just, i think that bitcoin dominus is coming back from its break
uh, i don't know myself, but if i know the bitcoin dominance, i know that it likes to take holidays for two to three weeks
and when it does come back from its holidays, it does not enjoy looking at the old cranes taking its place
so if i had to hazard a guess what is going to happen for the dominance within the next couple of weeks, i do think it's going to come back, and i think it's going to come back with a bang
what do i mean by that? i believe in the next month, in the next two weeks, really, two weeks, is kind of where i'm predicting that bitcoin is going to start to macro head down
i even think it could happen in the lower time frames, because if we do look at bitcoin, uh, bitcoin is, let me see, i think i deleted my previous chart on this, which i definitely don't want to do
nonetheless, this is what i think's going on with dominance, 786 fibonacci between the ranges of 43 to 426
and the total all crane market is still coming in to a lower high from last week
so bear in mind the price target that people are getting out of bed for on the oak cranes right now was the flood price target from last week
because, you know, two weeks ago, if you said we were coming down here, that would have been fud now, when everyone's getting out of bed for this pump, it is still, once again, a lower high
so once again, i don't think the bottom is in for all coins or btc yet
i do think we're probably gonna crab a tiny bit, and then oak cranes are gonna head for that massive leg down to 315 billion
and since i made this prediction, we have moved up a tiny bit, really not too much
so as you can see, i would be predicting for 212 billion to get wiped out of the old crane market cap, meaning a minus 40, which really isn't too hefty
i mean, it would be a free it would be down here at 315 billion, putting us just below the previous alltime high
and once again, all queens, you move a lot more euphoric than bitcoin
so seeing bitcoin capitulate below its previous alltime high should definitely mean old queen should capitulate down to this level
so that is what i think's gonna be happening for the old cranes
that's what i think's gonna be happening for the bitcoin dominance
we've probably just moved up a little bit too fast, um, a little bit too fast here
we're probably going to come back next week or the week after and slap the old cranes in the face
in these videos, i'm gonna be talking about a lot of different technical analysis patterns that i see panning out
now, if we start off on the first chart, you can see we've basically been making, uh, rising channels rising wedges, whatever you want to call them
so right off the back, we've had two of these bullish we've had two of these patterns ascending to the upside, and they've broken back down to the downside
this one would be an ascending wedge, a typical sending wedge
now, uh, on this, i do feel like the breakdown to the downside is slightly more likely for a plethora of reasons
we're going to be talking about the moving averages in a moment, but specifically for this chart, the 13 ema would be the most important
we are currently colliding to the downside of this after having a break above it and a break back down
and why is this important? if we switch back to the last couple of times that we've collided with the 13 ema, you can see we've done this time and time again since, basically, uh, 48 000
and as you can see, you know, we do it time over time over time
again, we momentarily pop above it towards the latter half of a crab market
so you can see we basically capitulate sideways for a prolonged period of time, have this cross you know, you have a few fake outs, and then you normally initiate that next leg back down to the downside
so, at least based on this chart, looking at our momentum indicators as well on the one hourly time frame, uh? and this is where it gets worrying because, well, you know, not worrying for me, necessarily, because i am hedging myself towards a move to the downside at this moment in time for one last final capitulation
but the hourly squeeze bomb is heading down, and it looks like it's heading down while we're coming into the bottom of this channel
if we extrapolate the price target of this a breakdown in the next couple of hours could pull us all the way back down to the bottom of the trend, pushing us back below 20 000
and why that's very important is because that is bitcoin's previous alltime high
if we come back for another, you know, retest of this, especially if we do it in the next two days or so, uh, then you can definitely see we'd be having our third week on the previous alltime high
and then if we do capitulate below that, 16 500 to 17 000 would be where the 300 week is coming in
and that's definitely where i could see us coming down for one last final leg
so this chart and of itself, lower time frames, they do look like they want to head down
four hourly squeeze one looks like it's, it's kind of running out of steam right now
the last four, uh, the last eight hours have been very, very flat as we are colliding to the bottom of this
so based on this chart, i moved back down to 19800, the previous alltime high, could be in play
and then, as you can see, we've got a pretty tight support floor over around about this range
and if we do capitulate below it once again, you're going to see that move below the previous alltime high, and that will induce a lot of fear in the market
this is the, this is the pattern that i was talking about that is playing out, and will play out in the next 24 hours
specifically, you know, this is going to have an apex, uh, approximately in the next, about the next 16 hours or so with this
so right off the back, the first thing that i saw this as was a typical bearish pennant
now, i'm really not even gonna focus on the price target of this, just because the price tag is down here at seven thousand
but nonetheless, if we do break below the support floor, it's going to be nasty
let's see, you see it as wonky, and you don't want to, you know, believe as the price tag would not be valid
now, once again, you can see we are basically getting slammed into this support floor as the 13 ema
this is allowing the squeeze more our momentum indicator to push to the downside
we're getting a decent amount of selling volume coming in on the four hourly time frame
and this really does not look like it wants to push us, once again, to the downside
and while, you know, most of these charts, in my opinion, they all look pretty bearish
and obviously i've been saying on my channel, i am hedging myself, uh, for one more bullet for more bearish move down to the downside
nonetheless, i do try and keep it as um as unbiased as possible, so if i do see a bullish indicator, i will speak on it
right off the back, you can see a very, very nice potential w pattern panning out right now
we're going to be talking about the inverse, head and shoulders on a different chart in one second
now, these half diamond bottoms of and half diamond tops often play out in the stock market
this is probably the best place where you can get these signals
so if i head over to the stock market, just very, very quickly, i'll show you what i mean by this
you know, you had a diamond top up here, breakdown, diamond bottom
you can see half diamond top break down, uh, break back up into a diamond top breakdown
didn't quite hit um or didn't quite come all the way back down
but nonetheless, we do see these type of patterns playing out time over time, over time
like i said, though, i do like to talk about these patterns, even if i don't necessarily believe in them
so let's move on to the next chart now, uh, the next one we're going to be talking about the head and shoulders
but right now, looking at this chart, predominantly talking about the market structure and the momentum indicators
you can see on the four hourly time frame, uh, we've poked our head above the midline, and it looks like we are getting ready for a bearish cross
now pair this with some of the other charts that we've got, this kind of pull to the downside would really start bringing everything else down
this would basically mean that the apex of this would be coming very, very soon, and we would be breaking down before we can even have a chance to shoot back up to the upside
so four hourly macd looks like it's over extended and heading down
i would also like to say, with this momentum indicator, you can often see when the macd crosses bullish and it goes for this big run up, you run above the 13 ema, just like we temporarily moved above the 13 ema here, and now the macd is starting to head down
we have a move above the 13 ema failed move, you have less momentum coming in
on the second move, you have a flip above the 13 ema and start to head down
and you can even see this flip over on the macd is even lower than this one
so, you know, we don't have a trendline for this, but a line of best fit would be a curved line, something like this
so, macd squeeze mom all of our momentum indicators really do point that we are basically exhausted and running out of steam
do the chart? does the chart agree that we are currently running out of steam? uh, well, in my opinion, yes, because what do you notice when we zoom out? i mean, sure, if you're looking at the five minute time frame, maybe the 15 minute time frame, and you're really only like, focusing on this segment of the chart, like i said, when we went back to our original bitcoin chart, you can see this as a channel heading up
and when we do zoom out, what you do notice is, you know, we are basically pumping up to the price that we were a couple of days ago
so, uh, all the way back here, 16th of june, we managed to pump up to 23 files
i could keep on going on talking about the lower highs, but let's just talk about lower time frame
now, once again, it is, i don't want to necessarily call this a confirmed lower high until we do start breaking down from some of our other chart patterns like here, which, by by the way, on the four hourly time frame
i really do think if you start pushing below twenty one thousand, twenty one thousand on the dot, i mean, if you start shifting down to twenty thousand nine hundred and twenty thousand eight hundred, you're probably going to very, very quickly fall to the downside, uh, of this channel
you're gonna invalidate any chance of having that reversal sign and then this is when you can start to see, even in the lower time frames, you would be heading down
so once again, very, very lower time frames, this is not confirmed yet
i want to see, on this chart, are we going to be heading down below the 20 000 mark? and on this previous bitcrane chart, let me reverse a few steps
uh, you can also see, looking at this on the one hourly time frame
i mean, if we draw a line like this, you can see that within the next, uh, within the next couple of hours, really, if you do shift below twenty one thousand, um, i mean, this one's twenty one thousand seventy, but let's call it twenty one thousand, uh, just in case of a wick
twenty one thousand on a lot of these charts is going to be the make or break it line where you would start capitulating and making, uh, lower lows and lower highs, even in the shorter term time frames, higher term time frames, it really does look like we are getting ready for that leg to the downside
our squeeze mom is calling, uh, squeeze one is the momentum indicator
i mean, the volume is very, very stagnant and is now stepping up with bearish volume
while we are back testing the 13 ema, which is a worrying sign, because now we've got to the point where we've flipped above the 13 ema
and if we now don't break above, i want to say 21 600, uh? but i, i prefer to say this confirmed lower high right here at 21 740
because if we come up, you know, for one last leg to the downside, if we do something like this, 21 650, and confirm like a double top structure before we start to head down, you know, i want to be prepared for a scenario like that, even if i don't think it's going to happen
i kind of think this is solidifying as the lower high already
i'm just looking at a lot of these charts, piecing it together, and it looks like we could be getting ready
the question is, what direction are we moving? in lower time frames, like the one hourly, we are already lowering down
macd on the one hourly timeframe was basically going stagnant throughout this entire move and is now pushing down to the downside
we're at one hundred and twenty six as of the time recording this
if we head down another two hundred dollars, pushing us below twenty one thousand to twenty thousand nine hundred, we're going to start invalidating a lot of these patterns, especially if we close four hourly candle, body closes the four hourly squeeze one flip before we do head over to the potential inverse head and shoulder
i want to show you the last time we had a bearish flip over here
i mean, we went from about twenty thousand two hundred down to nineteen thousand seven hundred, which, bear in mind, was a five hundred dollar price drop, uh, which would, once again, this would start putting bitcoin, uh, down below its previous alltime high, which would be a scary sight to see if you are in a long or if you are spot accumulating very, very heavily at this range
uh, that being said, what else do we have on this chart? we've covered everything from here
uh, the last major macd flip we had was back here after crossing over the 13 ema
so i want to focus on this macd flip when we were above the ema, because this was a very, very big, important, bullish, well, bearish flip
and once the macd on the four hourly time frame confirmed that we were bearish, after failing the retest of the 13 day ema, which is potentially what we're doing right now
we moved up five percent also, which i, i don't necessarily think we'll be doing this time
but nonetheless, if you do want to talk about this, you know, you can talk about this being a high, uh, or this was, you know, high, this was a low, high, low, high
so if we do come up for one last leg, you could potentially see, you know, uh, 21 500 before emming out, breaking down a lot of these macro patterns
and then that is when you start, that is when you would start to have to worry about that next leg to the downside
so the last major macd flip was all the way here, around about 30 000, and we moved to 21 000
am i saying we're gonna have another 9 000 flip to the downside with this move? absolutely not
like i've been saying, if you do watch my channel, i obviously think we're in a bear market, but i think we're in the final capitulation
and i'm hedging myself for that last move to the downside before i do start heavily, heavily going all in on bitcoin
now, like i said, even though i don't think this is going to be playing out to the teeth, i do like to talk about all the patterns that i do see, even if they don't necessarily fit my narrative
and this is one that doesn't fit my narrative, because, like i said, i believe that we're in a lower, low, low, high trajectory, and i think we're going to break down
nonetheless, this is a beautiful bottoming structure, potential bottoming structure, just like the diamond uh, the potential diamond bottom, uh, half diamond bottom, rubber that we do have playing out over on this chart
this could be a very, very interesting chart if we do come back down, uh, to the previous resistance flip support of this head and shoulders
you can see left shoulder, head, right shoulder, and we've started to break up
if we come down, technically, 20 600 could be a very, very important pivotal zone that bitcoin would need to hold
so 20 600, if we do hold that, obviously i can't rule out the possibility of a move back up to the upside
but pairing this with all the other charts that we've got, we would be heavily breaking down after this point
this would be another zone that you need to hold on this time frame
once again, 21 000, which perfectly lines up with what we've got going over on this half potential, half diamond bottom, uh, slash, you know, ascending asymmetrical type triangle
momentum indicators are calling for another move to the downside
i think the momentum indicators, well, i know squeeze one, macd, they are all calling for a big move back down
well, lower time frames are calling for a somewhat okay ish move back down to the downside, a couple of hundred dollars or so, you can expect
but then, with that couple of hundred dollar flip back down to the downside, as you're already seeing, the four hourly squeeze bomb completely flashing out
if, in the next four hours we start dropping a couple of hundred dollars down to twenty thousand seven hundred, twenty thousand eight hundred, whatever it will be, you are gonna see the four hourly macd flip very, very bearish with that
that is going to probably cancel out the, uh, shortterm bullish structure that we've been seeing
and these two last lines in the sand, the last one being at 20 600, which correlates to the potential back test of this inverse head and shoulders
and as you can see, if we do slowly, slowly trickle down to 20 600, and we do not hold it
you know, if we have a dead cat bounce, potentially something like this, retest the 13 ema and then start to head down, you are probably going to see the market structure head down to that one last leg to the downside
so that's all i've got for this bitcoin chart, uh, specifically in the higher time frames, because i haven't necessarily given uh too much, uh, i haven't necessarily explained too much where my price targets are at this moment in time
so this would be a 13 drop down to the uh, basically one of the final cme gaps that we've got at 18 hundred
we've filled these other ones, so, you know, we filled twenty four thousand six hundred
no one thought we were going to do this when we were heading up at twenty, uh, twenty six thousand
but now it's looking likely that eighteen thousand five hundred could be one of the um could be one of the prices that we're going to magnetize to
probably by next week we are going to be moving up, because this is the 300 week moving average
and i really don't need to tell you that down here at the 300 week when this started loading in, you know, we were taking in, we're currently taking in data points from 13 800, and we're replacing them with data points, uh, from i'll know, is it? no, this is not thirteen thousand
so we're replacing price targets around one thousand three hundred, one thousand four hundred, and we're replacing them with price targets up here at 21 000, every single week
so with that being said, obviously this is going to continue to very, very quickly move to the upside
you can basically see this never really starts to move back down
and that makes sense, because you're taking in data points from 300 weeks
so even when you have like a year or two bear market, it's not enough time to push this back down to the downside
that being said, that is all i've got for you for today's video
if we start breaking below there, it's probably going to get very, very nasty
and then your last line in the sand, twenty thousand six hundred, i talked about this on a range of different charts, is going to be coming into fruition
twenty thousand six hundred breaks your short term price targets
would like, i said, down here at nineteen thousand eight hundred, but the start of this trend was 19700, that would be in play
and then once you do come down to there, you are going to be, once again, knocking on the door of bitcoin's previous alltime high
so what i've got for you today, as always, no financial advice
so the bitcoin price is twenty thousand nine hundred and sixty six dollars
as you can see from the tile that i gave there, is the next upcoming move
so crypto's next move? we're pretty much right at a very pivotal point where, yeah, i mean, it's anybody's game
i still lean more towards the bearish side, but there really is a chance for bulls to flip things and reverse the entire trend, at least on a fourhour chart, which is the lowest time frame that i personally pay attention to
so if you have a look over here, as i put in the thumbnail today, you got the hammer
i don't know if the hammer is going to help to knock the price down, because i still am hoping to buy, uh, lower, for spot positions at least
but you know what? i am a trader at the end of the day, and the trend is your friend till the end of the trend
so if this trend does end, i'll be looking to recapture the next higher low
and i will give you an idea of what that will look like in a moment
but nevertheless, where is your invalidation level? at what point would i say, okay, uh, it looks like the bears have lost this one
and that would essentially be once we cross this level over here, once you start clearing above that box
so if price manages to start closing four hour candles above twenty one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars, pretty much, you can close a couple of four hour candles there, and they're not wicks, then i would say, okay, great
we've broken this trend line over here, and we may be looking at um higher prices
however, you can see that on the four hour chart, your momentum oscillators are starting to turn down
so price would really need to start moving up quickly in order to keep these momentum oscillators to the upside, and therefore to reverse the trend
but you know what, even if it does break up over here, because they are extended, they are going to have to come back down, and that will still give you an opportunity to get in lower
now, a lot of people are looking at this sort of picture over here
they're kind of watching this as some sort of an inverse head and shoulders
but then this would be your neckline breakout, right? it's usually preferable
the ultimate pattern would be if it's more horizontal like that, because then you just have an easy invalidation to say if you're wrong or not
and look, what is the what is the possible situation or scenario should this play out in the bulls favor? okay, well i would look for something like this, right? let's say we break up there, come back down, retest that trend line, use that trend line to push up off
as a bull, probably it would shoot up quite quick because i think there would be a bit of a short squeeze there
most of the shorts stops are going to be in this region over here
and then you'd be watching for price to come back down, and then probably test some sort of a horizontal here to form your next higher low relative to that area over there
and what does that mean? that means there is no point in fomoing in right now, because essentially you're most likely gonna get your entries in exactly the same place
however, if it plays out in the best way, what would happen is we pretty much have to turn right from here, establish a new low
whether we make a low relative to that one, i'm impartial to i can't say that yet
price will come back into the 18k region, and then that will be your opportunity to start again, if you decide you want to to load up on spot positions
so that's basically what i'm looking at on that particular chart
and i did mention this, by the way, on my twitter, so please make sure that you follow me on twitter
the link is in the description below over there, if you want to make sure you get to the right one, since there are scam accounts
i put all of my thoughts and my charts up on twitter pretty much straight after the show, so that you have the exact levels that i am looking at
same story, unless you clear this area over here, which was your previous lower high, therefore making a new high high
the hidden bearish divergence is still something that could potentially play out
so i'll be waiting for that ethereum, looks pretty much exactly the same, right? so everything is in a, i would call it a do or die situation right now
they need to move this over the course of today and this weekend
you can expect price will hammer up against that and start to roll over
and then next week there would be some sort of an acceleration
and with that being said, i mean, look, i still do back this chart over here, as uh as strange as it seems, um
you would have ever thought in my life i'd be talking about planetary movements using that in charts? i personally didn't
but if that happens, look, you got your the this diagonal trendline that's been governing the higher lows
your best case scenario as a bull would be pushing up with a mean reversion, trade straight into that trend line
but you have to ask yourself, what is the risk to reward right now whether you're going to go long or short? right? so if you do go along, let's say you go along right here, what is your risk to reward to the upside before you're going to hit resistance
if you go and you play the downside move, what is your risk to reward to go back into the 18k region? well, that's going to be about 15 20
which means that currently where we're sitting is, in my opinion, more of a no trade zone
we could make new lows, but things are really, really getting overextended at this point
so, and that's why you can see, if you have a look at the bollinger bands, you can see them starting to contract and squeeze
that shows that the market is really evenly split, right? there's a lot of indecision
a lot of people are flipping bullish, other people are still remaining bearish
and because of that indecision, it's like a tug of war, right? pulling each way
uh, the bollinger bands start to contract, and volatility will be imminent
whether that happens next week, because these can, these can, uh, curl in a lot more
you can start to see something like this, like that over there, where it starts to really no wedge price starts to wedge into a small gap like that
and then we have the quarterly closeouts and everything that's taking place
all these important macro events are going to start to unfold over the course of next week
so if you want the safe and obvious trade, if you're a leveraged trader, well, then it's probably best to maybe just sit this one out at the time being and wait till you have more clarification of what is coming next
so with that being said, i did want to let's quickly also look at the traditional markets over here
so look, it's still got a little, a couple of weeks to unfold
if this, the nasdaq, was to push back up, like our old drawings over there, i'm actually just going to delete them quick but if price is to push up over here, form the next lower high and reject down, you can see this can still all play out over possibly even another quarter
and yeah, i'm personally just waiting for, you know, a bit more clarity
still sticking with the same target, ultimately, the precovered levels on the nasdaq at 235
you got the dexi over here, which is come back into the range
it is creating a slight deviation, meaning that it's peaked its head above the previous level, and it's come back down
it has wicked below the previous support, but come back up, and now it's holding that
so i i did mention this actually a couple of weeks ago, or days ago
i said, look, you know what's going to happen is most of these traditional markets, including the dexy, the nasdaq, all of that, is most likely going to kind of consolidate within this region
but at the end of the day, remember, with this nasdaq, you do have a series here of higher lows throughout
so consolidation over here would still mean a most likely breakout to the upside, which would not be good for risk on assets, necessarily
now, uh, yesterday i did want to touch on this a little bit more, but i had some technical issues, so i had to cut the stream short
we have this chart over here, which is the bitcoin, uh, chart between price on a weekly and what you can have a look at over here is, historically this two orange 255 ma has been a very, very important level
let's say you have a spare 500 or a thousand dollars per month in which you're able to invest
and the reason that i say that is because, of course, this area is typically held the 255 plus
you have this horizontal level, which it is price is respecting
and if you lose that, from a longterm perspective, if you're going to be dollar cost averaging, then the next key yearly level, which is a lot of confluence, is coming in at 13 880
so i'm not telling all of you to completely remain out of the market
you'll actually find that if you dollar cost average, uh, with great discipline, over time, you'll probably outperform the majority of top traders in the world, believe it or not, as a dollar cost average
this is what trading comes down to, as well as investing, is back testing a strategy and knowing that you have a solid plan and solution, as opposed to just winging it, you know, going into a trade every single day and just hoping that it works out
now, look what you do want to see those, these moving averages, start to turn up
so if you see something like this, even as a longterm investor, let's quickly grab the pin over here
so if you start to see these start curling down like that, that would be a huge, huge red flag for me, which is why i say be cautious
even if you are trying to buy the dips, rather do it as a dollar cost average, instead of just like, going all in
i just kind of want to get it over and done with and just go in with the whole lump sum
stick with a disciplined plan, and i'm sure in the long run, you will be more than okay
and then all the links are below you got my instagram, my twitter, as well as the vibet and the newsletter link over there
i will definitely keep you up to date over the course of the weekend
i'll be looking for more clear signs and a better opportunity to get in

[Music], what's up the legends? in this episode, we're going to take a look at their bitcoin price on the one hourly chart
and i just want to do a recap of what has been happening in the last few days and what could happen in the next coming hours and days
also, shorting here at this level, longing at this range, also taking profits from this short, actually taking 50 of this other long position, totally protected
and i'm going to explain why i did enter a short hedge position against this long that i do have already protected
all right, just in case the market does roll down, and this inverse head and shoulder that everyone is talking about right now is probably not going to play out, and we're actually going to go down from these levels, i'm going to explain my strategy and explain the potential scenarios that could happen, where the price could stop, where the price could bounce from, guys
i am not a financial advisor, so do not buy or sell anything that i say
want to explain the levels, why i've got these levels, and why they have been respecting very, very much
all right, now let's just go here from 21st of june, because i've had a pretty nice training week
why did we? why did i short it? why did i explain this short position on the livestream on the 21st of june? well, it's because we were hitting this big, major resistance level, as you can see, getting that reaction, also getting the resistance, all right, from this lower high trend line, hitting this level, looking for lower from this high point, looking for actually that twenty thousand four hundred dollar range, protecting position, taking profits and actually closing all of the position when i had all of this consolidation
why did we hit resistance? like i showed you right over here? because we had several touches
okay? we've got the higher highs, higher highs, higher highs, higher lows
um also, what else it is the value area high from the volume traded, all right, the last 10 days, 10, 15 days, approximately
as you can see, in the month of june, value area high is at this 21 400 range
value area low is round about the nineteen thousand, okay? eight hundred, nineteen thousand, nine hundred, right where their volume, you know, suddenly disappears
this is the value low, evaluate high, where you will get very much respected
so this is why i did short here, the reason why i took all of the profits because, you know, we were forming a kind of a, you know, big consolidation, kind of a diamond bottom pattern here, reversal
and we're already hitting, you know, the fifty percent fibonacci almost at fifty percent
and i was planning to add into my position here, into a long position, and plan to add, okay, if we were going to correct back down, because i knew there was a lot of support, and we were very likely going to create a high low from this zone
so i did risk less than one percent of my, of my capital, and was ready to add up to my position if we were going to have a consolidation lower
are we going to manage to pump from this range? now, there is one thing that is happening
we are actually not breaking successfully from this resistance trend line from the lower highs
so the probabilities in actually getting rejected here after multiple attempts are still, you know, are very, very high the longer time we are here
i'm more, you know, the more the exhaustion it is for the ball
so the possibility in actually dropping from this range, you know, is very, very possible
but from this level, we should be dropping to much lower levels, well below twenty thousand dollars
we actually hit from this high point to the lows, the point 88 fibonacci retracement
and when, when i when when i see a price hit a 088? all right, on the retracement, i directly think, in harmonic pattern
from this point, this point over here, almost hitting the 50 fibonacci retracement here, hitting the point 88, right there
all right, 618 levels approximately on this big, massive drop that could potentially happen
now, if we do drop to these lows and actually break this low, it is very, very likely that this is finally going to come down to the d point here, to the point 6187
now, the reason why that, whether we do have a projected move here, is the expansion from this b point, okay, to the c point, the point one six one eight, very famous
expansion from a potential consolidation and a break down from a low, okay? point six one eight, which would be around about the eighteen thousand six hundred, eighteen thousand seven hundred dollar range, um
so this is, you know, this is the thing i'm going to explain why i am in a hedge position
and this is a winwin, because i am in a long and i'm, i am in a short right now
okay, this short position is to hedge, all right, against this long just in case i do get stopped out at break even and we do have that leg, leg to the downside
now, my stop loss from this short position is just above this range, slightly above, because if we do attempt to break this height, it is very, very likely we're gonna see that pump, potentially to twenty two thousand five hundred dollars
that i do explain why i think we could hit that level in today's live stream, if you haven't checked it out, check out today's live stream
and, um, so this is what i'm looking for if i do get stopped out
i have entered here around about the twenty one thousand one hundred dollar range, as you can see here on by bit
i d i am in this short position currently at my entry point, almost
and you know, this is a hedge position, just in case we do get that drop
okay? if we do start pumping, i will get stopped out, that is totally fine
i will be riding still the long position that i did enter here

it's another way to support the channel, but you get the best bonus available on buybit, my favorite swing trading platform
this is gonna basically be it for the next coming hours and days
we either have an explosive move to the upside after this consolidation, hitting potentially, you know, the 22 500 range, which is a major daily zone
we also got a nice resistance here, so it's very possible we will be consolidating there for quite a few hours
we can check this tomorrow to see what has happened, or we can either start correcting here to complete this gartley pattern
all right, could potentially even dropping below the 19 400 right range, where we do have some strong support
okay? we might be holding this range for a little bit and maybe continue back down
and here is where i would be looking for potential long opportunities
at the point 78 fibonacci, from this low to the high is where i would be looking for long opportunities
now there will be a stop, definitely, if we start rolling down here at the nineteen thousand four hundred dollars
all depending on if it's going to be a big, big consolidation and multiple attempts here to break lower, then i would be interested in longing
okay, from this guardly harmonic pattern, which is at 078, range, 18 450
if we were to have that drop, like i showed you in today's stream, we do have two days to make it a one to one, so there's plenty of time to roll down here in the next couple of days to complete that harmonic pattern
now, if we do not drop from this low, and we start pumping, then absolutely beautiful
if we do hit this high, it is very, very likely that we are actually going to continue back up
this is why i do got, i do have a stop loss at this level from my short position
because if we do come all the way up here, it's very unlikely that we are going to create a double top, because we're already going to be above the value area high here from this range
and we already, you know, breaking the lower high from this resistance trend line
so it's very, very likely that you are going to have that continuation to the upside if this does happen

how is everyone doing? i'm just going to go quickly through the comment section right away, just to say a quick hello
and check out, you know, where could we find these good trading opportunities, guys? because if we do get that pump, we do know that a lot of people are going to get excited, but it probably is going to be a big, massive bull trap
and we want to be the first and jumping in for a potential shorting opportunity when we are going to get most of the people extremely bullish once we break this kind of descending neckline
okay, i can see a lot of people talking about this right now, but there is, you know, i think they do not know
okay, a lot of them are talking about this projected move right where we do have the kind of head right to, you know, from the breakout or the neckline, we should be going to 25 000
of course, if we do get that pump, guys, because we are currently hitting a bunch of resistance right now, we could actually go down from these levels
so if we do have that breakout, you know, i'm going to talk about some major resistance levels, guys
okay? and at the beginning of the stream, we need to be ready to see how we're going to react to this major range that i'm going to talk about in today's episode, just in case we do get that pump, guys
because if we do get that pump, a lot of people are going to rush in
a lot of people are going to start longing, and it's very likely that we're going to get rejected heavily at this zone that i'm going to explain in today's live stream
first of all, going through the comment section, saying hello to my moderators
all right, we've got the bitcoin dominance all right, something that i wanted to talk about also, we got the bitcoin dominance hitting this major support level
now we can take a look at the bitcoin dominance also, but if this level is lost on the bitcoin dominance, you know, we could see that, you know, the bit, you know, all coins actually popping
we just have a little bit of volatility here at this level, and the bitcoin dominance is going to continue back up in the next coming weeks
well, i'll leave xrp here, ready, and i'll go through the comment section quickly
i want to say hello, because a lot of the times i just leave the comment leave the comment section and just talk and talk and do analysis
first of all, xrp is having a pretty intensive pump at this moment
very likely we were creating some big, big bullish diversions with these lower lows
i would say i think there is a higher probability in us having a pump, and i'm going to talk about what major levels right away
first of all, where could that pump go to? where could that pump get rejected? this is what we are interested we do not care if we are going to pump or we are going to dump
what we want to know is, where is the highest probability zone where we can take a trade and make some gains, right? simple as i don't care
they want to be ready once you hit a certain good price level with a lot of confluence, where you could get a bounce or you could get rejected
how are you doing? jake? how are you doing? jake? marios eliza, hello, hello
uh, i've closed 50 on my trades because we've hitting a long, uh, big resistance
you know, i'm in a free trade just in case we do get that bull trap, that big momentum to the upside, which i will be taking rest of my profits from this, you know, right shoulder scenario, let's make some gains
i mean, i'm not gonna say hello to everyone, because if not, this stream is just gonna be saying hello and how is everyone doing? scotty, how are you i can see you there
ghost what's up? uh, where are we entering a trade? very good question
okay, because obviously, longing this range is extremely risky, because we are hitting resistance right now from these lower highs
we are basically at the value area high from the point of control right over here
okay? this is where we actually got this bounce, right? value area low, from this big, nice mountain
you always have a value area high and a value area low from that trading zone, which is usually big resistance or support if you are inside of this zone
i mean, the reason why i did enter a long position here is because we were already hitting, you know, almost a 50 level
it was less than one percent of my capital, and i was planning to see if we were going to come down and have a reaction, and i was going to ladder into my position, you know, risking one 15 percent
okay? so i can ladder down this position if we did have that reaction, because i was very much concerned that this probably was going to be the low right over here, and we were going to have this move to the upside um
i there was two scenarios when we were taking a look at the charts, okay, yesterday that i talked on the live stream, we either go from this level, we'll go all the way up here to this lower, high neckline
you can check the stream, or we either come down, consolidate and come back up
so, you know, these were the two scenarios with high probability that i was looking for
so this is why, you know, i entered a small position already here at this, you know, twenty thousand low, twenty thousand dollar area, um
so, yeah, anyway, we talk, we're going to talk about the resistance levels right now
i think there's slightly high probability, not much, slightly high probability, that we are going to break resistance right now, in the next coming hours
of course, there is the scenario that we might get rejected from this level
but what i want to show you right there is the big resistance zone that i do see us getting a massive rejection
so the price of bitcoin were to break out from this level, we know that a lot of people are going to fomo
we're going to see a lot of bullish, you know, influencers out there
what major resistance? you know, we can see here that the price of bitcoin, let me just get the svp out of the way, and, um, right over here, we did have a big resistance and support zone
okay, where is this zone? this zone is in between twenty two thousand five hundred and twenty two thousand eight hundred, approximately
right? eight hundred nine hundred, i would give four hundred dollars of volatility
so between two, twenty two thousand five hundred and twenty two thousand 900 approximately
you can either even go higher than that range and then get the the reaction, then get the the consolidation after having that volatility
why are these so important levels? well, let me just go over here on the daily chart
uh, also they have been respected with, um, you know, these bouncers that we have had
and another major daily zone is this one right over here, guys
i just marked this one this morning, uh, where we did have a large, you know, daily, open, close, open, close and open, right over here, at around about that 22 500 range
this was exactly on the 14th, 15th and 16th, right? it's a major, major zone there
but once you claim here this, you know, supply zone, then, you know, it's, it's just very, very likely you're going to get a consolidation at that range
you're going to see some wicks, and it's very likely going to turn back down
that is what i think is going to happen, um, because it looks such a strong, strong level
all right, so it's a major daily level, also created here on the 14th, 15th and 16th
we've got two dailies where you could get that liquidity grab right, that reaction, you know, to claim these highs to potentially continue back down
if we will reach, you know, 22 000, 500, 22 700 in the next coming hours, a couple of days, we're gonna see a lot of people bullish, guys
and this will be the moment that we will have to, i'm gonna potentially short, okay, of course, only if we stop, only if we get a reaction
because if we do get a big pump to that level, um, you know, aggressively, you could get in, because you might just pump and dump from that range
i think, um, a reaction of at least, you know, four to eight hours is very, very likely
and and then potentially, potentially take the trade, because you can slice through these levels
remember, you know, catching a a big, major pump for a short, or a massive, big falling knife to try and catch the bottom, you're just gonna get burnt
it's always safer, all right? to see a reaction, to know that that level is being defended and then jump in a trade, right? so, i mean, just a few tips here guys
okay, how's going on? what's going on? is there anything going on? thanks andy for your simple inch perfect analysis
um, let's take a look, you know, at bitcoin, also analyze that situation, because there is also, i'm talking, i'm taking a look right now at the short term bullish scenario, which would be breaking here, uh, this, uh, you know, lower high resistance
but there's always, you know, there's also this scenario, you know, that we're not going to break above this value area high
value area low from this mountain, valley, area high from this mountain
if we start losing this low, it's going to be looking pretty pretty scary, right? we can actually come as low as the 18 000 range
so, you know, but i think there's just a slightly higher probability before continuing down
i think we need a pump to this zone, get people a little bit extremely bullish, and and then, you know, look for that, you know, short to make some gains, uh? but anyway, that's just pure speculation at this moment
till we get that pump and hit this level, then, um, yeah, this is just pure speculation, because we could, you know, we are hitting resistance levels right now, and you could actually roll down
i think the market makers are going to give, you know, are going to give this to to most of the people that are watching
uh, you know, just, we're looking for that leg, just push up to the upside
you know, get people extremely bullish, thinking that we are going to go to the 25 000, get people rushing into long positions, and then have that reaction and roll back down aggressively
i think this is very much the, the the kind of scenario that is is likely to happen, or no breakout, and you just roll, roll down from this level, because this is strong resistance
but i am looking for a short position here at the 22, 500, 222 900 range
so this right over here is a risky level, because you're hitting resistance
you can either roll down from this, or, because of this kind of setup, you can actually make that pump
what i'm more interested is in this level over here for a short, for a long position
we do have this level over here, which is, i mean, this would be, we're probably going to be forming a beautiful harmonic pattern here
but, um, like i said, i would be looking for this daily resistance level
you know, we're looking for shorts, looking for short levels and looking for long levels
so where could we get that bounce for a long position? we talked about this daily level
and, like i said, you know, i take, you know, 5, 10, 15 trades a month
i'm going to be trying trading much more on the, on the world series of trading competition, uh, just because of the sake of the competition, of course
i mean, this is a major daily, daily level right over here, the 400 dollars
well, i do think, you know, we have, we have had resistance and support, okay, once we got above this range
this is the 19 dollar range, okay, plus minus, you know, fifty dollars approximately
it's a major daily level from back of, um, this was, uh, december of 2020
we can just zoom out and confirm why we do have this daily level
if we were to have that drop from this level, taking look at the lows to the highs right there
you know, also in between, in between 19600 and, you know, obviously, i think we would be losing this low, of course, if we do start rolling back down from this range
um, yeah, where we do have the daily levels, also, the daily level and the price action showing you resistance
so in between nineteen thousand dollars and nineteen thousand four hundred is a major zone of potentially support, where you could see the price action getting a reaction from this range, in between the daily levels, in between the resistance of the price action, in between the 618, from this big, major pump that we've had, all right, from the 18th of june to the 21st
this might just be an abc correction, and we might be forming a harmonic pattern right over here
i need, i would have to check with the fibonacci levels, but, um, yeah, you could be forming a harmonic right there also
so if you start losing this range over here, you know, um, it wouldn't be a garlic at the seven eight because, uh, it could actually, you're about round about 50, almost 50 fib level
so if you do lose, if you do lose? if you do lose, just let me check with fibonacci time here one second
because what we want to do on an ideal harmonic is the timing in between x, a to b, you want the same timing from b to c to d, right? this movement over here, you want the exact same time, okay? in price action, obviously, to the d point down there
so taking that fib time, you know, from x here, the lowest point, to this b zone right there, which is the lowest point that was created on the 22nd of june
you know, a onetoone extension would be all the way here till the 26th of june
what happens if we do not get a reaction from this level? because i am only interested, guys, this is super important
only interested in long in here, in between nineteen thousand and nineteen thousand four hundred, okay, where we have the daily level resistance on the price action, that should be turning into support
only if we do get a reaction at that level, guys, because we could fall pretty aggressively, you know, in the next two days, you know, to complete this harmonic pattern, um, you know, hitting the seven, eight, which would be, uh, you know, the gartley um, uh, target for the d point, for a potential longing opportunity
we've got two days for this to complete and price action bitcoin right now, you know, we got the bullish scenario in the short term, where we do have very strong resistance levels
and we do have, you know, bearish case scenario right from this range, where we do that we are hitting resistance
you know, it is up to you at this level, but this is not a range that i am interested in trading
i'm not interested in trading this range because i do see that potential breakout into the to the upside, or, and i also see this major, you know, roll back down
this is why i did long here, also longing right over here on the you know, i was waiting to add to a position here, so it's a very small position, very insignificant
you know that i did to take from this right shoulder, right the right shoulder, from the inverse, head and shoulder, entering out there, twenty thousand eighty one dollars, approximately
guys, remember, if you are interested in trading on buybit, you haven't got a buy bit account, and you are interested and you are experienced, down below, you get an insane bonus of up to four thousand and fifty dollars
okay? you need to follow, you know, the steps to get this bonus at the rewards hub
primex bt, you can use bitcoin and other crypto as collateral, such as ethereum and stable coins
and you can trade over 50 assets, not only crypto, forex, oil, gold, you name it
and you can use crypto as collateral, which is absolutely phenomenal
this is my platform to, you know, accumulate as much bitcoin as i can
this is, these are my two favorite trading platforms, bibit and primex bt, the ones that i use most of the times
just want to show you that down below, you do get a huge bonus, seven percent added to your deposit, up to seven thousand dollars on primex bt
guys, let's take a look at, um, you know, what we were talking about here on bitcoin, because i'm focusing more on bitcoin guys
i will take a look at the comment section to take a look at some altcoins, i promise
um, i got scotty here saying, candy, can you check evacs please? absolutely
but then, just focusing on bitcoin, the potential rejection from this level right now is is very, very real
but if we do roll back down, guys, you know, we might be falling pretty aggressively
and if we do not get this stop here, from this nineteen thousand four hundred, nineteen thousand one hundred dollar range, then, you know, i am looking for that d point here, the seven eight um, the seven eight, for that gartley, bullish gartley pattern
and this would be, in two days, we might be falling aggressively
in two days, we should be getting a stop at this, you know, seven eight fibonacci, and probably going to get a big bounce from this level, guys
this would be a high probability trade, in my opinion, uh, which we will be taking a look in the next coming days
where, where am i going to take the trade? where do i take the trade? only at the reaction
only at the reaction, only at the reaction, only at the reaction
i was ready for lower, but i was also ready for this kind of move to the upside
i jump in when i see a consolidation for a potential reversal
i'm riding a free trade, waiting patiently for those reaction, guys
there's so many different ways of trading, right? let's take a look at um
well, well, well, um, let's take a look at, i will just, i will leave this down here so we don't have too much stuff on the chart
um, stay cautious with them, with all coins, because if bitcoin starts rolling down, and the bitcoin dominance, the bitcoin dominance, starts pumping from this range
okay, we might see some volatility here at this major resistance on the bitcoin dominance
we are in a corrective wave, guys, from this uptrend, breaking a major resistance, low high
all coins, all coins are pumping right now from the big, massive drop that we've had for the last few days
so if we take a look at avax, you know, we're probably going to have that reverse on the bitcoin dominance
with bitcoin, you know, maybe is gonna, is gonna continue down
and also, you know, a lot of all coins will be facing major resistance
and if we do take a look at avax here, this is on the daily chart, um, not much to add here
you know, zooming out, almost coming down to retest the summer lows of 2021
but, but, but, um, we had this kind of descending triangle scenario
we didn't have a successful breakout, not even managing to get above the last lower high right over here
very important from a breakout, you know, to get above the last lower high from the resistance trend line, right? you did see this move to the upside, you know, crashing at the highs here, not even reaching the heights, coming back down, and then seeing this kind of momentum to the downside on avax
to keep it pretty simple, we got huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge um resistance here
okay, give or take, you know, a couple of dollars because of the volatility
so we've got three major touches here, in between 21 and 23 dollars on avax
looking at the fourhour elite, what is happening right now? you know, you're having this kind of double bottom scenario, a little bit of price action to the upside
looking at the bitcoin dominance, looking at, you know, the ideal scenario would be, would be guys to get into a trade if bitcoin does manage to pump in the next coming hours
i mean, and this is super important, guys, we need to jump from bitcoin to altcoin, from awkward to bitcoin, to the bitcoin dominance to all coins, because this is how you can, you know, get the highest probability trade
so, if bitcoin did have this massive pump to this, well, it's not a massive pump
it is for us nowadays, you know, it's only a, uh, was it a 1 600 pump? you know, that is nothing on bitcoin, uh, but it is huge at this moment
if we were to have that pump and get a consolidation and a big, big, massive rejection from this range, um, we will see some all coins popping
so on avax, you know, we're probably going to get that 21, 23, um, touch here
if bitcoin pumps, you know, that would only be about a two dollar pump here on avax, two three dollar pump
and of course, we are looking for bitcoin to get that major reaction from this level, right? this major daily zone
it's the highs that we did create here on the 14th, you know, 15, 16th of june, right here, as you can see
so if we have that pump, and i am looking here for bitcoin to get absolutely, you know, um, dumped on this major level, a big, big, big rejection from this, this zone when a lot of people will be bullish
we'll be hitting some resistance levels, right? i would, i would assume that avax would reach round about the 21 23 range if bitcoin does manage to hit that, um, that 225 k level
we need to see if there's more confluence, because not just because of these three touches, i would enter a short maybe, yes
where does the dump start? you know, the dump starts, doesn't start here
it starts from this one, right? because we didn't have a proper big retracement
so not a good fib level would be from this level, from that range
here what is happening right now? we are getting a small reaction from the 382
we are slightly above that range, slightly above at this moment
but where is the 618? it is at the 224 so 20, 208 is the 50 fibonacci level, and the 618 is the 2244, where we have seen the price action react several times
okay, so we've got fibonacci confluence number two, one of my favorites
you know, this looks very interesting because we are, there's no volume traded here for the last, uh, over a month
as you can see on the vpvr, we've created a pretty nice um volume profile right there
we've got the highest point of control here at 245, but the value area low here, from this volume profile, is exactly right there
so, i mean, that 22 23 on avax is is a very likely, must kind of short position, right? especially if you do get that consolidation, especially if you do get that reaction
so if we do get that consolidation, it will confirm that the bet the balls are getting exhausted
and, um, that would be the ideal scenario, if we were to have that bump on bitcoin
of course, like i said, you know, this is only a little bit of speculation
we need to have those levels marked up, because we don't know if this level could, could actually get rejected from this range, because we are hitting major resistance
value area low is at around about the 20 thousand dollar levels
value area high is around about the 21 321 500 right? give or take a few hundred dollars
and your question might be, why aren't you shorting it there? why aren't you shorting this big resistance? because of this scenario
because of this bullish potential pattern, this potential reversal scenario
maybe for a lot of you, is going to be, you know, this is going to dump, or this is going to pump
you know, maybe maybe some of you are pretty sure, but not me
at this level, i would be more sure here that with the price will get rejected, or more sure that the price will, um, get a bounce from this level here
and remember, when when trading, we're just looking for the highest probability trades
if you're randomly, you know, entering here, for me, you are entering a 50 50 trade
of course, you know, you might have another analysis, you might see the chart in another way
i mean, i want to do for a little bit of not and this is not even full analysis, but, you know, just take her some time to take a look at the charts because, um, yeah, it's, it's important to to to be five, ten minutes at least to take a look at some major levels
i'm just gonna check the mods chat here, just in case i do have, i know, i got a super chat, right? now
um, but i just need to read this from my chat work, right right? yeah
i feel just, i feel like crying right now because, you know, 500 people, 140 likes
uh, looking at probabilities, being an analyst, i'm, yeah, i'm telling you right now, there's a very low probability that we will be hitting almost 500 likes in the next five minutes
but anyway, even though you listen to it, you know, it's incredible human reaction, how we react
let's um take a look at, let's take a look at the super yeah, i've seen the super chat already
after doing my full analysis and point of view on bitcoin, guys, i can't go more into depth of what i've, uh, what i see on bitcoin in this live stream
you know, i've been taking a look at the big resistance zones where i do think we can get rejected
and i've also shown you, you know, big support levels, a potential harmonic pattern that can be created
okay? you can speculate, also, guys, if you are, you know, willing to to risk here, you know, you can speculate that we are potentially going to be forming a harmonic pattern here that can come even below the nineteen thousand dollars
and, you know, there is a good risk to reward there, because if we start dropping from this range, it's very unlikely we're going to lose this low
it's very like likely that we are going to start, you know, having that volatility at this nineteen thousand four hundred dollar range
you know, you can dip below, hold the range, have that volatility, you know, potentially to complete this, uh, harmonic pattern, which is a gartly pattern
you know, your stoploss should be at least above this high zone
it would have been ideal at the very top here, from this consolidation, try and get at the highest point possible
but anyway, i mean, this is the thing, i, i'm not interested in this, i'm not interested in this short
but if it does play out, you know, for the next coming days, um, you know, you got a pretty nice risk to reward ratio right there
as soon as you start hitting that nineteen thousand four hundred dollars with a volatility and getting a reaction, you get out of that trade
you get out you definitely protect your position, but it's a pretty good risk to reward
you know, it's at least a four, four to one risk to reward right there
i would be trading this zone here for a short or this zone here for a long guys
um, mentioned yesterday why i entered we were at the value area, low
i was ready to be a negative, just in case we were to come lower
i mean, that would have been the ideal scenario, right there, and then getting the move up, you know, getting ready for that momentum, hitting the 618, from the high, low to the high, hitting the resistance support here that we did have, turning into support
this is why i was, you know, planning to ladder in a position here
i'm gonna go through that super chat right right away, and nil
but i want to ask the community right now, i mean, this is a critical zone, guys
we do know there are a lot of influences, a lot of people on twitter, a lot of people out there talking about this inverse head and shoulder scenario
even my mum's talking about this inverse head and shoulder on the chart, and she doesn't even trade, um
but then, and this is the thing, when most of the people talk about it, it's it's possible that you it's not going to play out
this is why, you know, harmonic padding here is the second option
will the bitcoin price pump in the next coming days? right in the next couple of days, coming days, will the bitcoin price pump in the next coming days? guys, today, tomorrow? let me know in the poll right away
maybe a lot of people are saying there's no way bitcoin is going to pump from this range
it's going to get absolutely rejected from this zone and going to continue back down
we've got, you know, a couple of touches as resistance and volatility
so anyway, let's go through this superchat here that i do have right away
um, best example that i could give you right here, there are fibonacci movements that do create a kind of a pattern
and they do have, um, you know, animal names, such as a bullish bat pattern, or a bullish altback pattern, or a hum or, a bullish gauntlet, a crab shark pattern
you know, they are, and they all work with fibonacci numbers, okay? they all move related to fibonacci numbers, and that's how you can have, you know, that harmonic pattern, basically
and, you know, just, that was a pretty nice question, and i'm gonna be, you know, just going to explain, uh, what? what potential harmonic heat do we have here is a gartly pattern okay, maybe forming, all right, maybe forming a potential garlic pattern right over here
this is the one that i explained before, right? which would be from this low to this high to almost the 50 fib levels right there, to almost, you know, the point 88
you know, you could even have one last leg up, but it's hitting around about the point zero eight, uh? 81
that needs to be, you know, these can differ a little bit in between the three, eight, two and the six, one, eight, the b point, and also the c point can differ from the 382 to the point 88 fib fibonacci retracement
so it can be from here, or it can be here, or it can be all the way up to the point 88
the most important one where you should be getting a stop is at 078 fib levels, from this low to this high
and this is why, you know, i, you know, i do see a potential harmonic playing out here
if we do have that drop, okay, losing the b point, getting a bunch of liquidity from these lows, people expecting we're gonna go higher, we have the price action coming down to catch a huge amount of stops
below this b point, getting a massive drop, getting everyone extremely scared, almost retesting the x point
but you get a bounce at the 0782, 782, which is an important um fibonacci, that's at 078
hey, andy, when you will release a ta course, please provide top courses you have done and books you have read, read for improving ta
okay, please provide top courses you have done and books you have read for improving ta
and you actually come out, you know, a lot of courses talk about harmonics
a lot of you actually just, you know, major support and resistance levels
of course, i'm not gonna give any publicity to courses that i have done, because i have done a bunch
i'm not going to say, i did this course, i did that course, so you can just go randomly and get that course
but what my course is just going to be super simple, focused and easy stuff
there are a lot of courses that don't explain risk management properly
make five ten minute videos to go straight to the point, guys
but anyway, i can show you a bunch of books here, um, you know which i do
alexander elder, it's more, it's more the psychology of trading
um, any books, any books of trading, is going to give you you know, knowledge and experience
there's no what cause that is gonna give you, you know, massive gains
it's you, your experience, your years, knowing what is correct, knowing what is wrong
and the more books you read, the more courses you do, i think, is the better
you know, the more times you spend on the chart, the better to to eliminate what works for you and to, you know, keep what is, um, is good for your trading
if you just google harmonic book, you know, harmonic patterns on amazon
you know, even the first book that comes out is going to be good
um, should i short storage? well, this is, you know, a question that you need to do for yourself
i think this one has had massive pumpy action, uh, the last few days
um, this one's hitting the the strongest point of control from the last, you know, four years of volume traded, pretty insanely
it's hitting the strongest point of control at this moment, which should be getting heavily rejected
this is very unprobable going to have a a break out to the upside
so we got confluence number one, you're hitting the biggest point of control from the volume trader the last four years
that is a huge sign already for a potential short at this level
let's zoom in on the chart and see what we can see with this price action
um, [Music], biggest point of control, even zooming in from from the last year, from may of last year till june
you know, it's still the strongest point of control, from one year, zooming in even further in
let's take a look at what, what kind of volume we do have here? um, we have higher, it's more or less, more or less, taking a look at the last six months
um, [Music], it's, it's, we are in a very good zone here for for a big rejection
now, question is, like most of you, where should i, you know, trace my fibonacci? is it from here, or is it from here? well, looking at the daily chart, of course, you know, i would trace it from this point
we can zoom in slightly on the four hourly and it's, it's a, for me, it's definitely from this zone
that's where, you know, you have a big pump here on the fourhour candlestick
if you are trading these cryptos, stay cautious, you know, with liquidations with high leverage, because they are very, very volatile
but, you know, take a look at fib level from this height to the low point right there
you could get a little bit of more volatility here, you know, going to that, you we actually hit the one dollar
i mean, one dollar also isn't a nice, round, you know, psychological resistance level
okay, support resistance, depending if you're above or below, it's a nice round level
so, yeah, i mean, this is, i mean, i'm just adding confluence here
value area low from the volume traded here the last six months, hitting that range
biggest point open control from the last six months traded is exactly at the one dollar eight
i'm not sure if you're gonna get that leg up, but you know, the reason why you have, um, the volume profile here is because of this volume traded in between january and april
and, you know, these lows over here is what we are getting respected right now
look how beautifully we did get respected here on this, you know, breakdown from this support level on storage right there
you know, if we do have one more leg up, because this has just happened, you know, between yesterday and today
i mean, this is, this is a very good level to potentially short
you've already created too many waves, right? one, two, three, four, five kind of thing
i mean, i'm a long time, i don't sure all coins if i'm shorting all coins, uh, i'm gonna definitely risk less than one percent of my portfolio, because i get stopped out a lot of times, because i do have good risk management, you know
and they're so volatile that i just get, you know, sometimes you just get stopped out with the last kind of legs up, right before you get that, um, that potential corrective move fight stop loss, i would wait
if the price action pumps, retest the highs and, you know, closes one hourly candle below the highs, starts consolidating, still consolidating, you know, in between today and tomorrow
uh, it would be a, you know, high probability short then, you know, the probabilities are goes even higher if you do come back up to retest that one dollar area, or slightly one dollar, still consolidate in between today and tomorrow, if we see this kind of price action, it would, it, it's very highly probable that this will finally correct
now, your question is, what levels would you take profit areas? no, right
if you do get that less last leg up and get start getting rejected, get in as high as possible
if you do get stopped out and you still consolidate, you can always reenter that trade
i got my mum that's in the isle of man, and she's with my grandad
um, so anyway, if storage does have that reaction in the next coming days at the one dollar level, tries and hit this, hit this level and still consolidate, it is gonna get, uh, rejected
if you get stopped out and you still consolidate and get rejected
longer you are here, for me, the longer it is it is getting rejected
you know, when i've been impatient a lot in the past, and it's not good
you just need a couple of trades guys a month to make huge, huge gains
but anyway, like i said, patiently, wait for a little bit more reaction
you know, if it comes down from this level, well, yeah, there'll be another opportunity tomorrow
but being patient, waiting for that failed breakout, swing, failure, double top, however you want to call it, is is key to jump on that trade
um, so yeah, i would wait, but i think there's a high chance that we're going to fall down here
now, your question might be, where can we get supported? where is a good take profit zone? well, already, you know, looking at fib levels, i would take it from this low or from this low
so, you know, the 618 level um, which is out there, 76 75 cents
you've also got the spikey on the vpvr, okay, from the volume trader the last, you know, uh, 10, 20 days approximately
you know, that would be a, definitely a take profit one where you could maybe get that bounce to attempt to hit the highs again, and then create a massive double top
of course, you you might have the possibility in losing this range, right? you might do this, get a small bounce and then continue back down
we need to remember that we are in an aggressive downtrend, so you could still be in that position, waiting for lower, take 50 profits
you know, wait a few days with the volatility, just in case you do have that big, bigger correction
and my take profit 2 would definitely be here at the 60 cent level, where we do have the value area high from this massive momentum that we've had, you know, in may and and part of june
and we do see also the the the price action here, right? we're getting very much respected
this is a must take profit zone if you're shorting from this level, and you, you know, if you don't get stopped out, of course, on a potential leg up, take profit zone right over here
i mean, i need to start trading some altcoins, because some of them are very much respected as support and resistance, such as storage here
and we had a beautiful breakout all the way to 78 cents and a beautiful bounce
i mean, the thing about all coins is that sometimes you don't get a reaction
but for this right you said, you can say, we didn't get a reaction here at the 60 cents, but if you come to the one hourly, or even the 15 minute, you know, did we actually stop? did we consolidate? slightly, ever so slightly, ever so slightly? um, but it was a pretty good trade
i mean, you could have risked along here, no doubt about that
you could have risked a long this was a a kind of a must trait
beautiful, beautiful resistance, a solid breakout, perfect bounce here, to come back up to retest the highs and even going higher
you could have taken profits at the 618, where, you where you did get a reaction
i mean, this is the thing, this is why i do say, you know, take 50 of profits at the 618
we went slightly higher, but got rejected from, the from this zone
and, you know, if you're in along here, you take 50 of profit
you have a free ride here, just in case you do get a huge, massive momentum
so this is why, if you are shorting storage at this one dollar range, you know, if we do get that leg up, even better and get a reaction, like i said, even better to confirm the exhaustion of the bears for that roll down, you can um ride a free trade
you know, like i said, 618, big resistance level spike on the via pvr
protect your position, because you might have that leg up and, you know, have a big spike, because they're all coins, they are insanely volatile
or you might be kind of lucky, right? or the highest probability is that you are going to create a lower high and continue to the downside
um, that would be the, like, i know the scenario, right? a lot of people say, oh, you're an artist, you know, you, you're actually trying to predict what the price is going to do
no, no, we actually taking a look at levels here where we could, we could bounce
thank you very much for your insane, uh, massive support, guys
um, i can see loads of spanners and, i don't know, hammers and all sorts here
dan says, um, i got my mom here from, from, uh, from the island man
i am going there actually next week, guys, when we're having the world series of trading competition
but i can't be on holiday because it's the world series of trading on bibit cannot be on holiday
let's take a look at gmt right away, and then we're going to take a dan cleary, thanks very much for the super chat
saying, can you check quant and hedera do you hold? and why? i do not hold any quant or any hedera hedera
why? because i can't hold everything, right? your question is, why? and, um, i don't like holding more than 10 12 all coins
uh, i don't want to have a a portfolio of, you know, 40 alt coins
you know, you have the high risk, low high risk ones with a low capital
i've divided them in 33, 33, 33 um as in, very high risk ones with low cap for those insane potential gains or losses
so i'm going to take a look at hedera, but first of all, let's take a look at gmt
mark dutch, davor, uh, joseph, right now, i'm not sure if sebzeb is here
yeah, they're the ones that, you know them, they're making me focus to take a look at, you know, super chats
and wherever we go, i will be ready, guys, with my sniper, ready to get into trade
um, pretty cool trades on gmt back here in april, and may haven't traded uh, gmt might be one of those all coins that i that i will trade on on the competition, uh, for buybit, because it's, it does respect very well the levels
four of them were, you know, successful trades, uh, because they're very much respected, you know, fib levels
it will be one of them that i will be analyzing to, adding on, adding to bitcoin
of course, i won't be uh, analyzing much, much all coins, but i think gmt could possibly be one
it's another way to support the channel, because obviously i do get a small commission for recommending this platform
it is kind of the one that is has one of the most liquidity, you know, very fast, um, trades per second
it's just one of the most famous, right? so anyway, if you've got an insane bonus, it's up to 450 worth of bonus
and it's another way to support the channel, if you use my link in the description
so anyway, talking about gmt right away, looking for those high probability trades is one of those that i'm going to use on, uh, for the private, for the private competition
tomorrow, the 25th, is when i'm going to open, first of all, for those people that have joined the team
i didn't even think that we were going to reach 10 people, honestly, um, i thought we were gonna reach, i don't know, yeah, he was about 10, 15, maybe 20
okay? also below by bit, you need at least 500 usdt to join the team
okay? only for the people that are joining the bible competition, not for everyone
i'll be opening the chat see, you know, getting the people that are not, getting the people out that are not joined the team, and having it active
just for the competition, starting to take a look at some levels, levels to take those trades for the competition that starts on the 27th of june, till the 17th of july
anyway, there is a prize pool of up to 8 million, okay? obviously, 8 million distributed for the best team, the best leader, the best trades
let me just get this fib level out of the way for one second, to just analyze the situation
gmt, zooming in here on the four hourly charts, taking a look at this range
now, you can see that we have broken this low, high resistance trend line right from these lower highs, very aggressive lower highs on gmt, right there
now, is this bullish? is this a successful breakout? absolutely not
but why if we have broken the resistance trend line? first of all, we are basically hitting the strongest, you know, level here of support that is turning into resistance right now
it is exactly, you know, in this 80 cent range, okay? plus minus one or two cents, because of the volatility
you have one touch there, two, you have three here above, okay, this one's at 87
but, you know, you do have two touches there, and you are getting this reaction
this is not, we are also not above the last lower high, which would be here
this is very, very likely and very possible, it will roll back down, at least to retest this low area, which is the 70 cent level
this is a strong, strong resistance zone that can be turned into support
and if it's broken, of course, you are going to retest these lows
we've got a beautiful bouncy from a daily level that i marked on
look at this beautiful daily level right over here from the 20th of march
this is why, you know, you know, this is why chart data from the past is extremely important, to take a look at major levels
if we take a look at fibonacci levels, you know, we've got this high over here, but i actually we are hitting the 382 to perfection also
this is telling me that the price could get heavily rejected in the next coming hours
um, what else? what else? what else? i actually prefer this fibonacci level
um, from the fibonacci from this level, right? this is this consolidation and the start of the drop from here down to the lows
we almost almost, i think we did touch, almost touch the six, one, eight here
if you take fib level from this high right to the low, because that is the drop
okay? um, almost hitting the 618, which is at the 86 cent level
we just hit 855 approximately on the high created on the 21st of june
i think this is gonna get heavily, heavily rejected from the zone
um, tight stop losses is the key, where is a major take profit zone
i think we, we're going to claim these lows and actually touch this resistance turning into support
you know, the risk to reward, the risk management here can be very, very good
you know, above this high, you know, you can always reenter a trade if you do get that swing failure and rejection
this is a danger of these old coins, you do get those wicks to kind of get those stops
um, now, this is why i am very patient a lot of the times where you can get that wick to the upside and come back down, and then you you enter when you have the confirmed swing failure pattern, right? because i'm kind of this, uh, so, yeah, a risk to reward
you know, give it, give it a, give it a little bit of room, let it breathe
you know, a few pips, a few, um cents in the case of gmt, right there
it's a little bit of a risky one, but, you the risk to reward is, you know, this low is very likely going to be gained
and even retesting this low, you know, the risk to reward is pretty high
um, you are kind of confirming this kind of double top, right there
it's a little bit of a risky trade, but i do see that potentially happening
i want to try and read the comment section, and it's always mission impossible
insane volatility on herdera here, another crypto that i do not like to take a look on the charts
what happened, you know, in since, uh, from august 2021, massive volatility here with this uptrend
but anyway, we're here to analyze what is happening now, what not, what happened before? um, hedera hashgraph
okay, look, there's, we got the highs created back here in 2020, strong high levels right there where we are getting this bounce
and it's also the value area high from this zone, right? we do have a massive bigger trading volume from, you know, late 2019 and the entire 2020
and the value area high is right over here, where we are exactly getting this bounce
the six cent level, you're getting that price action, you're getting the reaction, massive volatility
you know, double bottom right now, i think is very, very possible
kind of a dual bottom scenario for hedera is likely in the immediate short term
if we go to the four hourly, we need to remember that we are an aggressive downtrend
if we do get the price action coming back, coming back up to the 88 cent level, it might be a good shorting opportunity
biggest point of control from, the last, what, um, 40 days traded
and i think this would be the seven eight zone, seven eight fibonacci
from this drop, you know, could get that, could get very much respected and come back down
uh, i think you would also be, you know, retesting this lower high trend line
you could get a big, big, big rejection, just adding confluence
seven eight fibonacci, also big support, big spike on the vpvr
you know, if you do hit that level in the next couple of days, uh, it's very likely going to get some kind of rejection
but we're looking for shortterm trading opportunities here, right? let me just, um, just go through the super chat
um, got the poll here saying, will bitcoin price pump in the next coming days? i've got 53 of people saying yes
um, it's, it's, it's a draw here, almost, you know, it's almost 50 bullish, 50 bearish
there is a battle in between balls and bears at this moment in the comment section
it will always be up and down, and opportunities to take every day, always on the market
and i'm going away for a one week to the isle of man, because i'm checking, you know, i've got my mum's cousin getting married
um, i'm gonna see the family, and it's gonna be in the middle of the competition, so i'm gonna have to try and focus a lot, uh
for dennis, let's take a look at d5 chain for dennis, right away
i'm not sure if we're going to have more price data here on d5 chain
we've got more price data on bittrex, so we can take a look at the bittrex chart
i'm guessing that you want to know about this crypto, not for trading, potentially for accumulating
it's, you can buy it on spot on buy a bit, but not for trading
so i would think that you are interested in, you know, accumulation levels for d5 chain, and not trade, uh, trading it
looking at the daily we've just only started to consolidate a few days ago
but the first week of june, the second week of june, we were falling off a cliff
i would wait for, you know, sideways action to identify a potential bottom
we need at least several weeks to to know that there is a potential flaw, right? when you have just, when we've just stopped here the last couple of days, it's not enough, it is not enough
unless we do have a large, large consultation, i actually think a relief rally could happen, small relief rally, um on on d5 chain
but like i said, we need several weeks for a potential, you know, detection of a bottom, right? you know, this has bottom out because we've been here trading for a couple of months, we've, uh, we still, you know, we're still aggressively in a downtrend
we went up very, very fast from, you know, the 20 cent, 20 30 cent level, you know, this is where we picked up
and i say most of the people, you know, when you go up that fast and the price action goes through these levels, you the price action is gonna make, you're gonna make the same kind of price action, and even faster
once we lost this low level of the summer of 2021, uh, this low support range, once we did lose it, price action went the same as fast
we can even come much, much lower, to 50 cents, 30 cents, and maybe find a base at those levels
we've got balls and bears double top forming on the four hourly
i mean, i tried to take a look at most of the comment section
what i do think you know the deal on what levels, what kind of movement? i am looking for, guys
make sure to join you know, primex bt for that insane bonus of up to seven at 70, not up to seven percent
you get seven percent of any deposit up to one hundred thousand dollars of deposit
okay? to get that seven thousand dollars worth of owners if you, you know, deposit ten thousand, you're getting seven hundred dollars to trade with
i've got full video tutorials on buy bit and primex bt down below
i have, uh, check out the bitcoin sensors website guys for the latest news and technical analysis ideas
the latest article here is bitcoin whales are buying the dip, despite the decline scene for btc
are you buying bitcoin at these levels? that will be the next question for the for the live stream
i want to know, are you buying bitcoin at these levels? thank you guys for joining
in today's episode, i will show you why i could potentially see a buy opportunity on bitcoin if you potentially pull back down and retest 20 610 around this level
and i also have three targets on the same fibonacci take probably one
but if we would see bigger momentum to the downside and we break below 20 364, the market could potentially create a lower low, pull back up to create a lower high
but please continue looking at this video together with me, and i'll show you why i potentially can buy the market on bitcoin, or potentially sell the market on bitcoin
and what i want to do is that i want to highlight the close of last weekly low of the candlestick, and we're just going to change it to round number
and you can see that this week, from the 20th, we've just been going sideways from this candlestick
so what we can see is that we're using this as a support right here
and what happened was that we saw that bitcoin gave us a fake out
we pulled back up, created and came back inside the previous support that would they break down from, trying to break it again, but with dave close above
and right now today we've seen the market going down a little bit
and if we would see that the market is breaking below 20 315, that could possibly be the market bouncing back down
but we can also see the market pulling back down to this level and also retest the low of last week's close at twenty thousand five hundred and twenty
we just might see the market pull back down and, uh, create it as another support
and we just might potentially see the market pull back to higher targets
because if we're looking at the overall, we've seen that the market did create, we are creating a support right now
so we just might see the market pull back up a little bit higher, because we just might need to have a pullback
but to go down to the lower time frames, it is, it is easier for us to see what's actually happening
but right now, the market, it is friday, the market is very slow overall
so what we also can see right here on the chart is that we do have this inverted head and shoulders
and that is a bullish reversal pattern that can take us back up to higher targets
if we would see that the market is taking us to higher targets, we can come up and retest 23 040
so if we go down to the lower time frames to see if we potentially see the market have bullish momentum to the upside
so um, we did have a support, resistance trend line right here that we did break
we can go down to the four hourly, just to connect the dots a little bit more, looking something like this, i would say
so what i do is that i connected with this first push back down, that we also had to retest that 23 040
this is technically also a lower high, because it it is below 22 583
what happens that we also saw the market, as i spoke about low, high low
and we just might potentially pull back down and create another high low against the last week close
or we're just going to stay above this resistance trend line and see a potential continuation to the upside um
this doesn't mean that the whole trend will reverse, but we just might need to have a bigger pullback right now, another thing that we can do, based on this trend line that we did break, we can connect it with these higher lows too
and what i'm going to do is that i will drag a fibonacci from twenty thousand two hundred and fifty seven back up to twenty one thousand one hundred and ninety five
and we just might see the market pull back down now to twenty thousand seven hundred and twenty seven, potentially pull back down to twenty thousand hundred 620
and if we would see the market respecting these levels, we can obviously also come back down to the support that i spoke about before
everything depends on how volatility the market will be to the downside
but technically, the last higher low is this one that we do have around twenty thousand two hundred and forty eight
so the market has some space to actually come back down and retest this level
looking at the four hourly chart, why i use this uh, because on the on the lower time frames, on the one hourly, we could say that this is a high low
but it's always better to use the four hourly for hourly, uh time frame, because those this, this is the most respected one
because if we're only looking at the one hourly, which is my as, it looks like we can actually have bigger momentum to the downside now, because we do have a pretty volatile candlestick
so we just might need to pull back down to twenty thousand five hundred and twenty
and we just might see that the other fibonacci levels will be a little bit differently
so twenty thousand five hundred and sixty four, potentially twenty thousand four hundred and sixteen two
that means that we will break inside the the resistance trend line
but we have to have in mind that we just might need to come back down and retest the fibonacci level and then see the market push back to the upside
if this fibonacci level will be valid, take profit one on this fibonacci will be 21 436
take profit 2 will be 22 075, and take profit 3 will be 22 640
i do not know how far the market will pull back up, but the the fibonacci levels that i have based uh, with this fibonacci, but the targets is usually very good
but if we would see the market now from a bearish perspective, if we would see a drop, it is the weekend now, so the market is very slow
but if we do have a bigger momentum, and we break below 20 376, and we just might also see the market break the previous higher low at 19956
if the market creates a lower low, i wait for the market then to potentially pull back up and retest the support
and also the the last, the the last weekly close of the body, we just might see the market retested from below
and that with that, we will also be below this resistance trend line
so everything, in that case, what happens around here will only be a fake out
we'll see the market drop in below again, pull back up, retest the same resistance trend that would try to break
obviously, in 1904, the key level, is definitely something that i look at
if we have a bigger momentum, 17 040 can also be at the target we could potentially see the market pull back down to
so everything right now is just a waiting game for me, um, because it is the weekend
and if we see a bigger pullback, i i, as i told you, i look at 23 040, but the fibonacci levels is also something that i would look at
and so yeah, we just might see the market pull back down now for a retest, and then see the slowly and steady continuation to the upside
or if we break below the the previous uh support at 20 520, create a lower low, pull back, create a lower high
i was seeing some position on bitcoin, but my stoploss got taken
it's up to now four thousand four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
but the good thing about buy bid is that, when we hold our positions for a longer time as swing traders, we will have the very low fees
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
hit the notification so you know when i am live or when i do have my daily updates
remember that every every morning, eight am, swedish time, one hour before london session opens, i do have live morning livestream from monday to friday
so we go through the charts together before the whole day starts
i love this morning live stream, so don't forget to until next week to be part of that
just one second before we go into the charts, let me just send me the links to my beautiful community
but that is, uh, what i mean, what can i do? what can i do? let's see who's here
albert uh anna, thomas, vishesh, michael mohammed babu, awaken soul
my name is sleeping golden, and i know a person that likes you
how are you? mr president? is here? i hope everyone is feeling great
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please come inside and do that, so you can help me grow the channel
so we want to, of course, help other people also to find this youtube channel so we can, you know, share our knowledge where i can share my knowledge with you guys, because i know that, i know that people needs it
what are you talking about? why you wake so early? yeah, lauren, she wants to sleep at these times, guys
uh, dolak carlos, because i love that, and it's the only reason you're so sweet
um, a friend of mine asked me yesterday, why do we celebrate, uh, midsummer? and i told her, i actually do not know
or i i usually say, when people ask me, why do you play? why do you celebrate midsummer? and i'm like, well, it's just an excuse for grown, for people to to drink alcohol and go loco
um, but i think it's because it's the middle of the summer, we celebrate that, but i don't celebrate it
uh, what do we have news coming out today? we have something around, uh, 1 30 pm today
um, but i don't think that's gonna be, i don't think the market will
uh, we had some take profits, uh, yesterday that got hit, which is beautiful
even though i'm no financial advisor, because that's not what i am
well, president is usually not that fun, so i'm not surprised, you know
we okay, so we did have this week yesterday, the last 12 hourly candlestick, we did have this wick, uh, that came back down and retested the resistance trend line
and i also, i was also looking at this candlestick yesterday, because when we have one huge wick down to the downside like this, the market is always going down
um, if you go to the four hourly charts, and my computer is slow, as you guys can see, i do apologize by that
so what we're gonna do now now we're gonna change the resistance trend line, because the lower we need to connect everything with the lower highs
and you could also see, if we did that yesterday, how perfectly the market also came back up and retested the support at the resistance trend line, very, very perfectly
uh, we are still above the the support, uh, at 104 point, 140
i've been using the support as a guideline to see if we would break it or not
so we had fake outs retest market push back up, right? i do expect the market to reverse to the upside, but which is not that just might happen today, um, because, yeah, we're still creating
so we do expect the market to to break to the upside from this level
and why do i do that? well, because, overall, the market is in a uptrend on, uh, dollars
but the market now has been, uh, creating, potentially now a higher low
um, so, uh, yeah, i, i do expect, but on the lower let's see how it looks in the lower time frames
yeah, you as you can see, retest of the the fibonacci connected with the support, support, potential, high, low
now, so we also have a trend line here that we're trying to break
hello dobies, how are you? and we're trying to break, right now, on the 15 minutes chart, we're trying to break the, uh, 104237
if we break this level, and you see the market reads us from above, that is definitely the market, uh, to pull back to the upside
first of all, guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that
help me grow the channel, guys, and i will help you with the coins
i will still believe the mark, uh, market will continue back down
are you ready to wait two years for bitcoin back to his real price? good morning lilly
i told everyone, even though i'm no financial advisor, i told everyone to you are
how do you mean, filippo, in what way? um, yeah, just, i'm just confirmed
i'm just trying, because i still believe the market will continue back down
i'm just trying to give you now more confirmations of what i see
so what i also did was that i highlighted the support that we did have since before a little resistance
uh, go down to the obviously she's a woman, if we're the opposite
i i also use the support trendline one more time on the higher time frames
i told everyone, even though i'm not financial advisor, but i told everyone to move, stop loss to entry
um, so, yeah, no, it was a great session that we did have on on the live stream, um, yesterday
and, um, i am, as i told you, i'm already in self position on both, is there ethereum and on bitcoin
i never changed my, i didn't change my, uh, anything, even though i saw the market pull back up, you know, patient is key, right? i'm just gonna hold my positions because i still see the market, um, going down
we are inside the sixty one point eight percent on a daily fibonacci between twenty one thousand one hundred and seventy three and twenty thousand seven hundred and fifty two
we just might see the market break below the previous higher low, uh, or the previous high at twenty thousand five hundred and sixty five
this is what i see right now on bitcoin, waiting for the market to drop, going to ethereum, salty
so we are above key level, 1130, 30, i also drag the fibonacci from, uh, 1237 back down to 992 dollars
we're also retesting the fibonacci, as i said, at six to one point and a one, uh, six to six to, uh, sixty one point eight percent
uh, at one thousand one hundred and forty four, you go down to the lower time frames
this is market always look like this before the market is dropping
this market does always look like this before it's dropping, and especially when we are inside the fibonacci level
so i, um, this doesn't have to happen, obviously, because it's only probabilities
can you see, also, on the one hourly chart, you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, like you have so many weeks just screaming, we're not continuing to that upside
by just looking at the the technicals, this looks like we can definitely pull back down
but also, for another confirmation, i'm already in a cell position on ethereum, so i'm not gonna go into another cell position, obviously
i mean, my strategy is, most of the time that i wanted to break the support, uh, create the lower low, come back up to create the lower high, and then see the drop
i do actually have a pretty good position right right now already
and another thing that we can see on the lower time frames is that if we break below 1130, we can definitely see rita's from it, and then see the market continues back down
so yeah, this is, uh, i i strongly believe that we will see the market, um, reverse same thing that we did yesterday
um, so if we see a pullback now in the lower this and we're looking at the 15 minutes chart, we just might see the market pull back up and retest either 1145, 1147 for a pullback, and then see the drop
so this is actually, uh, to sell them, a sell limit order that i will put, uh, that i will also put and my stoploss
this is, i don't, this is will not happen today, obviously, that we will see the market pull back down
it is crazy good if this baby is gonna go down from here, um, because i take this the entry on the lower time frames, yeah, retest around 1145 or potentially 1140
yeah, this actually, okay, i need to, i need, i need to add some, i need to add my positions
i just need to add some positions here on ethereum, just one second on momentos
okay, so i'll give you, oh, because i'm no financial advisor, guys, always, always, always remember that i'm no financial advisor
so i have my tp at 930, but that is a long trade, so that is swing trading for me
um, if i would take my if i would take some other take profits, because the fibonacci that i have right now, that is only based on the entry
so this is what i see right now on on ethereum, so as i told you, i am no financial advisor at all
but you do whatever you want to do, but this is i take, i take these trades myself, right? so if stop loss, get hit, it's also get hit for me
i, as i told you, i'm already in some positions on bitcoin since before
i have been very patient when it came to this one, right? um, guys, if you want to be part of my community, you have the link in the description down below the video
so on this community, you obviously have more contact with me and the rest of my beautiful community, and you are more than welcome
and on this, uh, community, we speak about trading, and, you know, just connect with with each and every one
so, yeah, this is, uh, you're more than welcome to be part of that
you can also receive the bonus right now, which changed, it changed the bonus up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars right now
so up to, depending obviously, what you are depositing to that
but, um, by bit is great when it comes to, especially swing trading
for me, example, i do have at 930 if the market now comes to that level
you sure you're not had early to i don't even know that what that means
us 30 went crazy yesterday, even more to the upside, but we are still inside
so previous higher low usually becomes next lower high on the lower time frames
should i like, excuse me, i'm sitting in a live stream right now
can you be quiet? the mother's gonna be like, who are you? but who are you tell your kid to be quiet because i have a beautiful community and you are disturbing us right now
now, what i'm gonna do, because we are coming, we're coming up to, and we are retest a pregnant, we're retesting a previous higher low
if we go back in time on the weekly chart, which is really important, go down to the lower time frames
i went in and i saw this supply zone that we do have between thousand eight hundred and seventeen and thirty thousand nine hundred and forty four
we can right now see the market is starting to reject this level
i do expect the market to drop, but need to have some more confirmations before, uh, before i do anything, obviously, uh, because you can definitely see the market, um, we just might see the market continue, uh, to the upside, right? so that is why we need the confirmation
and other thing, uh, we can use this little trend line on the lower time frames
okay, so if b if you study, breaks below 30 763, and we see the market then pull back up for a retest that for me, is designed to go into the charts, actually
so what if the market breaks below that level? that's when i will go in and look to see where, if i'm going to sell us 30 or not
we're also using this high as you can see, that we're retesting
oh, i actually started to eat fish again a couple of weeks ago when i, i decided that i wanted to start eat meat again
natalie, were you previously? i've never treat, okay, i never traded forex, to be honest
i was actually talking to, i was actually talking to one of my best friends, and he's also a traitor
because both me and him where where we like to trade the players, that's very volatile because, you know, that's just the type of, you know, everything depends on what the type of personality
but me and him started to trade together at 2018, and we, you know, we, we were going through this journey together
so he's like my, the tightest friend that i have when it comes to um, when it comes to um, when it comes to trading
but we spoke about forex pairs, and he said, i tried to go in and trade forex, but it's just, so, it's so boring
you know, when you're used to trading, you is 30, you're used to trading bitcoin
these are the, these are the like, most volatile pairs that i know about
so when you're looking at forex pairs, it takes you like 20 years before the market even comes to your entry, or even comes to your take profit
well, why, uh, what enter do you get for eat ethereum? this is what i have on ethereum right now
so you, you better screenshot it because i can't go back and forth on it
in some way, they're just, i don't know, they're just volatile
um, i would say that index pairs are more reliable when it comes to market structure
but i would say that i like to trade bitcoin more than i like to trade use 30
and just, i want to see if my stop loss or take profit gets hit
i don't know, that's just what i'm used to, but everyone's different
if we break below 11 710, that, for me, is a clear indication to jump into the chart for a potential sale opportunity
but i want the market to break that level, create the lower low, and then give me the lower high, and then i will go into the charts, potentially, and sell the market
because if that is the case, previous resistance, potential fake out
but we're also inside the fibonacci levels between one thousand eleven thousand eight hundred and fifty five and eleven thousand seven hundred and eleven
is there anything else that you want me to look at guys before i go? is there anything? oh, yeah, tomashi, you asked me why i eat fish again
darling, okay, we're just gonna do a different analysis we had yesterday
so either we will see the market, uh, if we start to see more momentum to the upside, we just might see the market do this, right? create high highs and high lows at the higher time frames
we have fibonacci levels at zero points 720 and zero point eight hundred, if the market will be bullish
this will not happen today, but definitely something in the near future
and if we come pull back up to these levels, this could be where we potentially see another lower high being created
now, what i did was that, okay, so we are at a preview support that we're that we try to break above
and we're also, we also have a, where did i take it? what's it for? i will chart on the daily, was it two daily chart? maybe on the two daily charts
we also have a supply zone, and that is between, uh, zero point six hundred and twenty dollars and six hundred and fifty one dollars
so previous, uh, supply zone usually get retest very fast, and then you see the drop
we're also using the at the help of this resistance trend line, um, that we are slightly below at the moment
and uh, if we would see the market, uh, break below potentially 583 dollars and break the support trendline, uh, the setup is not so good right now on magic, i would say, because, you know, you just see the market pull back up
we don't have any, we don't have such great market structure, uh, if we're not looking at the lower time frames
we do have it, um, but i wouldn't do anything if i start to see bigger momentum
as i said, break 583 and then c reads us from below, as long as we're holding ourselves below the support and creates it as a new resistance
i don't have any and okay, so if that, if i would sell the market, if the market gave me that, ta, around 584
um, go back to the live stream if you missed what i said, so you can just repeat it yourself
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that
hit the notification so you know when i am live or when i do have my daily updates
and don't forget that you can also receive the best bonus right now available on by bit through bitcoin census and me you have the link in the description down below the video
um, you have it's up to four thousand and four hundred and fifty dollars right now
um, we so the market did a very, very, very beautiful in here
okay, so we did break below the support trendline that we did have a couple of days ago
i used to remember when i used the previous, uh, the previous resistance at one point seven thousand two hundred and seventy around this is a level, the previous resistance
what happened? market came back up, right now, retested it as a new resistance
so what we're looking at here is only fake out from this resistance, right? what happens? market pulls back up, retest the right, uh, resistance, and then we just might now see the, see the drop, right? another thing that we can do is that we're using the support trendline on the four hourly charts, go down to the lower time frames
and we can also use this previous low, and that is also a previous resistance and a support that we're breaking below at the moment
we connected with this with the push high low, broke, retested it as a new resistance
so technically the best, uh, we had a great sell opportunity right here, because we did break the support trend line, retested acid resistance
um, i don't have, i don't have a setup right now, uh, when it comes to, um, fibonacci
but if we see the market pull back down and then potentially see a retest from below at this previous resistance, also support around one thousand seven thousand, one point seven thousand, that could uh be the drop from here
but i'm already in the okay, so we're about to break below my resistance, right? uh, my entry
okay, we have the drop, let's see if we can find something else
hello, roland, how are you guys? if you want to be part of, uh, bitcoin census, natalie
um, but i will also pin the i will change to buy bit bonus instead now
and don't forget that you can receive the best bonus right now on buy bits up to thousand four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link painting the chat
uh, any possibility of adding sub sometimes you stream a few days i'm acting
but if we don't see, because i still have my sell limit orders at, uh, 4, four one thousand one hundred and forty six
i need to see the market giving me a lower high before i see, before i even go into a trade again
but i'm already inside a trade on bitcoin and on ethereum, and it is around these levels where we are right now
so we are slightly above my entry that i took a couple of days ago, um, but can definitely find another one
so if anyone's new to, uh, this is, this is the celimate order i do have on ethereum right now
but i'm no financial advisor, because it can definitely hit stop loss
so on bitcoin, um, if we break below 20 576, uh, create the lower law
and then i'm waiting for the market, obviously, to create the lower high, and that's where i will sell the market
we're still above the support trend line, which is representing the pullback, but we are inside, uh, we are inside 21 142, and right now at 20 745
when it comes to the fees, prime expertise can have a pretty high, i don't like prime expertise when it comes to holding your positions, obviously, for a long time
um, but prime expt is really good when it comes to, you know, scalping day trading overall
always be very careful, because, you know, a lot of people get so, you know, pumped when when we speak about leverage
um, so we don't want to, we don't want to lose money, right? we need to be careful with what we do
on the four hour chart, we're closing this candlestick in one out in one hour
is it an evening star, an evening star and an evening star? inside the fibonacci levels, inside the uh, we're slightly below, we are below key level 21, 040
we we came below, retested the the previous resistance, created now potentially the the bearish reversal pattern
so this, for me, is definitely a sign that we can pull back down
john, do you know nat who's john? we obviously don't know each other
but you can also see that we have, we have the 21 point for the key level
we are inside fibonacci levels, which means that we can reverse back down
i the stop loss can definitely get hit, but that's what i see
if my stoploss get hit, i will just take the next trade and move on with my life, you know? okay, looking at dodge coin
we came inside exactly fibonacci, 6515 go down to the lower time frames now
i don't have a setup right now, because we just might see the drop from here, uh? and the market is not giving me any opportunity to put a fibonacci because, okay, so we are inside the fibonacci level right now though
everything depends on if you want to hold your position, my position, for a longer time
but based on this fibonacci, we can come back down to 5997, seventy, 5674 and five thousand three hundred and ninety three on the lower time frames
everything depends on from where the mark, if the market pulls back up and create another lower high, and then see the drop
but if we would ins you know, see a potential pull back up to 6500
if you don't see the drop right now, take profit one from, uh, five, 6517
take profit two, six thousand three hundred and forty and take profit three, six thousand seven, six thousand two hundred and seventy one
but i don't it's not a great setup right now, because the market has already done the retest and gave us the, uh, the entry retest

my name is josh, and ethereum has just broken above key resistance, while over two billion dollars worth of bitcoin has just been withdrawn from exchanges
so i'll be talking about all of that and more in this video, so definitely stick around
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and as you can clearly see on this chart, we're actually seeing the nasdaq 100 index ends this week very strong, which, of course, helps crypto prices in the shorter term, if we're seeing bullish price action in the short term for the stock market
but keep in mind, when you're talking about the larger trend here, obviously we're still well and truly in this larger bearish trend
so for now, this is just a shorter term bounce in the stock markets
and technically speaking, in order to see a bullish trend in the price action here on the daily chart
we need to see higher highs and higher lows, but obviously that has not happened as of right now
and keep in mind, in around two and a half weeks from now, we have new inflation data coming in, which will show us what inflation was during june
and when we get that inflation data in around two and a half weeks, that would be very important, because it would likely tell us what the fed would do in the next fed meeting
and obviously, i'll be sure to keep you updated on this channel in these videos every single day
and obviously, we're still playing out that bullish divergence and bullish cross in the macd
and obviously this choppy, sideways price action that we've seen over the past five to six days is pretty much exactly what i've been saying we're most likely to see due to this bullish divergence and also that bullish cross in the macd, based on what we saw around a month ago
and if you're new to the channel, and you want more information about this chart right here, check out some of my recent videos here on the channel, where i went into a little bit more detail about this 12hour bitcoin charts
but if you're taking a look at the fourhour bitcoin charts, like i said yesterday, we do have this inverse head and shoulders pattern that is technically forming
and over the past few hours, we've actually seen a slight attempt of a breakout, but nothing really significant
and honestly, at the time of recording this video, we really have no confirmation, no proper confirmation, of a breakout for bitcoin above this neckline
and by the way, this neckline is coming into play at around 211k to 212 k
and in order to confirm a breakout above this neckline, out of this inverse header shoulders pattern, we need to at least see a four hour candle close
but if we could see a couple four hour candle closes above that neckline, that would be even better
and right now, at least on the binance exchange just here, we're not really seeing any significant spike in volume suggesting a breakout to the upside
so this just means we haven't really seen a confirmed breakouts for the bitcoin for our chart, above this neckline, at least at the time of recording this video
and aside from that, if you want more confirmations for a breakout to the upside, i'd also be looking towards this previous high, which is coming into play at around 217 k
because obviously, if we form a higher high, that technically sets us up for a shortterm bullish trend
but of course, the larger trend on the daily or the weekly chart, for example, is still a downtrend
just keep in mind that this is only talking about the shorter term trend
but once again, right now, at the time of recording in this video, we haven't confirmed a break above this previous high, at least just yet
and another confirmation method we can use from time to time is a possible retest
basically, after we see a breakout, if the price comes back down towards the neckline and confirms it as new support, that gives us extra confirmation for a breakout to the upside
so in some cases we might see a breakout, and we might see a slight correction along the way, but not necessarily retest the neckline all the time
so that's just something else to consider moving forward as well
and in case you missed my last video on the channel, the technical price target for this inverse seven shortness pattern, if we confirm a breakout above this neckline, like i've been saying, then that'll put the price target at around 26 000 per bitcoin
which, from the point of the breakout at this neckline to that price target, is around a 23 to 24 gain in the bitcoin price
so obviously, we could end up making some good profits from that move, if that does end up playing out, and if we do see that confirmation that we need, which we haven't seen at the moment
and now, an important onchain metric for bitcoin that i haven't covered for a while now is the amount of bitcoin that is sitting on exchanges
and if you're looking at the last one month worth of action here in this onchain metric, we can clearly see that a lot of bitcoin has left exchanges over the past one month
and if you're looking at the amount of bitcoin that has left exchanges over the past one month, that has been around a hundred thousand bitcoin leave exchanges in just one single month, which is, of course, equivalent to over two billion us
a hundred thousand bitcoin leaving exchanges in just one month is a big deal, especially considering the limited supply of bitcoin on exchanges already
and in fact, right now, as i'm recording this video, there's around 24 million bitcoin sitting on exchanges altogether
and that just shows how significant the bitcoin outflows from exchanges have been, especially over the past one month
because obviously, if we've seen a hundred thousand bitcoin leave exchanges in just one month, and there's only 24 million bitcoin on exchanges, then in around two years from now, at this current rate, exchanges will completely run out of bitcoin altogether
and remember, in less than two years, we have the next bitcoin halving in early 2024, where the amount of bitcoin being mined gets cut in half, while we're seeing billions of dollars worth of bitcoin leave exchanges and go into cold storage
so essentially, the liquid supply of bitcoin, the available supply of bitcoin, is becoming scarcer and scarcer, despite the price going down
now what is very interesting is, if you're taking a look at this exact same metric over the exact same time period
but for ethereum, we're actually seeing pretty much the exact opposite
so this chart right here shows the amount of ethereum sitting on exchanges each day over the past one month
and in fact, over the past one month, we've seen around 677 000 ethereum move on to exchanges in just one month, which is equivalent to around 800 million us
and you might be wondering, how could this be? if a lot of bitcoin is leaving exchanges, how is a lot of ethereum moving on to exchanges? it doesn't make much sense
and the answer to that could be two possible answers, or a mix of those two
first of all, it's possible we could see more ethereum getting deposited onto exchanges because people holding ethereum might be more bearish on ethereum compared to bitcoin
because when you send crypto out of a cold wallet onto an exchange, you're most likely going to sell that crypto
but another very likely answer as to why we're seeing a lot of ethereum enter onto exchanges is because over the past one month, pretty much ever since the lunar collapse
but especially in recent weeks, we've actually seen quite a significant collapse in the d5 space due to a lot of massive loans in d5 getting liquidated because of lower prices
and i won't go too much into detail about d5 in this video, because that is a whole nother video to make
but long story short, we're seeing a lot of debt, a lot of leverage, getting squeezed out of the market when we're seeing downside price action
because the more downtime price action we see, the more loans in d fight gets liquidated
and when those d5 loans get liquidated, the collateral, in most cases, gets sold onto the markets
and obviously, ethereum, being the leading smart contract platform, is a big part of d fire
so if there's a lot of loans getting liquidated in d5 with ethereum as the collateral, then, due to those loans getting liquidated, we're now potentially seeing a lot of that aetherium that was collateral in those loans moving onto exchanges to be sold
so the answer as to why we're seeing a lot of ethereum enter onto exchanges, especially over the past one month, is most likely one of those two possible answers, or more likely, a mix of those two
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum to your dollar chart on the weekly time frame
and as you can see right here, we're still playing out about from that 382 fibonacci level, which is coming in at around 1050
and at the time of recording this video, we've got a little over two days until we see the next weekly candle close
and at this stage, we're looking like it's possible we could see a green week after 11 consecutive weeks of red
and to my knowledge, that is the most amount of red weeks consecutively that we have seen for ethereum
so that really says just how crazy this time in the market is
and of course, we're still sitting in oversold territories in the weekly ethereum rsi, which has only happened just one other time in ethereum's entire price history, which was at the end of the 2018 bear market
and if you're zooming into the 12hour ethereum to yours dollar chance, we're still seeing this bullish divergence play out quite nicely over the past five to six days or so
and this also aligns with that bullish cost that we saw around five days ago in the 12hour ethereum macd
and of course, this is all very similar to what we saw roughly around one month ago
and if you zoom into the fourhour chart for ethereum, as you can see here, we have already seen a breakout to the upside above this neckline for the price of ethereum in terms of this inverse head and shoulders pattern
this neckline, by the way, is coming into play at around 1 150
and once again, this uses all the same confirmation methods as what i said for bitcoin earlier in the video
and you can see right here on the charts that we have already seen three four hour candle closes at the time of recording this video, above the neckline
so that means we already have some confirmation for this breakout to the upside
we don't have a lot of confirmation, but it is some confirmation
and what we've also seen is a break above this previous high that we set around three to four days ago, coming in at around 12 k
and technically speaking, according to this inverse header, shortest pattern, the technical price target is sitting at around one and a half thousand dollars per ethereum, which, from the point of the breakout to that price target, is around a 33 gain for ethereum
and at the current price at the time of recording this video, to that price target, that is still another 26 gain if it does play out
but it is important to mention that even though that is the technical price target for this inverse header shoulders pattern, we're still exposed to other levels of resistance along the way
for example, these highs that we set in place around one and a half weeks ago, those are coming into play at around 1250, approximately
and looking towards the tops of the wicks, they're coming in at around 1280
so in that small price range just there, we could be due for a bit of shortterm resistance
and i covered my shortterm trading strategy around these inverse headed shortest patterns in yesterday's video
so if you missed that video, definitely check it out if you want to know my trading strategy around these patterns
but adding to that, what i forgot to mention in yesterday's video is the fact that i don't enter an exit trade all in one go
so for an example of my trading strategy, let's just say i enter a trade when we see a breakout above resistance, but only with a much smaller amount, because at that stage we don't have a lot of confirmation, for example, just a four hour candle close
and then if we end up seeing more confirmation, such as a spike in volume or a possible retest of this previous line of resistance, and if we potentially flip it into new support, then in that case, in those situations, personally, i would slowly add to that position as we potentially see more confirmations
and on the flip side, when it comes to exits a position like this, personally, i did not wait for an exact price to exit the entire trade, because that is, of course, very risky
that's like waiting for the exact bottom to go all in, or the exact bull market top to sell everything
so instead, i simply break it up into different levels, and i look at levels of resistance where we could possibly turn around
in this example, i would potentially take a small amount of profits off the table in that trade
at that level of resistance, or any other potential level of resistance
and basically, as we get closer and closer towards the price target, i aim to average out of the trade the closer we get to the price target
i'm simply telling you what i personally do with my own money
and second of all, the other part of my shortterm trading strategy, when it comes to breakout trades like this, is in my yesterday's video, so in my last video on the channel
so what i said in this video is not my entire strategy altogether
and also, i want to make it clear that this is just a shorter term trading strategy when it comes to these shorter term movements
and my longer term investing strategy is something separate from my trading strategy
and going back to that level of resistance coming into play at around 1250 to 1280, it's actually very important for ethereum to break above that level
because if we don't, then, technically speaking, here on the 4hour chart ethereum does run the risk of potentially forming a rising wedge pattern, which is a bearish pattern
so that would contradict the inverse head and shoulders pattern
but once again, that would require a rejection from this level of resistance that i just mentioned earlier
and if you found this video useful, you should definitely check out this video popping up right here on your screen
because this video right here shows you how you can keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so, um, i know that a lot of people are actually experiencing quite a bit of fomo and stuff with the current push up in especially altcoins
you can see some of these altcoins have done eleven, twelve percent, fifteen percent
this is a your typical bear market rally, right, that you're experiencing over here
but first and foremost, and most notably, what you can see over here is with the bollinger bands on the four hour chart
you can see that the bollinger bands are starting to contract
now what happens when these bollinger bands contract is it's usually an indication that volatility is soon going to come to enter the market
when they start pinching and squeezing together, as they are over here, you're expecting the next couple of days, there will be some sort of a reactionary move over there
this white line over here, it's coming in at twenty two thousand six hundred dollars
that did mark our previous most important level to clear to create the next higher high, and then obviously continue on with the trend
okay, so this, this is coming in at twenty one thousand four hundred dollars over here
and if you manage to above that, then great, you've made your next higher high
and essentially, this is what i'm having a look at over here, is if i bring out this chart, which will show you some hidden bearish divergence, which is forming
if you have a look over here, you got one touch to touch, and i'll be looking for the third touch
if this, if price manages to clear that previous level that i showed over here, that would invalidate the hidden bearish diversions
and that would mean that essentially we can start to look for lungs again, probably then the dip is over
however, until then, the risk does still remain to the downside
so i have a vertical line that's marked out over here on the 28th of june
and this is when i would anticipate a lot of these things to start to play out
so i know a little bit of superstition, but it really does seem to work
you can have a look at the history of this, every single time
so bear moon comes in at the end of the month over there, and i would expect a little bit of chaos
now, i've also marked off over here the ethereum against bitcoin
so you have your bart simpson pattern, right? if you have a look at that over there, you have a bite simpson pattern which is forming
it's still showing a possible negative 25 down for bitcoin, which means altcoins will, of course, get absolutely smashed
you've lost the liquidity zone over here, uh, which is now flipping from previous support into resistance
what i would anticipate is, on this last spike that we're having on altcoins, dominance is falling a little bit, altcoins are pushing up
i'd except expect some sort of a rejection, either from the 42 percent, 428 percent area or the current, uh, midrange
or we had 441 a push up towards the range, high at 48 and possibly even above that
ah, whilst that happens simultaneously, you can expect that you would have some sort of rejection out of that box and a push down into the final liquidity zone
for the longer term investors, i just wanted to very quickly bring this out
you got the 255 ma, the main liquidity zone, which price has managed to hold above
however, any sort of breakdowns below that area, i would be accumulating as a dollar cost average investor
anytime you came underneath this logarithmic growth curve has been a great time to be a dollar cost averager
and what you can do is, you can literally just type into google dollar cost averaging calculator, have a look at what the results are over time
even if you were investing at the exact, uh, pinnacle, top of the move, so 69k, see what your return is
bear in mind, i'm someone that looks at the charts every single day, at least maybe eight to 12 hours a day, including weekends
but for most of you out there that are retail investors, you're working a fulltime job
this is a great time to dollar cost average, if you have a plan and you stick to it
that will also help you to deal with the fomo of when you get these big moves and you're not in the market
uh, you've also got the link for bibet, if you do want to support me and follow along with any of the trades, as well as the newsletter sign up, which is, we have elaborated on what i spoke about today
don't know what happened over here today, but, uh, nevertheless, that's all fair in love and war
for now, this crypto shorts video is proudly brought to you by unix gaming, the leading web 3 gaming ecosystem
not only a worldwide gaming community, unix is a launch pad, a gaming studio and a tekken content creator that serves the bridge between wave 2 and web 3
what is up, my crypto legends? how is everyone doing? hope you're doing absolutely fantastic today
but before absolutely destroy that like button, guys, we're going to take a look at some levels here for bitcoin, highest probability zones
what is going to happen? are we going to drop? are we going to go higher? i would like to know what you guys think in the comment section on a poll
just going to go quickly through the comment section and say, hello everyone, because i've been having some internet issues again, but it is fixed
hopefully it's going to be fine for this one hourly live stream
and i'm gonna read the comment section right away before we go with bitcoin
you know, i do feel something good here about this major weekly close
i don't think we are going to successfully break down nineteen thousand twenty thousand dollar range just yet, guys
i do think that a bigger relief rally and sideways action is very possible before continuation to the downside
and this is only because of this kind of price action that bitcoin is doing
we had the major drop, we are kind of consolidating here, creating a slightly higher low over here
is this going to be an inverse head and shoulder? we are going to get a bigger relief rally and sideways action before we might even continue to the downside
i think this is a very, very possible scenario at this stage, guys
now what i want to do, first of all, let's go through the comment section
what's up? how are you doing? rodrigo, yeah, man, i think, um, let me just check my mic
let me just confirm with the moderators, i think, um, oh, should be good
um, alan, how are you doing? pray we should have stable internet to enjoy his ta
andy naveen, how are you doing? uh, yeah, f the spanish internet
uh, it's been going pretty good for the last, you know, couple of months
i got my auntie here in the comment section giving me support
scottie, mark dutch, joseph, thank you very much for joining the live stream
vanash, how are you hamad? hello, um, andy's resist andy's internet resistance is six, six, one, eight
i did enter a long position because of this consolidation and because we hit the 50 fibonacci
uh, i did close all of my short position yesterday at this range
okay? i did close all of it because i do see a potential reversal
it's telling me that a bigger relief rally and a liquidity grab from these highs is very, very possible
uh, closed all on my position because i do see a potential reversal
it would be the ideal scenario, of course, you know, hitting that 191, hitting the 196, we just reached 197 yesterday
it's a small, long position that i did put, okay, um, yesterday night because, you know, i was going to add to my position
i just wanted to say, you know, i'm feeling risky at this moment
i did put that long position here on by bit, uh, just a very, very small position, less than one percent risk
uh, was planning to add, you know, once we come down and we would consolidate, you know, at that 191, 196 range
okay, in between the 618 and the um, the 50 fibonacci retracement from this range
you know, if bitcoin does come down to this range and consolidate, it's a major, major resistance zone that we did have here, as you can see on the chart
okay, why did we get this resistance? we got this resistance because this is also a major daily level, okay, from back of december of 2020, and also the alltime high, all right, from 2017, is that zone
um, the price, if it were to come back down here, even better
you know, we do have a projected move from an ascending channel
projected move should be coming all the way down to this nineteen thousand four hundred dollar range
but what i want to show you here also is that we did get a perfect retest, guys, from this ascending channel
i didn't take this short, of course, because i was already in a short, uh
but i did, you know, when i saw this consolidation this week you know, i already closed my position, right? this was a pretty nice trade
and i do see, you know, the price action getting exhausted to exhausted to the downside
even though the price comes all the way down to the low 19 000 range, this could still be a kind of inverted head and shoulder
i am starting to see some people talk about this, all right, on twitter
not on youtube, i don't, um, take a look at many other youtubers
but yes, on twitter, i am starting to see, you know, huge reversal signs
and, you know, i don't like too many people talk about this, because when too many people talk about something, yeah, you actually do the opposite
so, um, but, yeah, very cautious about this potential scenario happening
look how they we had this beautiful retest from this ascending channel, guys
okay? from this um from these higher highs and these higher lows
we talked about this resistance a few days ago to get that potential rejection to come to the low of the channel
it was not only the support of this higher low trend line, it was also a major level here right there
okay, the highest point of this range, all right, has been a respected level
i mean, when you get a resistance or a support of a trend line plus a support or resistance from the price action even better
you adding confluence, and you know, you that's a perfect, nice day trade
nice support from ascending channel that was broken being respected also, guys
you know, the reason why i longed here is because i i did see a consolidation we were and, you know, just thought, you know, this does look like it wants to reverse
i'm looking for that nineteen thousand four hundred dollar range, plus minus a few hundred dollars, that kind of volatility, right? the price action that i want to take a trade, to take a real long position, risking, you know, more than one percent of my capital is this kind of price action over here
i want this kind of price action over here, but i want it all the way down here
you know, if we have that price action once, if we were to come down here and had this price action at the nineteen thousand four hundred dollar area, this is the moment i would say, guys, this is, this is holding as support
we are also getting supported, okay, we'll be also getting supported from this major resistance
okay, that will be turning into support that we have had on the 18th by 19th of june
you want to have your levels ready to take that potential trade, right? look at this solid consolidation
let me just check out the weekly candle, the weekly chart, because you might even have a solid weekly closing open at that range
i'm talking about, the nineteen thousand four hundred dollars, is a weekly close and a weekly open, right there
um, also, you got the low, you know, there's a, you know, you can see here, you can see it's a major zone
okay? it was respected as resistance, but wasn't respected as support
uh? we did have one that won hourly candle here, a little wick
so, yeah, this would be the ideal scenario, getting that drop here in the next coming hours, between today and tomorrow, and having this consolidation
because, you know, you get a lot of people that, you know, don't pay attention, or do not have full experience on the charts, and you might see the price action drop in here from this range, creating one hourly candles very aggressively to the downside
and then i get a bunch of people saying, you know, you said that this level was going to hold
you said that this level, you know, is, is a very strong level
it has, but, you know, if the selling pressure is is very high, you're just going to slice through this range
if you have a bunch of traders, you know, big, big, big traders defending this level, looking for that reversal
and when you see this kind of price action is when you know that they are big traders, defending the drop, defending the range
and that potential reversal to the upside is very, very possible
you gain in height, you gain in probabilities when you see that consolidation
you know, you are looking for that, that, that kind of consolidation at this level
you know, the ideal scenario would be that one consolidation at the 19 400 for a potential long opportunity
and, you know, the second ideal scenario here would be breaking this lower high trend line, okay? get a big, explosive breakout, and not long the breakout, because it can be a fake out, but actually shorting a big resistance levels, okay? because you might see the price action absolutely, you know, exploding here a little bit
a lot of people will fomo in the breakout because they are looking for a reversal
and the price action might just pump, and you might enter, a lot of people might enter late here on on this price action
so we need to pay attention on the big, major resistance levels
it's a major daily zone, and it's a major level that has been respected here on the price action
so what you could see is a big, massive wick here to the upside
this is if we, if, if this ideal scenario were to happen, all right, where you're going to get this consolidation, then the breakout, big move here to the upside
this is a major level where i, you know, this is what i am looking for, if the price action makes any of, you know, bitcoin price actually makes any of this, you know, i have levels too long, and i have levels to short
that is it, have your levels well marked up, get ready to see a reaction, and jump in a trade
you need to have your levels well marked up as resistance and support
two once you hit this level or this level, wait patiently, wait for several hourly candles, wait to see the price action, how it's going to react at these levels, to then potentially take that trade opportunity
and i wanted to talk about before we go through the comment section here and take a look at some altcoins
no, youtube didn't send any notifications to people, so it didn't get too much views
but when i wanted to talk, okay, this is a really cool platform
i don't have funds in there because i basically just use bibet in primix bt
down below you have, um, a code, which is andy15, that you can add up
all right, once you do the deposit, and you'll be getting 15 added to your deposit if it's over 300

okay, combined liquidity of 12 different exchanges, huge amount of liquidity
also, you can sign up in less than two minutes, and you are totally anonymous

make sure to take advantage, all right, of this bonus down below
let's dive in here, straight into the comment section, and let's take a look at matic network
let's take a look at, uh, may i know the price? let's, uh, long the like, short the dislikes
we can take a look at, we can take a look at waves also, guys
waves has been respecting these fibonacci levels that we have been talking about last couple of days to perfection
let's just keep this simple, and let's jump into matic network straight away
but first of all, guys, we've been talking about, you know, waves
of course, ideal scenario would have had that jump up to that 50 fibonacci level where we could have got that beautiful rejection
we've got nice consolidation, nice support, nice resistance, 50 fibonacci from the low to the high
we actually hit the 382, which was mentioned on the live stream
you know, we are probably gonna get rejected here and get a bounce from the point two three six
and why? because the point two three six six, uh, two three six, it's another major fibonacci level
if you go to the one hourly, you can see those nice consolidations on the price, action here on the two three six, getting that beautiful bounce
um, i think probably waves can have some pumpy action all the way to that 790 in the next coming days
what comes first? what comes first? guys? um, let me, uh, let me
are we going to jump first, um, to 17 000, retest the 70 000 lows, or first 24 000
so will bitcoin, will bitcoin hit 17k? 17k range, first or first, then 228 let me see how far away are we here
just going through the comment section here, also, at the same time making the poll
talked about matic on the latest live stream, talking about the ideal shorting scenario for matic
uh, malik is having a little bit of pumpy action for the last couple of days
ideal scenario would be coming all the way up to the um point, 56 cents
i got someone here, i got, um, uh, manatee saying that point, uh, 56 would be the ideal scenario
yeah, i think this was a, is a good zone where we do have a lot of bounces as support ismatic going to manage to arrive to those levels
we had a kind of a descending triangle scenario, massive lower highs here, an insane breakout
you could arguably discuss that this has been kind of the projected move, right from this breakout, gone well below this range and consolidating here for this reversal
of course, five, two, i would be looking for short opportunities
but for the 52 cents to 56 cents range is already a good level for a potential shorting opportunity
if we do get that sideways action, if we do get that kind of volatility at this range, it's very likely going to mean it's going to get exhausted, and you will have time
so, you know, don't rush in a trade thinking that you are going to come down once you're at this level, because you might do something like this
wait for that reaction a few times, several hour, several four hourly candles, even at the range, waiting patiently for the next, you know, kind of leg up and then getting in into a trade
if you are creating these lower highs, get into the highest point possible, of course
it is the value area low from the volume traded in between the 11th of may till the 10th of june
how you look, how you look, how you get supported from the value area high
okay? and you can see the price action getting resistance resistant
this was a kind of an inverse head and shoulder automatic with the resistance low zone at the point 382
adding all of this confluence is absolutely beautiful, because you can see you created an inverse head and shoulder here
look at this inverse head and shoulder on on matic, with the neckline being at the 382
from this high to the low, you creating a neckline on the 382 fibonacci retracement with this inverse head and shoulder right there
if the price automatic network comes down right now to retest the 382, it is very, very possible you will get that next leg up, because you are creating, kind of, um, you are creating these waves here
you got one wave right there, second, third, you might get that, you know, retest of this level
there's a potential, nice, longing opportunity here if matic does retrace
[Music], uh, because i do think higher is possible, at least to the six, one, eight, or even to the, uh, 56, 57 range, and then get that consolidated, consolidation
looking at support here on matic for that continuation to the downside if manic does reverse from this range
look at this beautiful neckline on the four hourly chart from this inverse head and shoulder
you know, the projected move, projected move from this inverse head and shoulder scenario from the breakout, is actually taking you to that 56 cents level
manic is either going to get up there now, or either we'll have a small correction, and this might be a very interesting zone to long okay, you got a nice projected move here
if you have a little consolidation, if you have a little reaction here at their 44, 45 level, it's going to be a very, very interesting zone
trade all the way up to, you know, at least the highs created, which is at 51 cents
i would be protecting my position just in case you do create a double top scenario here, hitting the six, one, eight and already get that resistance and continue down
you need to protect your position, you know, at a double top, you know, once you retest the top, i would be taking profits and try and ride the rest to the move to the upside, to that 56, 56 cents level
this is, you know, just looking at these potential day trades, opportunities, looking at the biggest levels here on matic
okay? we've got shorting opportunity here at 56 range, in my personal opinion, big, major level
you got the value area high from this range being at resistance
let me just right let's take a look at the comment section right away
i hope, um, i hope, i hope, i hope the stream is still doing good
just checking the stream, guys, i'm having a few issues with internet these last couple of days
let me go through the super chats um and see what the people is asking for
i would be very surprised if eagled does break this major resistance here at 64, 65 dollars
the probabilities on egold dropping right now to retest the low area, okay? or at least at least, i would say, the 50 fib level
from this drop, i would go from this low to the high, at least a 50 percent level
50 53 is a level that i would be protecting my position, taking a little bit of profits, just in case you consolidate and, you, you know, you finally break up this this zone, just in case, i mean, you know, ideal scenario would be coming all the way down to retest the lows here at forty dollars
okay, two zone, you know, looking for that potential retest of the lows, which is very, very highly probable also
resistance trendline from low highs, getting very much respected, getting that consolidation
if balls struggle to break the zone, very likely that the bears are going to step in and push the price back down
so, first of all, resistance number one, lower high trend line
resistance number two, a very well bounced level where we did have a consolidation, right over here
this was on the sixth and seventh and eighth of june, before we had the drop on the ninth
matter of fact, this is the biggest spike from the last 40 days traded we can see here
now we're looking at the vpvr from the 10th of may all the way here to the 23rd of may of june
where do we have the biggest point of control? it's right over here, slightly higher, higher
it's at the 69 where's the lowest range here? where's the value area low from this big, nice mountain valley area low is at 65 64
so it's very, very likely that you're not going to manage to break this big zone of volume that we have created inside of this range
confluence number three, if you want to add some more confluence, let's take a look at fibonacci levels
have we been respecting fib levels? let's take a look at the high here to the low right there
we have been respecting the 50 percent fibonacci level from this high of the 31st of may to the low right over here on the 13th of june, from high to low drop
you have an a hitting the 382, an a correction, hitting to perfection, the 382 fibonacci
getting above the 382 and getting rejected at the 50 fibonacci retracement
you know, the probabilities and eagle dropping from this level is just very, very high
i would see, i would say, 75 percent of chance that this is actually going to drop from this range
if you shorted out 62 dollars, you entered a beautiful short position as soon as we start getting below the 382, which is very, very likely to be learning
you know, there's some really nice scalps here, some really nice day trade scalp opportunities
as you can see, um highly probable that this is going to drop
you know, this does look like an abc correction to come back down and retest these low areas
i mean, if i'm talking for for me, what i would do, of course, is, i would be locking profits at 50
i would start protecting my position with the drop, just in case, just in case, you know, the balls are going to find strength and the bears are going to get exhausted, right? we've got, um, let me just check here something, because we've got this level also, we've got higher lows, high lows right there
it might take a few days to come down to the 50 percent, or 618
618, you know, 50, in between 53 and 50, i would be locking, you know, profits, if i was in this trade, because you're probably gonna get this range holded from these higher lows, and it's not going to come and retest the lows
i would protect position just in case you do get that breakdown, then you have a insane risk to reward trade right there
are we actually in an ascending channel, which is likely to continue down
let me just take a channel here, from this low to this point over here, like this
you know, shorting here was a must shorting right there on eagle wood at the 62 range was an absolutely beautiful entry
i mean, if i would have been analyzing egold um properly and, you know, being more aggressive on altcoin trading, which i will be on the tr by the trading competition, guys, if you haven't joined my team, make sure to join, because we also got the telegram group down below
all right? we've got the telegram group for the bibit competition
anybody that joins that is not inside of the team will be eliminated
you know, i will be making a list guys saying, tell me your number, tell me your telegram id, because, um, everybody, you know, proof prove that you are in the competition team
i want to find trades like this, with big, massive, you know, confluence right there
um, you can see here on egold how, you know you only need three points of touch from a, you know, a high and and two higher lows, or a low and two lower highs to create a channel, right? you only need three points of touch
if you have, you know, two points from lows, you already could have created this channel here
you know, when you have this price action, you already have the resistance from this channel
so, absolutely beautiful retest that, you know, you adding more confluence
how many? how many? how much confluence have we been adding? we've been adding this support level right there
from this, you know, this move, we've also got the lower, high trend line here, absolutely insane
if you are under that block of money, you are going to get pushed down 50 fibonacci from this high point to the low
i mean, you know this not, you know, you're adding confluence, and you're adding higher, you adding probability to your trade for that short shorting opportunity
but you know, the probabilities are very high in this having coming down
okay, once you see that move to the downside, you know, don't be afraid and taking profits
worst case scenario, you know, that you could do is is, you know, having your stop loss here at round about that 65, 60, uh, 566 dollars
you know, just four dollars above you come down here to the, you know, 52 50
you get a little consolidation here on the support of this ascending channel, hitting the 618 from this rage, and then you have the breakout of this trend line
um, i mean, i think i'm just going to close my bibet trade, you know
but what if? what if we actually getting supported from this range, from these low areas? you know? what if we're going to get supported, and you're actually going to get that break up, and then this would be a great shorting opportunity
i've been asking to the community, will bitcoin hit 17k first, then 22k? uh, 228 k? i get 61 of the people saying yes
uh, is there any question from you? i have no question from chirad patel
chirad is saying, what do you think will be the worst, best case but, okay, let me go through this
what do you think will be the worst, best case bottom for ethereum compared to other cycles? worst case, uh, worst best case bottom
i did take a look at ethereum here on the weekly and talked about this scenario on the logarithmic chart, right? um, worst case scenario
we did talk about this, right where it's it's something very, very similar
we had this kind of, you know, strong, ascending, higher low trend line, okay, with higher lows, right? look at this
you know, you do, what do you have? first, of course, you have massive price action to the upside, right over here
you have massive price action to the upside once you start creating this distribution event, right where you are seeing, you know, the price having a pretty intensive corrective move
you once you break this high low trend line, then, of course, bear market is confirmed
we broke the high low trend line, looking at the logarithmic, okay? and then, you know, just by just for for entertainment purposes, right? not exact technical analysis here, head and shoulder scenario, kind of projected move right there
you actually dipped below the level and created a double bottom right there
okay? in this bear market, you know, we had a massive, insane pumps in early 2019, q1 q2, massive pump, going from, you know, dollars all the way to three hundred and six seventy dollars
so don't think that we are gonna go to extreme low levels, you know
and not have big relief pumps, okay? probably going to 1 800 or 1000, you know, or even 2 000, and then come back down and create a double bottom, or a slightly lower low, you know, by 2023, late 2023, and start recovering by 2024
worst case scenario, i would say, you know, we are going to get this projected move
this is not an head and shoulder scenario, right? it's, we are respecting very well with this, this high low trend line, but you have this kind of, it's not a head and shoulder scenario
this, even though, yeah, even though this is higher, this is a higher peak, and this one, it is a higher peak
anyway, just looking at, you know, entertainment purposes this kind of price action, you broke the trend line from the higher lows right there
you know, if we were to look at the similar projected move, or even lower, you know, take a few percentage down lower, you know, from this head scenario to the neckline
from that breakout, you know, we are already at this low level
you can come lower, but you can see here we met the kind of the target
so if we were to add a little bit of lower here, okay, if we were to add a little bit lower from this breakdown on ethereum, and, you know, this is not exact science, but if we were to take a look at this kind of scenario and relief rallies to come in in the next, uh, coming months, big relief rallies
okay, if we were to see this scenario on ethereum, something similar? okay? no, it's never the exact same thing
taking the highest point here and adding a little bit to the volatility here, this potential volatility, you know, my worst case scenario on ethereum, i think, would be in between, you know, 600 and 800 dollars
is already a nice accumulation zone for me on ethereum, no doubt in my mind
crypto is growing, you know, um, adoption is actually growing
there's a little bit of interest going down now, but people do realize that, you know, cheap levels, you know, when prices of assets go down, it's time to buy
so, you know, just by looking at this kind of projected move from this, this, this move to the downside, with the volatility, i would say 600, 700 dollars would be kind of the worst case scenario
very, very attractive um price levels to to accumulate ethereum
you know people that say, you know, ethereum's going down to 400, 300, um, yeah, when we've, when we've got an alltime high of, uh, you know, almost five thousand dollars, and you are going to be trading at, you know, maybe eight, we've already hit 800 range, uh, below at 900
you know, if you are gonna be trading at six, seven hundred dollars with an alltime high of almost five thousand dollars, you know, these are already pretty, pretty attractive levels to to to buy up
you will be accumulating relief pumps, and then you will be breaking alltime highs at some point in the next coming years
ethereum is the number one blockchain that mo, most of the cryptocurrency projects are built on, sandbox, decentraland chain link, a lot of d5, snx, you know, rv, uh, a lot of gaming projects, it's number one blockchain
if we do come down to, you know, 700, 600 range, it's going to be a very important level
you might just be trading there for, uh, for a couple of weeks, or not even that, before you get a big relief pump, and maybe come down and retest those levels before you actually have, you know, the next cycle starting
okay? people are in an extreme panic just because we've had, you know, several weeks of, of of downside action
anyway, your question is, where is the extreme low in my opinion? worst best case scenario for accumulation zone? i see, i see six, six, seven hundred dollars range, worst case scenario for ethereum
from alltime high, we would, you know, what is ethereum down now? it is 80
if we do go down to 600, it would be round about, you know, 87, almost 90
all coins go down over 95 percent, mid cap, 90 percent, i would say, ethereum, round about 90, 80, 90 percent from all time high, good accumulation levels
what is bitcoin down from alltime high? you know, if you're down 80, it's already really good accumulation levels
so, yeah, 80 percent would be hitting that thirty thirteen thousand dollar range, almost twelve thousand dollars
you know, bitcoins down, you know, from alltime high here in 2017, to the extreme low levels, it was 84 percent
the alltime high, you know, the alltime low level, sorry, the low levels from the bear market, from the alltime high, are not going to be that aggressive
i think it's highly improbable that we're going to go more than 80 percent
last cycle we dipped alltime low, from the alltime high to the alltime low, was 84
82 is 12 000, i would be extremely attractive levels to accumulate bitcoin
we are probably not even gonna hit, we are probably not even going to hit those levels
you know, we are all, we have already been down 72, 74 when we did hit, you know, almost, you know, below 18 000
75 percent down from all time high is already very, very attractive levels to accumulate
slightly lower, 80 would be best case scenario to accumulate bitcoin, which would be around about that, you know, 12, 13 000 range
people calling for, you know, i've seen people calling for nine thousand dollars even, you know, lower, even lower
you know, the lows here created back in december of 2018 and also the the march 2020 crash lows
it's very highly improbable, guys, very highly improbable we go down there
that would be my alltime low here for for this, um, for this bear market cycle
you think friday option expire pump btc? it is very, very possible
i think most of the people, you know, with options are in put positions
you could see that, you know, option expire give a big pump on bitcoin
most of the people are looking for lower so, you know, you know that friday expiration can give that pump on bitcoin
we have seen that, you know, inverse correlation on before, on on options expire
you could see that massive, big relief rally just for all of those, you know, bearish options
you know, you need to get, you need to get all of those bearish people liquidated, get a bunch of liquidity
is this not a nice cnh uh? coupling handle on the btc four hour lease
if you are looking this as the resistance, i mean, cupping handles are usually a bullish pattern, especially, you know, if they're in at the top of an uptrend
okay? you usually see cupping handles at the top of an uptrend, not at the lowest part, but the ideal scenario would be at the height
if you are asking me if this is a cup and handle, you know, i would assume the only kind of cup and hunter that i see here is, you know, even looking at the two hourly, not the four hourly
just to zoom out here, see a little bit of more price action would be from this 215 k range, right? from this level, right? this, this kind of scenario being the cup and this being the handle, you could arguably discuss, yes, i mean, i wouldn't, i wouldn't, i wouldn't trade this
it could also be an inverted head and shoulder, very, very, very, very ugly one, you know, very, very ugly one
but of course, if this were to be a cup and handle, you've got the resistance zone right there
yeah, i wouldn't say, you know, take a look at the lower highs right there
i mean, has this been a descending channel? it has been broken, breaking resistance
it does look like that bitcoin might have some bullish momentum right now
this, this being the handle, this been the resistance at the 214, 215, this been the cup, it's been the handle, uh, i don't know
i would, uh, wouldn't be paying too much attention that projected move from this from the low to the high, if it gives us a very nice level
i am looking for big, big resistance levels already at the 228, like i discussed at the beginning of the livestream, 228, you know, if we do pump that to that level and get rejected, i mean, no, sorry
and we do get a consolidation, i would be looking for shorting opportunities at that range
of course, if we do hit that range, you know, only shorting in the short term, we could get very much respected and start trading this this level
guys, we've had such an aggressive drop, you know, that bigger relief rallies is, you know, very, very likely
it is very, very likely, rolling down from this range, to go down to thirteen thousand dollars
and with my experience looking at the charts, this kind of price action, this kind of price action, i think, yeah, relief rallies is very, very possible, big relief rallies before continuation to the downside
uh, smashing that light from madrid for my man, says, seb seb, how are you doing, my man? hope you had a fantastic flight
says mark dutch, yes, yeah, i think, yeah, flights are pretty safe, so, um, yeah, he's alive
mark dutch, seb joseph, once again, thank you very much for the insane support
i've got scotty here also giving, you know, always commenting in the comment section
these these these trend lines that, uh, someone, you know, that is five years old can do
let me, i'll take a look at the cup and handle right now, but look at the dxy, right? we've been having these trend lines
you know, just looking at the highs, the lows, bounces from support resistance trend lines, and, you know, channels, absolutely easy, easy, easy, peasy
big consolidation at that trend line that we were talking about, okay? and then created a nice solid base right there
if, you know, dxy was going to get this consolidation and get rejected from this trend line that we have been talking about for ages, then it's very likely bitcoin will be getting that relief pump
if we do get, you know, dxy helps very, very much to see the movements on bitcoin
not instantly, but, um, it does help, you know, for the next coming days
if dxy is going down, bitcoin still, you know, consolidating, you could see that big pump if the dxy is going down
so it does help to to see, you know, potential future movements on bitcoin
anyway, dxy, we broke this lower high trend line, had a beautiful break up
where did we get, uh, you know, resistance at the exact support resistance level right there
my take on the dxy is this, i think dxy is gonna go lower in the next coming weeks
if we do hold this resistance level on the dxy, and i can see your cup and handle scenario here
okay, on the four hourly, we've got the highs here with a little bit of volatility
we've got this high, we've got these highs, right? cupping handle
you create a resistance, alltime high, well, high, and then you create the round formation
i mean, it is a scenario, of course, dxy and a big, massive uptrend
i think it's just getting exhausted by breaking down from these higher lows, creating this higher high, big consolidation, getting the resistance from the trend line
will it be time for the dxy to lose a little bit of steam in the immediate, short term, for the next coming weeks? i think so
this would help bitcoin to actually, you know, finally have that relief rally from this scenario, uh? and then potentially continue back down
you know, this was, this was, this would be what we were looking for, big relief rally on bitcoin
and, you know, big correction on the dxy, after having this massive, big runup, big, big runup on the dxy
is it time for a little bit of more a cool off on the dxy? i think so
mark dutch, joseph, mark duchess is, mark is bullish on tinder
and martin, okay, if we were to go with these levels, if we were to go with these levels, right? um, just speculation right there
we know that the cupping handle projected move is getting the lowest part of the cup
okay, we were to follow textbook technical analysis projection, you know, from that breakout, you know, dxy going all the way up to the 108, 110, that would, that would ignite bitcoin going down to 10k levels
i would say 12, 14k, absolutely, if we dxy is going to be looking extremely strong with this kind of scenario, going to that 110
yeah, definitely see, um, bitcoin going down to, uh, at least 14k
i do see bitcoin going down to that range if this were to play out
but should i let the rest run it? just run a liquidity price in to any six, 6900
you know, this is the dump happened, the very aggressive dump happened
i am expecting lower, you know, we might pop up from this range, or we might come down and retest that nineteen thousand four hundred dollar level first
nineteen thousand four hundred dollar range, plus minus a few hundred dollars because of the volatility
i would be extremely interested, like i said at the beginning of the live stream, to long this range, guys
of course, if i, if the price action does this, would i be losing money? no, only my portfolio would be going down from my bitcoin longterm huddle position
and a big consolidation at this range would be the highest, you know, probability to get that next leg up here on bitcoin
will it break out with, you know, with steam? why not? i mean, yeah, you know, these are reversal signs
you are creating this level, this level, big daily zone, your higher low right over here
i, you know, i'm looking for that break up, or i'm looking for that move down, consolidate, get into a trade here, at this 19 400 range, i am looking to get into trade there
i only need a few trades a month to make, to to make my month, or to make a couple of months even
where are we going? i'm shorting, i'm longing, and i'm looking for the highest probability trade always, um, we just need a couple of trades a month to make huge gains
do you think that, do you think there is a chance 70k could be the bottom? says anthony, absolutely
when you get so much people looking for much lower price levels, you know, it's like when people were calling for 100k at these ranges, so people calling for 10k levels at these ranges after this aggressive drop, you know, could indicate that this maybe has been the bottom
but what is most likely to happen is getting a big relief rally, and i mean big as in, you know, 25k, even 30k, in the next coming months
at some point, you know, at some point you are inside of the bear market at some point, because you're not going to go down in a straight line
you know, you are going to get these relief, big rally pumps at some point, right? maybe hitting 30k levels in the next few months
very likely you will be having, you know, another big rejection, and then another several months of downside action, potentially even retesting the lows below nineteen thousand dollar, eighteen thousand dollars, if this were to be the short term low, uh, and and then, you know, and then have another another bounce up
if you do see, start seeing bitcoin at 25k, at 30k, you know, we are gonna see a lot of people turning very, very bullish
i am looking for a large disbelief, a large disbelief rally in the next coming months
will it be next month? will it be in in september? this is the million dollar question
um, andy, would you consider creating a buy bit copy trade profile? yes, i i would
by end of the summer, beginning of, you know, september, october, i am doing a training course
i will be extremely active on a private discord group that i will be creating for many people right? sharing charts and trades every single day
i like to swing trade, because swing trade is so much easier, you know, looking for levels, level to level, you know, and just put the position, protect your position, and just chill let the price action do whatever it needs to do
um, but yeah, i will be focusing more on on day trading and scalping, you know, by september, um, and making this discord group, making the probably doing a, a, a bribe to copy trade
all this is, we'll be very much, um, looking now, look, it'll be raven very much looking for that for for the, uh, after the summer
chill out a little bit, do the live streams, do a little bit of trading
competition is now, of course, inside of the summer, focus for the competition
what is the the russian ruble forex? what is the ticker symbol? for the russian river
but, yeah, the best performing asset, yeah, because it did have a huge drop, i would assume
have you smashed a like button? guys, smash up that like button
let me just double check, uh, because probably be ending the live stream
what about your merch collection? also? russell, yes, absolutely
definitely gonna get a merch collection out okay, um, you know, bitcoin said no, not andy legends, or something like that, or bitcoin census legends, you know
or what's up my crypto legends? what's up my crypto legends with a bitcoin logo? you know, definitely gonna get some merch out there for the community
you know, i want to be having my, you know, what's up my crypto legend tshirt
these altcoins, these dangerous altcoins, with these movements
our room look pretty, pretty, pretty good for a shorting opportunity right at this level
it was a very difficult short though, i gotta say, very, very difficult short
we're absolutely insane shorting opportunity right there on roon, hitting the 61865 fibonacci
anyway, looking at roon, let's zoom in on the chart, because we have lost the summer lows, okay? of of 2021
let me zoom out a little bit on the threeday chart a little bit here, to check out these levels i've got some white horizontal lines here
they're all major, big daily levels, major, big zones here from price action happened right over here in december and january of 2021
as you can see, ultimate low level here, insane support level
let's fast forward and see how we have been doing at these levels
now it looks like that roon is ready for a bigger relief rally, guys, a bigger relief rally
220 level, it looks like that we are kind of creating an inverse head and shoulder scenario
we're probably going to get rejected from this, you know, major level from back in december of 2020
you know, it's, you know, it doesn't mean, we did break down pretty nicely
if you do create that inverse, you know, you are creating that inverse heading, shorter range, right there
25260 is exactly the 618 235 50 level, also, where you could get that rejection, because it is also, it is also a major zone here
yeah, i wouldn't, i would take this, um, i would take this level out of the way
we've had a very, um, we've just sliced through this level, so i'm going to take it off
so, 50 fibonacci retracement from this high to the low is right over here, at the 235 on roon
you could get heavily rejected from this range, or you could have a little bit of more volatility and come up to the 25260 range
you are looking at that 50, 60 fib level from this high, from the start of the drop down, nice range to short in between 235 and 260, waiting for that volatility reaction and then jumping into a trade on roon
let's just take a look at vpvr levels here for you to confirm, big resistance and support ranges
um, so we're not getting much confluence with the volume profile, only with the chart price action
so, yeah, this big, big zone here, big, big zone, we are creating an inverse ending shorter right there
you know, really bigger relief rally is more, very likely on rooney
especially if bitcoin does behave bitcoin pumps, you know, it's very likely going to drag some altcoins to the upside
it's, you know, it's supposedly, it's the pioneer crypto with interoperability interoperability in between blockchains, you know, between ethereum finance, uh, you know, all different blockchains, you know, to have that interoperability, thought chain supposedly is the number one
beautiful relief rally, very likely to happen in the next coming months with george thor chain
i don't have any funds there because i already have my funds on private and private bt
only if you deposit point zero, zero, four bitcoin, which is, i think it's less than two hundred dollars today
a huge amount of, you know, um exchanges here are, to add liquidity, bank grade multisecurity
you can make an account anonymous in less than two minutes, um, to trade with take advantage of those bonuses down below, guys
i'll be doing a video update very lightly afterwards, or i'll be trying to do another live stream
i usually try and explain at the beginning of the stream what i do think isn't, you know, what is going to happen on bitcoin
what are the major levels? if we do drop back down to that 19 400 range, i expect this level to hold
now, if this level does not hold, if this level, you know, has massive, you know, volatility of the downside, if we do have a big, massive drop, guys, this will not be a longing opportunity
only if we see this kind of price action is when i will say this is likely going to hold, and we are going to finally have that explosive break out to the upside, bigger relief rally
you're going to start trading level to level, guys, trying to make some pretty nice gains
want to see this news regarding cardano? check it out on the bitcoin center website
we post every single day, you know, different news and technical analysis ideas
thank you very much for joining, and i will see you in the next one
one second, i'm just gonna give everyone the content, the content, uh, oh, yeah
where am i? what do i do here? why am i so confused? and you're like, why is she talking to yourself so much? because i don't have anyone else to talk to
because right now i'm trying to give everyone the content that i am live
how are you? is everything okay? is everything okay? with everyone? we got 12 people in here, 16 people guys
we did go through this, uh, this morning, and we can see that the market is right now retesting the fibonacci levels that we did have
how are you guys? how are you guys? just one second, one second, i'm going to make a video to sami
if you want to be on my live stream right now, you have the link in the description down below the video
i am looking for a sell opportunity right now on bitcoin join
let's see if samick can take that one and put it up on our other social, social, social medias
so just one second, i will create this right? i'm just gonna send it, and then we're just gonna go in directly to the charts
and i'm also, i, of course, need to give him the link to my little live stream
how are ya? oh, my case here is everything okay with you? hello, hello
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that
i thought i needed a siesta, and we have the seagulls out here
youtube, i don't know if that's what you say, uh, i feel like btc will fall
so that was, um, what is about 30 minutes ago that they had to talk
so i'm in one position on bitcoin and one on ethereum right now
i think when did we take these positions? we took these positions, was it yet? no, yesterday
i want to kill them, but i can't do that, right? okay, looking, we can go to dx y right away
so this morning's live stream that we didn't have, we were at this candle, we had, whoa
what i didn't so when when i take my i'd love to wake up to bird sounds
what i always tell you is that the market, when i use my trend line, after the next lower high, i'm changing it to this
but usually what happens when we see the break of the trend line
why i still have it was because i wanted to see if we broke below it for a retest and then see the market drop even more
and can you see also how precisely so i use it on the four hourly and on the three hourly charts
we came down exactly and retested the support, the resistance trend line, again, also the the fibonacci level
so since yesterday, i used this support because if we broke below the support, we could definitely have seen the market continue even more to the downside, right? but now we retested
we closed above, and now we see the market push, uh, push to the upside
okay, so if this, uh, in 20 minutes, this candlestick will close
and we did have two fake outs, one two, withheld this support
so why why i focus on, why i focus on dxo i use right now, is because it's because we, um, when, if, if the xy goes up, bitcoin usually, you know, goes down, right? um, okay, so what we're what we're looking at right now on remember, this morning we were looking at the five daily chart
and i am guiding myself with the close of the previous five data charts
um, because i think the the the close of this is really important
and every time we have, so not every time, but a lot of the times when we have this type of week
and with the drop of overall that we do have, i do expect the market to come back down to potentially 17 040
um, i will try to go through as many players as possible, so not staying too long on bitcoin
um, okay, so what i spoke about this morning was the close, and that a close of previous five daily uh candlestick
and i spoke about that if we break below this level and see it retest from below, this, for me, is a sign that the market will continue, uh back down
and we did close below it, and we can right now see that we are retesting this level
another thing that we also need to have in mind is that, based on the support trend line right here, we broke the previous higher low, and we are also retesting that level at twenty thousand four hundred and eighty two
how are ya guys? if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
and, you know, we just want to share these thoughts with other people too
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that, because i do these live streams and daily updates about cryptocurrencies every single day, seven days a week
and don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on by a bit right now, up to four thousand and, uh oh, it didn't change
you can see, receive a bonus up to four thousand and four hundred and fifty dollars right now on by bit through bitcoin senses
another thing that i will do sometimes, what i do is that i use the previous, one of the last, uh, higher lows that we do have on the 15 minutes chart, and i'll show you what this baby can do
right? so we are dragging the support train around trend line from the last higher low
and we don't want to cut any candles don't ask me why i do this, because i just back test it one day and i figure this out myself
so what we do is that we're taking the support trend line, we did break the the bigger support trend line, uh? but with the help of that 15 minutes high low, we connect it
sometimes we can also, obviously do this, but i would actually like to have it like this, um
and what i'm gonna do is that i will drag a fibonacci from 20773 back down to the low of twenty thousand three hundred and ninety five
so what i can expect the market to do right now is to pull back up and retest
remember that we're also retesting twenty thousand five hundred and thirty, also, combined with the support trendline that i just explained to you
i would, i do believe, we can come up to the 50 sometimes, to come back up and retest the 60 also
but the 50 retest can be at thousand five hundred and sixty four sixty one point eight percent is twenty thousand six hundred and three
i'm so happy that you share everything, because guys, you're so much better when it comes to the fundamentals than i am
so this is potentially, as i said, i'm already in a selfdecision right now on bitcoin
we do have the push right now, so this could be where we see the retest
now, when the market is going down, a lot of people are sick and tired of me that, oh, natalie is always selling the market
just imagine when the market starts to continue back up and we start to buy the market, do you know how happy you guys gonna be when that comes
because the time will come, i think, at the end of the summer, and within two months or so
um, because that was also something that um, andy also a youtuber on bitcoin census, obviously the best guy ever
he also taught me, or showed me before, we had a call together, and he showed me that during the month, i also know this, but he showed me on the chart exactly how bitcoin is very, very slow during summer
and then when at the end of summer, beginning of um, host, we're saying in swedish, i don't know how to say that in english right now, then you start to see the market
can you see how we almost come comes up and retest this level? this is beautiful, guys
so, yeah, so i do believe that we will have the bullish momentum coming after summer
the market is only it needs to go back down for them to continue up
uh, as you as we look at right now, i would, you know, overall
okay, so take profit one is thousand three hundred and eleven
and say profit three, uh, nineteen thousand nine hundred and ninety
so this is more of swing trade, depending obviously, how the market does move
uh, but in 19 652, and that is um is that? what is that? no, that is the higher time frames, fibonacci
so based on that, we came up and retested, uh, the higher time frames we want to take profit one is technically nineteen thousand six hundred and fifty six
and take profit three, eighteen thousand two hundred and ninety
it's pretty interesting to see live how the market is reacting to these levels
so what we're gonna do is that we're gonna take this one and give the market will give us an alert so we can go and look at the other coins
it's pretty i mean, we need some movements, uh, we need some space, obviously
can you see? we almost came back up to retest this level? but we can obviously pull back up a little bit more, though
but hey, now where should take profit? my take profit is at 17 040 on bitcoin
so my mine is mine is that i do have mine pretty far away, because i do expect the market to drop, obviously
let's go to ethereum, and then i'm gonna go into the charts, uh, for you guys
and we do already have the setup things this morning, so we're just gonna make a quick one
what we also can do is that we drag another support trendline right here
um, this is not the best one, to be honest, but we are retesting the 50 right now
so this is, can you see? um, i'm gonna go freak out again every time i'm like, can you see what's happening? like, i've never done this before
i've done treating since 2018, and i'm still as happy every time i see this happening
then we drag the fibonacci from the last high at one thousand seven hundred and seventeen
and we did already retested fifteen sixty one percent right here
we can also use the previous higher low, if we, i mean, i'm already in the trades, but let's see if the market break down, and we would potentially see a break again of this previous higher loan and rita's from below
because right now we are above the last higher low right here
what i do expect the market to do now is to create the lower high, and then see the drop the fibonacci level on this, uh, short
but based on the higher time frames fibonacci that also came back up and retested, take profit 1 is 1020
and and this is where i do have my own take profit when it comes to, uh, my my own ethereum trade
but based on the fibonacci here, we can also come back down to 905 dollars
thank you for helping nerdy like me understand the market structure
why you guys are crazy? why are you trading against the trend? why are you trading against trend? it's not good
i mean, you do whatever you want to do, but we've been talking about these guys
i know you can't you see? but i'm no financial advisor, so you do whatever you want to do, right? hello rosh
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
and of course, my beautiful, beautiful moderators will now give you the link to the beautiful telegram community that me natalie have
this is where you can be more in contact with me and other lovely people
valeria, why are you nervous? okay, we have a drop of matic right now
but, you know, so when we, when we're looking at magic, we drag fibonacci from with 0630 um back down to 0346
so let's see what's i'm not even gonna answer the question about my fibonacci anymore
okay? so that trend line is not something that i will look at
i wouldn't, i wouldn't do anything at the moment, i would want matic to break below this level, create the lower low, and then potentially continue back up to retest
uh, the i don't know where exactly the retest will be, but now we do have the drop
so i need to, i need to see the market break below the previous higher low at 491, give me the lower low, and then i want to see the market starts to pull back up
and at that point, i will take a fibonacci from high to low, and that will give me the 50 and 61 percent, and then i would sell the market
and why i want the market to break below this level is because you can also see the market push back up again from it, right? so for me not to be get faked out, um, uh yeah
it's i know, you know, i recognize people and they s they ask the same things
if you don't know, i don't want to sound like a, i do apologize for that
but my fibonacci levels, uh, something that i bought from my mentor long time ago
and why i don't share it now is because it is his work, and i don't want to share his work for free
um, but, uh, fibonacci level, i do use 50 and 61 percent as a target for me to, uh, take my trades from
we, we need to go to bitcoin because you saw the market pull back up a little bit
so on bitcoin right now, we are retesting the support trendline that i did have
so it's a pretty, pretty low, uh, level to look at, uh, we can also pull back up to, uh, 20, 603
so yeah, now it's kind of just a waiting game to see if this, but we do have a pretty strong 30 minutes candlestick
let's see how it looks on ethereum, guys, it's great to see your smile
and, yeah, same thing on ethereum, can you see how perfectly so we tried to break above
we did retest the 50 at 109 right now on ethereum, looking great
can you see how perfectly this is like? can you see the clothes after fifty percent? 109? you
what do they have? a special smile? not to use encore, just to check levels
there's so many things when it comes to, you know, when you're looking at trading, you when you're looking at trading view, and you're looking at all of, you know, sidelines, time circles, cycle lines
okay, so what i'm doing right now on um, on xrp, i am highlighting one of the previous uh supports that we did that we saw this huge push from this level, and we are below it
and the next level for us to come back down to is around zero point two thousand four hundred and sixty
so this is on the two weekly charts, the higher time frames ethereum crossing downtrend
we can have a pullback up to 03 270, if the market is not dropping right now, or potentially 03 273 if these levels is, uh, because you can see the break of structure right here
but take profit one is zero point three thousand two hundred and fifty
take profit three, zero point three thousand two hundred and thirty
i always, uh, zero point three thousand two hundred and sixteen
can you see? can you see? are you blind? can you see? um, i want to see what else you want me to look at after ltc market is going down exactly from these levels, guys
i'm already, so, as i said, i'm already in the positions right now on bitcoin and on ethereum, so i'm, i do have my take profit on bitcoin at 17 040
and don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to 4 000 and thousand four hundred and fifty dollars right now through bitcoin census
and bitcoin census, obviously, uh, you have the link in the description down below the video
but we are inside fibonacci level as 5410 and 5654 dollars go down to the lower time frames
so we could see we have already retested 549 to 5 but we can also retest it again, pull back up a little bit
55007 dollars at 618 percent, could be the market from these levels, see the drop
um, but if we're looking at the higher time frames, i would like the market to break below 5408, and that will also be potentially the break of the support trend line that we do have, and then see the retest market then continues back down
um, so everything depends if i, you know, if, uh, i'm gonna, i'm aggressive at right now at, you know, if i would sell the market at ltc, i will not do it
um, or if i do have some patient and wait for because if i take a trade from here, i can get get faked out, because we just might have a bigger push to the upside, right? um
but i'm also using these previous highs that we did have a fake up front, fake out
and from a from this resistance, we can see the market pull back up and retest the resistance one last time from below, and then, you know, you see the drop from it
so everything depends if i want to be aggressive, or if i want to have some patient, wait for the break of structure, um, and then give the lower high, potentially against the support trend line that we will break
hello, maze, my predictions in his btc will fall down to 19 000 today
let's see, guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that
please take your time like the video so you can help me with the algorithm, so we can reach out to more people
share this channel also with your friends, family, if they are, if you know someone that wants to start to trade
i'm no financial advisor, but i do have very, i do have a lot of experience when it comes to the charts
so definitely share it with them, because trading change lives
trading when you have the right, uh, when you have the right people around you when it comes to trading, you can't, you know, we we had sleep and golden, our girl sleeping golden
it took her like one month, and she just now is going crazy on the charts
um, if you haven't already gone into my youtube channel, go inside and just, i have crypto trading for beginners
you can do what everything that i do, you can do this on every, every single um, every single chart, forex index, gold oil, you can do it everywhere
part two is definitely something that i suggest, because that's the basic of trading
trend lines support resistance zones, supply and demand zones go down
to back test with me, you have the the back testing with trend lines, where i explain exactly, oh my god, to my show where i show exactly where she lies it
how i use trend lines, uh, supply and demand zones and fibonacci
i saw your live video, missed on time, and i follow your technical analysis
but i also obviously want to tell you that, um, everything is a probability
so if i choose to take trays and i share that with you, remember that stoploss, you stoploss gets hits
okay, so what we do on solana now, what we do on salon, is that we drag fibonacci from 4263 back down to 2851
um, and that is also the previous support, previous lower low
so we are right now looking at a lower, low probability where we can see the market drop from here
what we also can do is that we're using this um candlestick right here, between um 32, 3712 and 3803 dollars
what did i take away? which one was it? okay, so we're trying to break this previous resistance at 3728
if we would see that the market is closing below 3716, and you see rita's from below, that, for me, is a sign that the market will go down
so i wouldn't do anything at the moment, because you don't know if the market will continue back even more to the upside
yeah, because we're trying to break, uh, we're right now trying to break above the 618 percent
so, yes, sign if the market breaks below, retest from below, uh, from, oh, yeah, from below around 3729
but another thing also, because we, we would want, obviously, be another confirmation, is that we have patience
and we wait for the market to break the support trend line that is representing the higher highs and higher lows
if we break it, and we break the previous higher low at 3617, 17, break mark, decrease the lower low, pulls back up to create the lower high
if this is the case, now see the push back up, and then this is where i sell the market
b and b, okay, so what i did before, we are inside fibonacci level right now on bnb, uh, fibonacci levels between 202 and 260 for the market to potentially reverse back to the upside
but we do, i mean, we do have some huge, you know, the market is going down, obviously
he's just spitting where he's like, oh, he heard someone speak spanish
so like, for example, if i say that i'm swedish, and someone, you know, oh, you know, swedish, and then they say, like, some words, i'm like, yeah, exactly
okay, so looking at, uh, looking at the, looking at the previous high of 203 and 231
um, we can also use this, because the market, this is a resistance [Laughter], yeah, whatever
sometimes it's just easier to do it, to do, uh, the without talking, it goes so much faster
okay, so if we're looking at b and b, obviously i do expect the market to drop from here
um, and i wouldn't do anything at at the moment, because you can all just see rita's from the support trend line
but if we see a break of 2243 dollars, market creates the lower low, because that is the break of structure
okay? because this is a high low, market needs to break the uh, lower low, pull back up to create the lower high
usually what i get, what i do is that i drag fibonacci from the high to that low market, giving me the lower high at the 15 61 percent fibonacci levels
but if we see the market drop from here, um, take profit one, uh, 218
and that is, that is at the previous 210 is also at the um, the low, the low
why did i even read that? i know someone asked me about use 30
um, we also use the support trendline, but it's pretty far away right now
if we see, hi natalie, can you please look in the forever time frame at how much this community loves you
so if bitcoin, sorry, if use 30 now is breaking below 30 557, we can definitely see a retest off this level
but remember when i talked about this, uh, 15 minutes chart at 15 minutes, last high low, one of the last higher lows we connected
but we also came back up and retested this previous supply zone between 30 666 and 30 601
can you see? this is why, this is why you should follow my channel
if you haven't already hit the notification, if you haven't already join my community, bitcoin census natalie community, you need to do it right now
can you see, like you see it in front of your eyes, what i do? and if i can do it, you can also do it
okay? not only a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of hard work
you know how many years i wanted to kill myself to be where i am today, looking at the chart like this? guys? um angie and you give sick trace sometimes i was, yeah, i would say this is magic, but i know it's a lot of work behind it
i've been doing this every single day since 2018, every single day
because i moved from one city to another, so i was able to sit and just look at the charts
but in this these back testing sessions that i do have, i just show you what i've been doing every single day since 2018
but this is exactly, this is exactly how i do it, or how we should do it
whatever you want to be good at, you have to practice at least ten thousand hours for you to be good at it
i am already in two set positions, one on bitcoin, one on ethereum, on by bit since yesterday
i've been very patient with this because i trust my analyzes, and i rather have my stop loss getting taken than take myself out and miss this whole trade
i would just wait for the market to continue back down even more
um, don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars
i will, you know, i just need to talk about something else sometimes, you know
and if you want to be part of the community that i do have, we are
please put 11 in the chat if you're excited for your future trading from today and you join my community, our community
put one one one if you're excited for you to be the best trader ever
when you get good at reading, when you get good men, have the good mentality, because the mentality is the one stopping you
your life will change, not only for you, but the people around you, and your kids, your future kids
so never stop, never stop believing yourself, if i can do it, you can do it
but the only thing that stops you do you have the passion for it? do you want to do it? trading is also very hard
but usually why the fear is coming? what the i would just finish looking at your live stream from yesterday and see that you predicted perfectly perfectly on et
sometimes we stop, loss, get hit but who cares? because the next time you will be in profit, or i will be profit
but what i want to say is that when we have, when we have fear around the market, and this is all i only take it from how i can reflect on it, it's either i don't understand what i look at and i choose to take a trade anyways, because i don't have the patience
okay, so patience gives you fear, because you just jump into something that you have no clue about what you're doing
over leverage is one of the the most, most, most stupidest things that we can do
i over leverage sometimes, definitely, because but it's not something that i would especially, not would recommend someone to do when you are a beginner
angel number 601 is the symbol of focus and release of anxiety
your guardian angles are telling you to relax and focus on your goals in life without being afraid of failure
and if you don't know what heyoka impact it they they change the world
now, remember, back testing um this previous higher low, we tried to connect it with the break
i always try to connect it with the fibonacci, because that crazy
how can i join the community? oh, tommy, lauren will give you the link, and we will also pin it in the chat soon
so lauren will give you the link to the okay, the market is dropping, dropping, guys
don't don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy it up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty dollars
this is uh, a great, great, um, it's a great platform, uh, for swing trading
and on ethereum, i have my take profit at 930, because these are key levels, pretty far away
because when we hold the position for a longer time, it is the low fees that we want
right? listening to you, analyzing the graphs together with you has has taught me more than any book
can you hear? if it's not, if it's not the seagulls, it's something else
even though this is the retest that i was looking for, but you can see it on the lower time frames
okay, what i did, remember, i took the support trendline, combine it with the last higher low
but looking at the one minute chart, can you see how the market did retest this level
and from that retest, i said, if they will give me a retest, we have already moved 800 and 870 pips from this level
and we also broke the support trend at the support look at dxy
okay, are you? and does he also have that? and then throws her computer to the seagulls
well, now the market has already okay, so what we can do is that we go back to where what the levels, uh? okay
can you see on the 15minute chart, can you see how perfectly we came back up and retested the fibonacci levels, looking at solana, go down
but what i also said, because some of the charts looks a little bit differently, obviously
but if we, if if i haven't already, i haven't sold the market on we could, if we break below the support trend line and see retest on the lower time frames from below, that for me, is a sign that the market will go back down
because at that point, this is only a fake out from this resistance that we do have
i don't understand why this pen is like going crazy, like real resistance
drop with a little bit more patience, wait for the market to break
are you in shorts right now? yes, i, um, i saw, i've been in short since yesterday on bitcoin and on ethereum, i saw the market yesterday at 20 750
this is like so good that you you know what what i do more than what i would myself do not only, excuse me, do you use, uh, i use, i use obs
that is why it's so good to be a trader, because you sell the market, you earn profit, and you buy the market and you're in profit
we can go into it, but looking, no one asked about bat though, i remember, because i was anxious since yesterday i saw you today
uh, was it mana? i think someone asked about mana before, too
because i know if i don't have the patient, i'm going to lose my traits
so why, why do something stupid like that? i'm not saying you're stupid
that's the difference between the people that will become great traders and the ones that will be stuck forever in drawdown, or always be, you know, at break even, is the one that don't have the patient
i mean, uh, we did retest the, uh 50 at nine zero points in nine thousand and one hundred and ten um
if we see a big drop, take profit one will be seven thousand two hundred
and take profit three, four thousand seven hundred and ninety eight
but i could also use previous support, because these things pretty far away
i would either use the previous low at also at 8176 um, or 7790 or 7713
so this was something that we went through this morning on link
oh, can you see how beautifully? oh, guys, so i always have morning live streams, uh, from, uh, 8 am, swedish time, so that is one hour before london session
and i do recommend everyone to be on those live streams, because we do have better setups from the morning
um, so this, you know, the trade has already, you know, came to the entry targets, and now the market is dropping
so the we did have the this fibonacci, we were looking at this level this morning
can you see how perfectly the market consolidated between the supporting at this the 15 61 percent? we also saw a break, retest of the support trend line that we did break
so this is what i see right now, um, the market is going down now
so, as i said, don't forget to be on my morning live streams, because the best setups, as i know, is, um, [Music]
you know, you have the overview from london session, and then you just waiting for the market to come to those levels during the day
and your pc will be faster, uh? because the processor is not overload with the stream
so, yeah, panettone, i think it's because if there's a problem, or it is a problem with the charger, because when i take the charger out, it's, it's fine
and i can swear to god when i say that i'm so bad at when it comes to computers
i'm definitely not as good with computers or other, you know, electronical things
so i'm not gonna lie when i say that most of the time during my life, if i've touched certain um, my family, when i was younger, they actually didn't allow me to, like, touch the computers or nothing, because every time i touched something, i destroyed it
i don't even know how it happened, but they told me, you're not allowed to do anything
so if i come to my my parents place, my dad tells me that i am but i am not allowed to drive these cars because i destroy things
you are 100, right? take fibonacci from 1357 back down to 5, 12 111
i don't know what's going what's wrong with um, with um, youtube, actually
but if you are, if you want to be part of my community, you because i send the i send the links
there you have the you have the link to the community pinned in the chat
so that's the we can also come back down all the way to, uh, 0940
she only knows to turn off and on the computer, but once you start turn it on, she rocks the market
also, shall we have an update on bitcoin? so we did look at dodge coin this morning too
so from this higher time frames fibonacci that we didn't have, i did have it a little bit differently
but take profit, we can come back down to zero, point five thousand, nine hundred and ninety two
we just might also see another drop back down to five thousand six hundred and eighty, potentially five thousand four hundred and eight
marquee came up exactly to the fibonacci levels that i spoke about
can you see? can you see? like, can i zoom in even more? it is beautiful
take profit one, gut hits on xrp, whatever trade you're inside right now
i'm no financial advisor, but if we would see a push to the upside, take profit one on the on most of the pairs got hit
i do have a pretty, i do have my take profit at 17 040 on bitcoin on ethereum, i have it at 930 right now
so whatever market will do now, we can obviously come back up, give us another high, lower high, and then see the continuation of the drop
um, whatever trade i am inside right now, because we're pretty far away from the entry that we took from 1108
in case you would see the market have some momentum to the upside
guys, don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already done that
uh, tomorrow i will have a morning live session, one hour before a london session
you can also look at my crypto trading for beginners right here
part two is the one that i do recommend in the beginning, if you're not already kind of know how that works
but i need to give you some updates, which, uh, videos too, because some people don't like to look at the live streams
don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bit right now, up to four thousand four hundred and fifty dollars
the bonus has changed of up to four thousand four hundred and fifty dollars
this is how you supported me and bitcoin senses by doing that
if you want to be part of the community that we do have for me on bitcoin census, you can go into the live, live chat we have it pinned right there
you can be more in contact with me and with all of the other great, great people
we talk about cryptos and trading overall, and we we just, no, natalie, do you and andy shared the same tg? uh, no, we have two
so andy does have his own telegram group, and i have my own telegram group, but we are in the same company
but for the ones that follows me, is easier to for me to have my community and his to, uh, on his community
but you are more than welcome to be on both communities, obviously
guys, i'm gonna go now, because the market will just, con hopefully continue to drop from here
don't forget to go and just no, practice the charts, because that's how you become good
ask anyone that's good, professional at something, trust me when they say that, then they've been practicing a lot
if you like this live stream, guys, please type one, one, one in the chat
every time i see one, one, one, i stop, i close my eyes, or something like that, depends on where i am, and i just think about all the things that i want in my life

we have like the best opportunity to create whatever we want in life
how are you? okay, how are ya? just one second i'm just gonna give everyone the content, but you already know this
and we're gonna go into the charts, because we just might have, which is what it have, another job or another push, who knows
if you haven't already liked the live stream, i will remind you to do that so you can help me with the algorithm so we can reach out to more people
i hope everyone had a great morning, or a great night, or wherever you are
kim makai, how are you? judith? nadia rush, hello, i love you too
now, the market is actually pretty interesting, i would say myself
how are you? we're just gonna wait for some people to jump into the live stream
they two hours ago, six o'clock in swedish morning, they were outside screaming
how are you guys? if you haven't already like the livestream, please go inside and do that
uh, we're gonna go to forex factory right away, looking at the calendar and see what can happen today
because we know, since before, we were looking at this a couple of days ago
hello, michael and manny, how are you? uh, we were looking at, um, yeah, we do have today again
but today at 4 pm, hopefully we just might, can go into, hopefully we can go into the live stream, uh, the same way we did yesterday
because yesterday we actually went into where we're looking at when the news, uh, came out, or when they spoke
i closed both of the positions because i saw that the market, i'm gonna show you, uh
we saw the market, no where was it? i saw the market at twenty thousand seven hundred and sixty
and at first i had a sell limit order around 200 to 20 864 65 on bitcoin
but i saw that the market was supposed to drop, so i just took away my sell limit orders, and, um, then i just, yeah, i went into market execution
but first of all, i want to look at dxy and see how the dollar index is looking
and it actually looks like, because we can't, okay, this did happen yesterday? oh, yeah
so the only thing that i don't like is this week on the, on the sick 12 hourly chart
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna try to break, okay, okay
so when we go, what i do is that i go in, okay, so what looking at the xy
so what i did was that a couple of days ago, okay, so we came back down, retested the fibonacci again at 103813
and we are about, it looks like we can actually break the the support, the resistance, trend line
and if we do that, this just might be where the market starts to pull back to the upside
and if dxy um is, because the overall on dollar is the it's obviously any option
and what we're looking right here is the downtrend, but this is the pullback
so if the pullback starts to, you know, if the pullback is done right now
um, the market will obviously push to the upside, right? and the impulsive move will start
i'm gonna use this little support right here, because we're holding ourselves above it
and we came back down to the higher low, if we take it from the 104106
okay, uh, so, yeah, this is the, this could actually be where we see the market starts to pull back to the upside, right? and if we then go back, if we go to, uh, bitcoin, do you know dr sees? no, i don't, i don't know that
and technically this is the, i mean, we are, we did create the lower low
now, if we're looking at the four hourly, because the higher time frames is always the, you know, the best one to follow when it comes to market structure
um, so, if we, if we would have another pushback, we already retested the 50 on on this fibonacci one time go down to the lower time frames based on the lower low, lower high
and if we drag the, uh, if we drag a trend line from uh, from the high, connected, uh, lower, lower high, lower high
and right now we can see that the market is inside the fibonacci level, uh, from the one hourly chart, and that is between twenty thousand three hundred and seventy and twenty thousand two hundred and seventy
twenty thousand three hundred and seventy and twenty thousand two hundred and seventy
and, no, i want to actually take it, um, i want to take this on the one hourly chart, just if, yeah, we just might have another cell opportunity at the moment right now, or not, mites
so if i would go into a selfish, if i would go into a self position right now, just to have that confirmation, i want the market to close below
um, i want the market to close below this resistance trendline, but also the support trendline
because if that is the case, we can have a retest from 20 267 again, and then see the continuation of the drop
um, why i want the market to break below the support trend line is because this is the one representing the pullback up to these fibonacci levels that i was just talking about
but for me to to be in a better confirmation that is actually a valid fibonacci, i want the market to break below and close below it, because that is telling me that
and the previous higher low of this option, the little pullback, is right here around twenty thousand one hundred and sixty
and if that is the case, then that we see the market the next lower high is below 20 360
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna take one alert right here, and crossing down
so it when the market, if the market now decides to break that level, it will give me the better confirmation that we're actually that we will actually continue back down
why i'm a little bit unsure about it is because on the higher time frames, what i spoke about is that technically what we're looking at right here is the higher low on the on the four hourly charts
so we just might see another push back up to potentially twenty thousand six hundred and fifty, i have a and then see the drop
so we just might see the market needs to create a a bigger, higher, lower high
because what i do on the lower time frames, i search for a the entry
but for me to not to get faked out, i know it looks so messy at the moment, but for me to not get faked out to the upside and then see the drop, that's why i need the the confirmation that we need to break below certain levels
and if you want to have the update, this just might happen during this live stream
but if you want to, if you want to be updated about this, i have, uh a, a community natalie, uh, bitcoin census natalie community
um, so you if you want to be updated about about this, i, oh, i wanna, we have a great community where we just talk about trading or overall
and mckay, just also put it in the chat, so you have the the link to my telegram group, and you're more than welcome to be part of that
so, yeah, we're just, i'm just waiting for the market to break below this, uh, this, uh, trend line on bitcoin
so, yeah, the same thing on ethereum, yesterday we saw, or i saw the market
and, uh, but i saw that the market didn't have, the market didn't have the moment, the strength to come up to this level
so, uh, before i went from the live stream, i took away my settlement orders, and i just went into market execution on this candlestick right here
um, and so we are impr or, i'm in profit, but we just need to wait and see how what's gonna happen here too
and the fibonacci level could potentially be, it is the fibonacci levels at one 107, potentially one thousand, one hundred and twenty
we're just going to try to do the same thing that we did have on on bitcoin
uh, this looks a little bit better, uh, when it comes to market structure on ethereum, looks, looks way better
but we're also going to drag another fibonacci from 1110 back down to the low at 1047
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can help me to grow the channel
because this channel is actually really good when it comes to, especially technical analysis

uh, i do these morning live streams every single morning, monday to friday, because the setups in the morning is the best ones, because we have the overview of what's actually happening
um, as you can see, we did have, and we also did have a live stream during the hello toby, how are you? and hello everyone else
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
good thing with uh, bibin is that we can hold our positions for such a good, long time with out the high fees
we have very low fees when it comes to, uh, when it comes to vibrate
uh, so, you know, but focusing more on what's happening on ethereum, i try to connect the dots from the first higher low at first low, higher low
we have the high, lower high, lower high, potentially lower high now
and if this is the lower high, we're gonna sell the market, and hopefully the market will take our take profit
i just wanna see, this will take not so long, but give me a couple of seconds and i'll, i'll be right back with you
so one thing that i do before i go into the charts, or for myself every morning, is i do some meditation
and that is the best thing i would recommend for you to do, because that just makes you be very aware of where you are, energetically, uh, just with yourself
because when it comes to the charts, it's very important for us that we are mentally stable
because the thing that destroys the trading for people is fear
but to understand yourself, you will also understand the charts
because what you do on the charts is only a repre i mean, of obviously what you know
but if you don't feel good, you will not, usually, you will not have some good straights
oh, ralph, i don't know why youtube doesn't do that, because i have, i've heard, actually, a lot of people said that
um, i don't know if if there's anything on the settings that you can change, i don't know
but i, i it's a lot of people that have been, uh, telling me that they youtube is not giving them the notifications
uh, the only thing that i don't like, it's not that i don't like it, but, uh, if we're looking at the i do, i do think about that we are below 1130 key level
um, the thing that we're when we're looking at the two daily chart, um, we do have not on the one hour, one daily chart, um, from the support that you can see right here, between 106, 1065 and 1045
so what, i don't what, i don't what if we have the support and we are close, we just closed exactly where the previous support is from the fake out
so that is why this is called the fake out on the thumbnail that you can see
market comes back down, retested, it can take us back up to a little bit higher targets
but what we also need to think about is that we are below the key level
we also came back down and retested the fibonacci levels right here
see you next time, speaking when nothing happens, you know what i mean
youtube, okay, so i would, i would not be surprised if we see a push, first of all
um, if we would have a pullback right now, because it it doesn't look like the market is breaking down now, based on the fake attack that i also spoke about, we did break this, um, we did break this resistance trend line, and we also created a higher loan
so this just might be where we see the market push back up to potentially 107 and 120, sorry, hundred and 1107 and potentially one thousand, one hundred and twenty and, yeah
so we can already see that we start to have some movements to the upside
even though i'm in some positions, it's just great to see that this just might actually be where we see the market push back up to to these levels
i wait for the market to potentially pull back up to 20, 120, 1040 when it comes to um bitcoin
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so we you can help me to reach out to more people and grow the channel
i'm always live from monday to friday, this time, every single day, monday to friday
and so many people gave me some good feedback that they've learned so much through me
and that's why i'm here to help you, uh, and help myself, because i love to do what i do, and it's great to share that knowledge with, with other people that just might think it's pretty a little bit hard when it comes to the charts
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy but up to four thousand
up to four thousand, four hundred and fifty plus zero maker fee for thirty days
that's the, that's the the bonus that we do have right now on by bits
so yesterday, yesterday we were looking at you as 30, and i highlighted, oh, my god, i love it
so i highlighted the supply zone between thirty thousand seven hundred and twenty four and thirty thousand eight hundred and eighty
can you see how perfect the market just came and retested that level
what i did, i took another supply candle from between thirty thousand five hundred and fifty two, uh? to thirty thousand six hundred and twenty market try to break this level close below
what do we do? we take the fibonacci from low, from high to it's beautiful
so you go out from our trade for sale? no, i'm still in the positions
just because the take profit doesn't get hit right away, that doesn't mean that we're gonna, i'm gonna take it out
what do you think? people who, uh, who does uh, swing training? they wait for it
so i changed my, my fibonacci settings from twenty thousand three hundred and six, uh, twenty one thousand three hundred and sixty two, uh, to one nineteen thousand and sixty
that is at the and sorry, at twenty thousand eight hundred and thirty, that was the wrong alert
so this is where i could potentially see bitcoin come to and retest for a potential lower high, no crossing up
so that is why it's really, it's, it's always better to use the fibonacci on the especially for hourly charts
can you see what i speak about when i when i say that, okay, we did have the option
so if these fibonacci, of fibonacci is valid, 19 664 is take profit one
and take profit three is eighteen thousand two hundred and eighty eight
and on ethereum, we are reaching fibonacci level at one thousand eight
if you haven't already like the live stream, guys, we're almost 200 people
but if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, i do have some very good videos where you can learn how to look at the charts the same way that i do
market structure, part one, part two, um, i have back testing sessions where i just go through the market and show you exactly what i see
and so this is, you know, you have to practice it if you want to become good at it
and if especially, um, if you're an investor, or, you just have, you know, people hype and be like, yeah, you should buy bitcoin, blah, blah, blah, where bitcoin doesn't work
it's, i mean, we just need to look at the charts and see what the markets because the market is always telling us what's happening, always, and it will always do that
if it goes back to zero, who knows if if people would know, if people know that everything is just speculations
okay, so what i do right now on matic, we're looking at magic
um, the fibonacci levels where a potential lower high can be created is around 0544 and 0593
that is, also combined with this previous lower low, also a support
so this just might turn into a resistance market drops, we also have the support, uh, the resistance trend line that we just might come back up to
um, but now we're looking at the daily so it's pretty far away
um, we will also do this in case we are right now inside fibonacci level zero point four hundred and ninety and zero point five hundred and thirty
this could also be where we slowly, if we see the market starts to consolidate in between these levels, this could potentially be where the market is, um, breaking to the downside
but on the lower time frames, we can see the break of structure, uh, when the if the market would consolidate in between these levels
he just said, every technically to to make everything simple when it comes to trading
that will create fear, because when you're in drawdown, you will start to do stupid things because you've already done the stupidest thing is that you're going to the charts without even knowing why you're going into the charts
so the only thing stopping us from being profitable traders is fair because if you take a trade based on risk management, you will not be scared, because you know that you will not lose your whole account
i know no one asked about xt satan, but if you're looking at xt sata potential, lower high can be at one point four hundred and thirty four, or one point four hundred and fifty four
okay? so we are coming back up to this fibonacci level at the moment
but i will not change it, because i do believe that we can have the market um pull back down from these levels
because when we're looking at the higher time frames, this is why it's so good for us to use the higher time frames, fibonacci levels, instead of the 15 minute chart, because the the higher time frames is always most respected
and even if the market doesn't do that, well, then we just change our mindset
well, this looks a little bit different than bitcoin does look like
so on on us 30, we just might see the market pull back up to thirty thousand five hundred and twenty three, or potentially thirty thousand five hundred and fifty six
take profit one on these people, not you, on us 30, i'm no financial advisor, but take profit one
thirty thousand three hundred, take profit to thirty thousand one hundred and fifty three
okay, we're looking at sil we're gonna take away everything and just start over
okay, so, uh, if we would see that a sale is breaking below the fifty percent, either four thousand one hundred and ten or four thousand and fifty, if i would see the market break below this level, and we start to see the market giving us a lower high and retest it from below, that for me, is a sell position
but right now the market is creating, the market is just retesting this previous high at the moment
so this could be a fake out to the upside from the fibonacci levels, then retest, and then see the drop
so i wouldn't do anything at the moment on sale, until because even if, i mean, the mark, even if you the market pulls back up, there's no good buy position, because i don't know exactly how far it is
because we came back up and retested another fibonacci level at 4 340, market came back down again
um, but we are, we try to retest the fifty percent at, uh, sixty one point eight percent at four thousand one hundred and ten
that for me, is a self position around these levels right here
i just, i just said exactly what that was, the type of levels
so yesterday on solana, yeah, we are inside the fibonacci level one more time on solana
if i would want uh, instead of just selling the market right now, i would wait for the market to break below this previous uh, break below the 50 percent at 3592, see the market giving me the lower low and then potentially the lower high against 3594
and that's the drop for me, because we just might have the bigger push right now to the upside
but we are inside the fibonacci level at the four hourly chart, but we do have a pretty huge candlestick right now
but what we also can see is that we are retesting this previous resistance
what happens that we had another high high, but the market never had the power to create the higher low and then see the continuation
so we broke below the previous resistance, right now retesting it
and that is also a head and shoulder, which means that from here we can see the drop
where do you take i just, i just told you that we just might go down from here
i know that i can sound like that sometimes, but i'm not looking at dodge coin
okay, so we just might now pull back up to six thousand four hundred and six thousand five hundred dollars, or six thousand five hundred and eighty five dollars, for the market to retest
take profit one, five thousand nine hundred and eight to eight
because look at, looking at the overall picture, the market is going down
if we would see the market have a bigger push to the upside, we can also pull back up and reach 6700, potentially six, 7108
i want to see how it looks on bitcoin ethereum, we're retesting the 50
yes, you're right, but i can be like that in my personal life too
who are you? r r n g, r usdt, guys, we have so many great people on this live stream
please, if you are new to my channel, if this is the first time you're looking at this with me, please write one, one, one in the chat

mr ripples, you've been here for so many you're not new to this channel
juan cantero, guys, why are you lying to me? i know ada watching you every day
i know that some of you that is not here for the first time, but welcome to my channel
i've been doing trading since 2018, where i got introduced to it
then i've been, i got introduced to trading at 2018, and since then, you know, trading in me has been like this
remember that bitcoin senses, we also do have other social media platforms
we have a website, bitcoinsensescom, where we share updates about cryptocurrencies every single day
many of you already know who is, but he also go through daily updates
but we do have so many other people behind bitcoin senses that do, you know, behind the scenes that works every single day
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars, four thousand four hundred and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so when it looks to ethereum, i mean, either we see the market, because we did retest the fibonacci level 1106, we could potentially see the market continue to drop
right now, from this level, if we would see the market drop and we break below, um, 1090, the market pulls back up
so i'm not gonna tell you what to do, but expect the market to reverse back down from these levels
we can pull back up to twenty thousand six hundred and fifty four, or potentially twenty thousand eight hundred and thirty
the thing that i look for when it comes to the higher time frames, if we're looking at two daily charts, if i just take away everything so it makes more sense, we are below 21 040 and and on the five daily chart, we have this huge candlestick that we need, the market potentially needs to fill fell
why do you sound like that sometimes? this is the amazing thing
so what i do is that i that i, i take the close of the five daily candlestick
and that's, i'm gonna be honest, that's how i became so good at reading candlestick, because i just tried to divide how, i don't know how you say that, but i just, i just read the candlestick
and we are right now retesting the clothes of the five daily candlestick
can you see how perfectly the market is retesting this level? we wouldn't even know the market is retesting this level if we don't look at the five daily charts
we don't understand that you're retesting the close of the previous five daily, right? okay, so we're looking at the five daily, and that is okay
so 20 and 530 go down to the lower time frames we're retesting it at
but as i said, we just, i would definitely see the market pull back up to these levels
but then if we see the break to the downside, and we close below twenty thousand, twenty thousand three hundred, what was it? twenty thousand five hundred and thirty, and we retest from below, guys, that is definitely a sign that we will continue back down
guys, we, we just might need to pull back down and fill this huge, crazy wick that we do have
this is why we should always practice the charts, because you just become smarter and smarter each time
and we, and if we drag the fibonacci from twenty thousand eight hundred and sixty four and on the two daily, we're gonna have it at one thousand nineteen nine 963
but for an extra confirmation, so we don't get faked out, because that can definitely happen too
break below 20 423 potential rita's that is, yeah, that could also be the case
so i wouldn't do anything at the moment, because we just might have to pull back to the four hourly fibonacci
but 20 530 is definitely a great level for me to use to see how the market will behave around it
we can go to ethereum on the five daily charts before i go, looks a little bit differently, because that is the kind a key level
so yeah, same thing if we would see the market pull back now, because we did retest the 50 at 1170
so i'm just gonna, i'm just gonna, i'm just gonna let my trades be inside of it, because i already have a great position
okay, guys, i gotta go, just like the case says, because i'm gonna do some charts for tick tock and twitter
and so guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that
hit the notification so you know when i am live, because we will have a live stream today

you're you're the only one who stopped yourself for being successful
because everyone wants to live a happy life, right? don't blame other people on you
my name is josh, and we could be about to see a 20 to 30 move in the bitcoin price and to the ethereum price, if bitcoin simply breaks above this price level, and if ethereum breaks above this price level, and i'll be talking more about that later in the video, so definitely stick around
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and today, as you can see, we are in the green, which has actually helped out crypto prices in the shorter term
dollar chart on the weekly time frame, technically speaking, right now, the price of bitcoin is still trading in this area of maximum opportunity, according to bitcoin's entire price history
in fact, throughout bitcoin's entire price history, looking at the 200 week moving average, which is the red line, we've only ever seen the bitcoin price touched up moving average just three other times throughout bitcoin's entire price history
and apart from right now, we've only ever seen the weekly bitcoin rsi in oversold territories just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history
and we have only ever seen the price of bitcoin contact the 300 week moving average, which is the blue line, just one other time in bitcoin's entire price history, which was march 2020
so when you're talking about well over a decade of history, obviously this means right now, technically speaking, is a very rare opportunity, according to the last decade of history
once again, but obviously keep in mind, this is on the weekly time frame
each one of these candles is an entire week, so these moves in the bitcoin price take a long time to play out
and in fact, in some cases, like 2015 and the end of the 2018 bear market, we can even stay within these moving averages for multiple months
but if you do zoom into the shorter term, this is what we see right here on the 12hour bitcoin chart
once again, we still have these active bullish divergence in play, and that bullish cross we saw a few days ago in the 12hour bitcoin macd
and as i've been saying pretty much every single day over the past four to five days, this just means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum for bitcoin
so basically shortterm relief in this larger downtrend that we're currently in
and obviously, we saw very similar patterns, talking about this bullish divergence and the bullets cross in the macd around a month ago, and the outcome from that was simply more sideways consolidation
and now it's worth giving you an update on that head and shoulders pattern that i covered in yesterday's video on the one hour bitcoin charts
and obviously, as you can see right here, we never confirmed a break below the neckline, which was sitting at around 198 k, as i mentioned in my last video
and in case there's any beginners watching this video, a head and shoulders pattern is typically a bearish pattern
if we confirm a break below the neckline, which obviously we did not see just here
and the opposite to a head and shoulders pattern is, of course, an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish pattern
but once again, we need to confirm a break above the neckline in order to confirm an upside price target
and if you zoom out to the four hour bitcoin charts, we do actually have an inverse heterotrollers pattern forming right now
but once again, keep in mind, this is in its formation phase at the time of recording this video
and we still need to see a confirmed break above the neckline, which is sitting at around 211 k to 212 k
but ideally, if we could see the price of bitcoin at break above this previous high and actually set up higher highs, then that would be even better for the shortterm trend for bitcoin
so those are the levels of resistance that i am paying attention to in the shorter term for bitcoin to potentially help confirm a further breakout to the upside
but to keep in mind, this is only on the fourhour chart, not the weekly chart, for example, so we're only talking about somewhat smaller moves
but if we do end up seeing a confirmed breakout above the neckline that i just mentioned, then the technical price target would be sitting at around 26 000 approximately
so from the point of the breakout to that technical price target, that is a potential 24 move in the price of bitcoin, which is obviously something we could make profits off if it does play out
but once again, i want to make it clear that this is the technical price target if we confirm a break above the neckline
if we do not see a breakup off this neckline, then this price target at around 26 000 never comes into play
and as for confirmation, i'll be looking for at least a four hour candle close, but ideally a couple for our candle closes above the neckline
and to see even more confirmation, we could wait for a retest
but keep in mind, a retest doesn't happen with every breakouts
but if the price of bitcoin does end up initiating a breakout above the neckline and then pulling back down towards the neckline, it is important for the price to hold above that neckline and basically bounce from that level, confirming a retest
because otherwise, if we see a slight breakout and then come back down below the neckline, then that would invalidate the price target
and now this is not financial advice, but personally, when i'm talking about my own strategy, how i usually trade an inverse header shortest pattern is by simply setting up an entry into a long position above the neckline
so once again, we need to confirm a breakout above the neckline
and personally, i always set up a stop loss below the neckline in case we see a slight breakout and then actually invalidate the breakouts
and so in the worst case scenario where we could see a slight breakout and then come back down, i'll simply take a slight loss on that trade, but avoid liquidation, because once again, i get stopped out of the trade
but if things go to plan and we see a successful breakout to the upside, what i personally always aim to do with my own trades is, once the trade enters a decent amount of profits, i always aim to move my stoploss towards my entry price, or ideally into profits, so that if we see a reversal before the price target, i'd get stopped out at a break even
or when the trade is in profits, if, of course, i've placed the stop loss in profits
so that's just some insight into my personal trading strategy when it comes to inverse head and shoulders patterns
but once again, i want to make it clear that that is not financial advice for you
of course, you can decide whatever you want to do with your own money
and now getting into the ethereum part of this video, right here on the weekly ethereum charts, we still have this 382 fibonacci level coming into play at around a thousand dollars, more specifically, at around 1050
so that is, of course, one of the main levels of support that i am still paying attention to for ethereum
and obviously, nothing much has happened over the past few days
obviously we're still playing out more choppy, sideways price action, as expected, based on this bullish divergence and the bullish cross in the 12 hour ethereum macd similar to what we saw around a month ago
so of course, this is also very similar to the bitcoin 12 hour chart as well
and another similarity between ethereum and bitcoin is on the four hour ethereum to your solar chart, because we're seeing the same inverse, header, shortest pattern as what we're seeing on the four hour bitcoin charts
but of course, with the ethereum chart, we have slightly different prices and price targets to pay attention to
so for example, looking at the neckline for this head and shoulders pattern that we must break above in order to actually validate this pattern that is coming in at around 1160
but ideally, i would like to see a break above this previous height, so that we actually set in a new higher high for the shortterm trend
and that previous high is coming into play at around 12 k, approximately
and once again, i'll be looking for other confirmations, such as four hour candle closes and a possible retest if we do start turning around after a breakout
and if we do end up seeing a confirmed break above that neckline that i just mentioned, then the technical price target for this inverse head and shoulders pattern for ethereum is currently coming into play at around one and a half thousand
so from the point of the breakout to that technical price target, that would be around a 30 move for ethereum, if we see a confirmed breakout, above that neckline
and obviously, when it comes to my personal trading strategy for ethereum, i'll use the same strategy as what i just mentioned for bitcoin when it comes to this inverse head and shoulders pattern
but once again, that's just letting you know what i do with my own money, not telling you what you should do with your own money, because i cannot do that, because i'm not a financial advisor
and speaking of trading bitcoin and ethereum, the biggest trading competition in the entire world is happening in just three and a half days from now
so if you want to be a part of this, which, by the way, only happens just one time per year, then feel free to check it out in the first link down below, in the description and in the pinned comments, which would take you to this page right here, where you can actually join my crypto world team, if you want to

i really hope you enjoyed it, and i'll see you all in the next video
all right, everyone, welcome back to the channel for another quick update on the bitcoin unchained metrics
today we're going to be momentarily talking about the bitcoin realized price
now this is a great metric to understand when the average investor, uh or specifically, when the average buyin of the bitcoin price, is under the water
let's explain realized price quickly, and then we will jump into the chart
bitcoin's realized price is the value of all bitcoins at the price they were bought, divided by the number of bitcoins in circulation
uh? that is the key word here, the average cost basis at which bitcoins were purchased, which is another way of describing the realized price
so unlike the market cap, which tells us the price of bitcoin right now, the realized price simply tells us the average purchase price of all bitcoins in circulation
so, as you can imagine, when the realized price is above the bitcoin price, and we can see this over in this chart here, we've got a key down here
the blue line slash black line, is the btc price on a logarithmic growth curve scale, and this orange line is the realized price
so you can see, you know, in this market structure over here, we spent four months beneath the realized price, meaning that the average price that people bought bitcoin for was underwater
so let's say, hypothetically, you know, most people bought bitcoin for, you know, ten to twenty dollars, and the realized price was sitting about five to six dollars, at that range, meaning that most people were underwater when the price action moved below the realized price
this was one of our longer market structures where we actually spent the good part of nine months
and i say, i say nine months because, you know, this says it was from january to october, but we really didn't get out until pretty much the exact end of october
so, you know, this, this was basically a nine month structure where we were stuck beneath the realized price, moving over into the bear market of 2018, from november to the start of april
and bear in mind, this was basically the end of november coming into the start of december
so as you can tell, you know, within these charts, sometimes we spend a few months, sometimes we spend nine months, you know, sometimes we spend four months within the pandemic drop
march the 12th is when we capitulated below the realized price, and we were out by march the 19th
so why do we look at this metric, well, it's fairly obvious to say that bitcoin has been on a massive parabolic growth since its inception, back around 2009 to 2010, when it started trading
now it is very rare to find that the majority of bitcoin traders are under the water
because, like we said, with the realized price, this gives us the average cost basis at which bitcoins were purchased
and as the buying power of bitcoin keeps on increasing, and i say the buying power because, in my opinion, bitcoin is a currency
it's also the greatest asset in mankind, uh? so, you know, there's a lot of things that you could call bitcoin, but for the sake of this, let's just say it's a currency
so as you can tell, over time, the buying power of bitcoin is exponentially increasing when we are pricing against the us
so why is this important? as you can tell, the average cost basis is the average price that most people buy bitcoin at
and if we do, you know, the most we spent is about nine months if we add up the average of all of our drops so far
so we're not going to take this one into consideration because we've route we're basically rounding them up or down
so we've got the nine month here, then we've got a four month
so if we add another one to that, you can see we we've spent, in total, approximately 18 months below the realized price
now, why is this important to know? well, we've done this once, twice and three times, potentially even four times
if you want to divide it by four to encompass this data point, you definitely can
i would say that it would be worth including that data point, as we are talking about capitulations with a realized price
and if we're talking about on average, then we should definitely include this data point
with that being said, if we divide the summation of all the time that we spent beneath the realized price, if we divide that by, uh, the amount of, or the the number of times that we have capitulated below the realized price, which is four times so far, then you will see, on average, we spend 45 months beneath the realized price
which gives us a fairly good indicator and a fairly good signal that if, on average, we are going to continue what we've been doing in terms of the bitcoin realized price, which is predominantly, you know, 80 to 90 percent of the time staying above the realized price, then we should expect that if on average, this is going to play out as it has previously done, we should not be spending more than nine months beneath this market structure
we should be spending at the very least a week below this market structure
but taking into the averages, we should be, uh, beneath here for about four to five months
considering we capitulated below this in june, this would be spelling that we could be having a reversal above the realized price by the end of the year
so once again, the realized price is a great way of understanding what the average cost basis of bitcoin is
it tells us, at this moment in time that the average cost basis is sitting at 22 500
and historically, if you buy when bitcoin is beneath the realized price, you almost always have the highest gains to trade
now, you know, on my channel, i like to look at as many onchain metrics, social metrics, charts, uh, market structures, moving averages and everything i can from previous structures to try and nail as close to the bottom as we can
this chart is saying, you know, while we might not be at the bottom yet, while it might take another couple of months to get to that bottom, it is, on average, probably a great place to stack up on bitcoin for the long term
so, uh, if you are new to my channel, first of all, warm welcome
the seasoned veterans of my channel who do watch have known that i have been buying bitcoin down from 25 000
i've been sitting on the sidelines for months now, and i've been saying, i'm buying bitcoin in 1 000 increments from 25 000
considering the bitcoin price capitulated almost down to 17k, that means i bought at 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19 and 18, and i am going to continue buying in 1 000 increments down to 14 000
so, uh, the reason why i'm talking about fourteen thousand is because this is where our elliott wave structure would be
i'm really just gonna draw it very quickly, because i don't wanna make this a ta video
but nonetheless, if you are new to the channel, i'll show you why, coming up to 14 000, this was our one wave, uh, in terms of the macro impulse waves
now, i'm really not going to draw, uh, all of the microwaves within them
if you do want, uh, you know, the microwaves and all of that, then check out my bitcoin elliott wave videos
but, you know, historically, and always, if elliott wave theory is going to play out, we bottom between the one and the three wave, as we're already down here, this should mean that, in my opinion, this green box down here, between 14 000 and 20 000, should mark the bottom for bitcoin
this is agreed upon when we look at the bitcoin realized price
so i am going to be doing, uh, my best to dca as much bitcoin as i can down at these levels
but bear in mind, i do think we probably do have one last final capitulation, just like we did when we broke below the realized price here, we back test it, had one last capitulation
what do we do here? we broke down almost back tested it one last capitulation
but you can see we actually back tested it a couple of days later, and then made the final capitulation
so a lot of signs point to the fact that we've broken down, we've pulled up the back test, and i think we're getting ready for the final capitulation on the btc usd press, that's all i've got today for the realized press
all right, everyone, welcome back to the channel for another update on bitcrane
in today's video, i want to talk about a few different things
has it been changed, or is it unchanged? and i want to talk about an interesting fractal that i see playing out on the daily time frame
we're going to be talking about, once again, one of the most important levels we would need to see to see a trend reversal
and we're going to finish off talking briefly about the greater market
so i'm going to make this video relatively quick compared to my other videos
uh? because simply, yesterday we made the video bitcoin, the lower height
this was a 33 minute video where we went through a plethora of charts, and we talked about bitcoin, bitcoin against the spy, bitcoin against the m2 money supply of the moving averages, macro moving averages, lower time frames, market structure, all of that good stuff
so let's dive into this video, and we'll make this one pretty quick
so what i want to talk about to start with is the market structure
has it been changed, or is it unchanged? well, let's look at the four hourly time frame, and let's decipher what has been going on in this, quoteunquote, threeday bull market that we're currently witnessing over on bitcoin
so you can see, since the 9th of june, we've basically fallen off the table from 30 000, massive, massive capitulation down to these lower levels
now, i want to start off by highlighting this level here on the 16th of june
and why this is important is because this was a big run back up to the upside
and this was where we solidified another lower high in the market structure
and why this is interesting is because the bullish price tag that everyone got out of bed for on the 16th of june was bitcoin pumping back up to 23 000
but if you look back seven days ago, you know, we were at 30 000
and if only a week ago you said that we're gonna move down to 23 000, that would have been considered fud
so it's very interesting how last week's fud has turned into this week's bullish price tag
i just did find, uh, that fairly interesting, judging by, uh, you know, social metrics and market sentiment
and as you can see we're just littering, uh, the chart with these lower lows and lower highs throughout all the time frames
and bearing right? i mean, we can zoom out and do this forever, going through this entire chart, uh, but i just want to talk about these lower time frames
but what have we done today in the past 12 hours? really specifically, we've had a fairly decent run up, and we are running up
and once again, this is interesting because the previous lower high was at twenty one thousand seven hundred
so at least in the four hourly time frame, you really can't get two out of bed until we take out twenty one thousand seven hundred
and then even if we do, there is a lot of other very interesting levels that would be very, very hard for us to move up to
so question number one, has the market structure changed? uh, no, the market structure is completely unchanged
uh, from two days ago, where we did make this video, bitcoin, the lower high, i think this is gonna, this is gonna say two days, probably by the time i upload this video, because this was probably like a day and 22 hours ago or something
i really don't like using trend lines, just because i feel like you can draw them a million and one different ways, and then it happens all the time when you break above them, and then you just slide blow them like that
i'm really interested in the market structure, mainly being lower lows and lower highs right now
so has the market structure changed? no, we are still in a lower high formation
and this really kind of does seem like a rounding top, in my opinion
now, this did look like a, uh, like a head and shoulders earlier
and when i made a, when i made an ethereum video about an hour or two ago, i was talking about this head and shoulders
but it does seem like we are, i don't want to say invalidating it, because you really can just draw something like this and it would still be valid
it looks like it wants to move a little bit further up to the upside
and i wouldn't be surprised necessarily, if we do take another leg up, for example, i don't actually think we'd be able to take out, uh, the top of the fourhour ema ribbons
and if we do, i imagine it would be within the next four to eight hours
and subsequently, i do not think the 21 600 would be taken out
and then, once again, you could just draw out a greater head and shoulders, because this could have been drawn multiple ways before we had, you know, accurate information on what was going on
for example, you can see left shoulder, head, and then this would have been the right shoulder
but this is where we would have wanted to come down and break down
so then you could have said, okay, you know, this is just one greater left shoulder
and then you could have said, as well, you know, this is the right shoulder
so i honestly think this head and shoulders, uh, is is very, very valid
and if we get back the original head and shoulders, that we see panning out
bear in mind, you know, if i move this over, we did have basically a mini head and shoulders, a mini fake out of a mini head and shoulders, uh, over on here
you know, you can see this almost, almost came into fruition, and then, boom, we just came back up to the upside
so at this moment in time, this head and shoulders would definitely be something i'd be keeping my eyes on
21 350 really does seem like, uh, at least a shortterm price to beat
but then again, you have the 13 ema, and this is going to provide a super, super high level of resistance
and why is the 13 ema going to provide such a high level of resistance? because the 13 ema is such a good indicator at letting you know, what is the market structure doing
this is one of my favorite short term indicators, because you can see, we flip blue at 46 000
you broke down, you tried to flip it, you came back for the back test
once again, had another failed move, and this turned into a double fake out, a double top an m pattern
subsequently, we massively, massively broke back to the downside
and now for the past, for the past couple of days, we've really been seeing another type of a crab market, where we've more or less just been capitulating sideways
and even though, you know, we have been making at least higher lows since the 18th of june, so bear in mind, you know, this has been a five day, uh, bull market
you enjoying the three or four day bull market? because as far as i can tell, this is just another dead cat balance now, uh, market structure is relatively flat
or should i say, the the um, the squeeze, momentum indicator is relatively flat on the four hourly time frame, uh
on the daily time frame, is starting to subside, as we do have this bounce
uh, which really does tell me that the macro bearish structure is very, very much in play
and i do think we would be getting ready for that big, big move back down to the downside
this is the head and shoulders, but i don't know if it's trying to tell me the price tag is all the way down here
i don't know what it's doing, uh, but nonetheless, this is what i see panning out
now, there's one other thing i want to talk about, and it is a interesting, fractal and one last price target, uh, that you would really need to keep in mind, because this would be another one that i do not think we'd be able to break above
now, in the past couple of months or so, we've had a few fomc meetings
and what was interesting about this is, even when we had our bouncers back up
uh, we never managed to break back above the fomc meeting high
so this happened on it, i believe it was the the 15th of june
for some reason, even though we get bearish news, we still pump into the uh, we still pump on the day of the meeting rather uh, what are we doing? we pumped up
and this is kind of where we started to expect a big, big leg to the downside
but what did we do before initially taking that big leg to the downside? well, we capitulated
and we were making this market structure where in the macro time frames, you were making these low lows, lower lows, lower lows
and then on the daily all of a sudden you had one big move back up to 22 800
now, if we mark this by a horizontal ray and see what happened on the four hourly time frame, what can you see? you can see this was the lower low that we were talking about on this market structure
so you've got a, you've got a high low or high low, high, low, high
and this is still what is playing out in the macro time frame, but what is happening on the daily right now? so as just like we were here, we were capitulating, going crab market
and in the macro time frame, you can see, you know, we were still making these lower lows and lower highs within the market structures
and then out of nowhere, you saw a big, big pump up into the next day, and you temporarily actually pushed above the previous daily candle body
we looked at this on the four hourly timeframe, and you can see this was where we got rejected from the four hourly ema ribbons, and subsequently we started moving back down to the downside
what are we doing right now? well, just like we were crabbing here, we are crabbing right now
we have been making this market structure where in the higher time frames, on the daily, we've been making these lower lows and lower highs
and at this moment in time, a little bit of momentum has kicked in
uh, some of the degenerates are out there, you know, heavily, heavily buying a dip right now
but nonetheless, we have had a slight move back above this candle here
now, if we do not get any continuation coming in the markets, i definitely think this is going to be something where we have, you know, that kind of double double top where we take a, it's almost like an ex an expanded flat double top
you know, normally you have these expanded, uh, flat bottoms where you've got a bottom, you kind of chop sideways for a bit, and then you have an expanded flat bottom, then go to the upside
this is basically almost what we're seeing, uh, but on the inverse
so you can see, you know, you have this big run up, you have this crowd market
you take that next leg to the upside, and this almost looks like the chart of bitcoin's alltime high
and we are not really getting supported by volume at this moment in time
sure, in the lower time frames you can see a tiny bit of volume, but we now have a new price to beat, at least at this moment in time
as of the time of recording, you can see we do this time over time, over time, up again
hourly time frame, we do sometimes make higher lows, higher highs, all of that good stuff
but you zoom out, you you really look at the big macro moves, specifically the ones that take you back into the four hourly emas
you have the move into the four hourly emas at 21 700, and now we are having a move back into the ema ribbons at 21 000
you would still need to take the lid off of the previous high up here, which is at 21 700
and even if you did that on the daily time frame, i think it's very important to recognize that unless you take the top off of the fomc meeting high roundabout you know, you can say, this is 22 700 on the fomc meeting
or you can draw this up to here at basically 23 000, which, once again, was this macro top up here
then i don't think the market structure would have changed whatsoever
so wrapping up this video, i also do want to show you, uh, this basically, once again, this expanded flat correction, which is, once again, where you have this bottom, you either crab, where you take a leg up, and then you have an expanded bottom to the downside, and then you start moving up, or doing whatever you're going to do
this is kind of what we're seeing, but to the inverse, you know, as you can see, big run up
you had, uh, an expanded, i don't even know what you'd call this, an expanded, uh, move back to the upside, uh, an expanded top, maybe an expanding double top
you can see, you know, these wicks were only up here for a day
and those two separate daily candles, you did not get continuation
and what subsequently happened? he started rolling back down to the downside because he was still very much in, uh, a bearish market structure
i do think we're getting ready for that next league to the downside
i've been sitting on the sidelines for quite, uh, quite a long period of time now
i have been saying, since 25 000, i've been buying in one thousand dollar increments, and i do plan on buying all the way down to 14k, even though i don't think 14k is coming
so that means i did buy it 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, all the way down to 18 000, because we came down to 17 600
i would also like to just spend one minute talking about the greater markets while we do wrap up this video
bitcoin, in my opinion, the reason why we are seeing a bounce right now, besides the fact that the stock market had a baby bounce, is that we are basically back testing the previous alltime high
we all knew this would be a massive, massive level of support
that's where i think the bottom will be in and then i think we can start moving back to the upside
looking at the total, we're holding the 200 week, and i think we're going to move down to the 300 week, representing a 250 billion drop
altcoin market cap, the exact same sitting on the 200, coming down to the 300 would be a 186 billion drop, or a 37 drop approximately the dxy, the us
my personal price target right now is for the dollar to come up to the 1618 fib up to 111, and then i think that's where we're going to top
and when we're going to start breaking down while the dollar is up here, or should i say, when the dollar is moving up to 111
this is when i expect the spy to take its final leg to the downside
and this would carry us all the way down to the 200 week moving average
uh, is slightly lower than the price right now on the spy, which is never really a good thing
uh, but to answer very briefly on the on what we talked about the start of the video, has the market structure changed? no
we are very much putting in this lower low, lower high formation
if you did want to be more macro bullish, then you'd need to take out the top of the daily push up here
and you would also need to take off the roof of the fomc meeting, which, once again, is the same price at 23 000
uh, until that happens, and even if that does happen, i do not think that we are in the clear
i do think the next leg to the downside is coming very, very soon
so the current bitcoin price is twenty thousand four hundred and ninety eight dollars
and what i've done is i have bitcoin over here on a oneday chart
i thought, let's start off with a little bit of a zoomed out perspective
so congratulations to all of you who managed to participate in that
so what do i have over here? essentially what i wanted to show you is this trend line that's been governing the lower highs throughout you can see that price is, of course, getting quite far extended away from that
and at some point i am still expecting a snap back towards that trend line, which is when then i would look to short and lay off any sort of spot positions
i'm not holding any spot but for those of you who are caught up in longterm spot positions and you've been waiting to get out whenever that snapback or mean reversion trade takes place, back up to these regions, which is coming about 26 27 000
and bear in mind that level will decrease over time, i would look to then lay off those positions
so what i'm having a look at over here is essentially this, uh, consolidation phase
so i did mention on previous shows that when you have a consolidation like that, it's usually met with a big sell off afterwards
so it is that means there's going to be expansion, and it typically happens in the direction, uh, of the trend, which is currently down
so what i'm watching now, and i'm a little bit nervous of this happening, or at least for from the bull case, is that we kind of caught in this range
and if price kind of knocks around in this level over here, then eventually you're going to have probably another and final leg down
but when i zoom in, this is what i'm seeing on the bitcoin price
the best way to trade this right now is most likely going to be as a range trader
bear in mind that risk still does remain to the downside, and that's because you have price below all important moving averages, uh, which for me personally is the 21, the 50 and the 200 ema
they're all you have the short term moving average below the midterm, which is below the long term
so what i've done is i have, i i've taken my chart like this on a four hour and zoom in on a one hour, and i'm kind of waiting to just see what happens at this level in the mid range
so if you start to see price react like this, and i did cover this in today's newsletter, if you start to see, firstly, you already have um this area, which was now your high, you've now made a another low, which has come below there, watch to see if you have a rejection off of the 200 ema
if price starts to come down like this, and mess around over here, and then retest that area as resistance
that would be your signal to activate your next short trade and targeting the range lows, which is coming in at eighteen thousand dollars
so the exact price levels, and the explanation is going to be outlined in today's daily candle newsletter, if you're not subscribed to that, please do subscribe
i'm sure a lot of you are wondering, though, what is going on with the bnb trade? well, this is kind of where we act
so looking at bnb over here, you have, and this is why i said, trying to gain a bigger entry into that underside resistance, because this is the most probable, this is what i said on my tweet thread yesterday as well as in the daily candle newsletter
i said, this is your most probable area of rejection, which is why at this point i'd want to be about 50 answered already into my short trade
and then you leave the last last bit as close as possible to your invalidation
so for those of you who did listen to that advice, you would be in profit
but what's going on now? what's exactly the the picture of this situation over here? well, firstly, you had price come down
you could either lay off some of your profits here, and then readd them in this zone
i think that what's going to happen with the crypto market is that bitcoin will most likely, uh, trade within this range
it will come either to the range lows or break the range lows
you can see, if you look in relation to the previous high over here, we didn't even get close
so i thought, maybe we'll get a little bit higher, get bulls a bit more euphoric, thinking that, look, the bottom's in, and we're going to rally out of here
this uh on, bitcoin is probably going to push up also, a little bit higher, and then we'll deviate back down, retest midrange and go down
and you'd think, with altcoins, what is that going to do? of course, it's going to send many of the altcoins onto new lows
however, it still did work out for the short trade, because this was your load up area within the underside resistance
but when you compare that to the bnb trade, you can see that bnb came much closer to the invalidation level and much deeper into that underside resistance
then also having a look over here at the bitcoin dominance, you can see that, uh, i've kind of drawn out a similar range to what bitcoin is in
you have your range low, your range high, your diagonal trend line
and this is gonna, bear in mind, play out over a couple of months
so what could happen here is you could have some sort of a wick down to about 4281 level, which might be that last and final spike up for the altcoins where the liquidity will be grabbed
i think bitcoin will then continue to push on up towards the range height, towards 48, nearly the 50 level
and then we'll have to see where that's going to break out above this and continue on higher, or reject and continue to play within the range, is another story for later
but as you can see, if i if you look at the time horizon, that's about the end of the ranges at about 25 october
it should tie in with a lot of the things that are going on with the geopolitical events in the world
but essentially, i don't think that altcoins are going to be benefactors
if you are looking to, if you're someone that really wants to accumulate in this level, i'd rather go with accumulating bitcoin
if you have to have exposure in the crypto market, bitcoin is still going to be your best bet
yes, there has been a little bit of a breakdown, but it's nothing too major yet
the way i see it is really, uh, crypto is just kind of still caught within the range
we're going to be range bound until, in my opinion, we're going to be range bound until next week, so the end of june, going into july
and that's when we leave this range, whether it be to the upside or the downside

i did shave off a bit of my profits on my short positions, just expecting a bit of a smaller bounce back up, where i'm going to reload onto those short positions and ride it back down
so that's just what you do when you want to bring your averages down as you take profits along the way
remember the shorts probably only have one more leg down, one more uh, sort of cascade to the downside, and then that's going to be the end of the shorting
i'll then only be mostly looking for either higher lows to buy, higher high lows and higher highs, and finding the next uptrend

in this episode, we're just going through bitcoin here on the weekly
just a quick reminder, how we did close the weekly candle last week, above the oldtime high weekly close here from back in 2017
i'm going to show you how, if this level is lost, i'm going to go through here why that we could have a potential drop to 12 000 in a matter of weeks
and are we going to still continue this massive weekly capitulation? as you can see several weekly candle closes, are we still going to aggressively be falling below 19 000? or are we gonna hold this range in the next coming weeks, something that we are going to talk about in today's episode
and also taking a look at the one hourly chart yesterday, we did talk about this potential shorting opportunity
i did short this, of course, and it looks very, very good here forward
but we're going to talk about today, major levels where we could see some potential opportunities
we have seen the alltime high close on the weekly and also on the daily
the weekly is round about the eighteen thousand nine hundred dollars
and the daily levels are around about nineteen thousand four hundred
we have major daily weekly at this range, below nineteen thousand dollar nineteen thousand dollar area, okay, from the alltime high of 2017
and we have a pretty nice consolidation from december, november, december of 2020
we had that beautiful weekly close above that range, huge, massive drop
so the consolidation is very, very real before any potential continuation
we have been capitulation, capitulating here on the weekly as you can see, very, very aggressively
so maybe a potential stop before continuation to the downside, or even a reversal, is very, very likely after this successful weekly close
now, if we do lose this range in the next coming weeks, okay, in the next coming days or weeks, i do think it might be in weeks if we do have that level lost
okay, the 19 000, i just want to show you here how there is a huge, big gap on the volume profile
we do have some volume profile here, all right, holding the range also
but if we do lose that 19 000 area, we can see that there's a big, big, massive gap here in volume profile
the biggest volume profile that we do have, that the value area high from 2019 and 2020, is right over here at the 12 000 area
as you can see, okay, talking about 2018, actually 2019 and 2020, all of this large consolidation in the bear market
we can see that resistance range in 2019, touching those levels in the summer, and also in the summer of 2020, not managing to break that zone, okay, after a few months when we reached alltime high by the end of 2020
if bitcoin were to break down 19 000 in the coming weeks, we could see the price action going down aggressively to that range
because the price action from 12 000 all the way to twenty thousand was very, very fast, as you can see
just want something that i wanted to point out now, if we start defending this level, just having wicks below nineteen thousand dollars, this could be the bottom, actually

and also, they can support over a hundred thousand transactions per second, so you won't see any overload on your position
now, we're gonna go through the one hourly chart here on bitcoin, most importantly, because most of you want to know here
now, yesterday we did find out this major, big level for that potential rejection
this is why i did short here the 215, and i'm gonna explain reason number one, we were hitting the resistance from this ascending channel
okay, from this trading range that we've had for the last 10 days
as you can see, we did have a nice, big value area high, managing to actually just spike above this range
this is very likely going to be a fake out because of this resistance trend line, and also because we were hitting the 078 fibonacci level, from this high over here to the lows of the drop, as you can see here, hitting that level to perfection
looking for that pullback from this area, hitting the 204 k levels, which was our take profit one area at least
now, what we can see here also right now, this was the reason why we were looking for that major rejection after this big runup
a lot of people, analysts, you know, already been extremely bullish, talking about, the bottom is in, is bitcoin going to go to much higher levels? and we had a pretty nice drop from this exact level that we did talk about, okay, yesterday, of almost eight percent
the other scenario, of course, we need to take a look at the other scenario
but this is why you wanted to have a tight stoploss from this range if you did have a breakout
we were looking at the next level, okay, for a potential shot which was the 227
and it's also being respected here with the price action as support and as resistance, as you can see on the chart
okay, consolidation would probably, uh, indicate that this is a good level
too short, because their price action to the upside is, you know, getting rejected
we did have the good trade here, coming all the way down to this range
now the question is, we've broken from this ascending channel? i think it's very likely that we are potentially going to have continuation to the downside
what is the projected move? well, the projected move is the width of a channel, okay? if you do have an ascending channel and you do break support, okay, ascending channels are usually bearish
this is something that we mentioned yesterday, that you're the probabilities and actually coming down and breaking support or higher
and if you have a descending channel, they are usually bearish
so we should be having here a rejection from the resistance, okay, uh, from the support of this ascending channel and actually continue to the downside
and this could potentially take us round about this level over here, the 19400, 19500 range, plus minus 100 because of the volatility
if we do hit that level next coming hours, okay, a couple of days, we do have that little pump, potentially get that rejection from this major level
can we do this yes, but let's just go with the trend here, the breakout
what i want to explain here is this major, big level, the 194, 195, 196 range, okay, plus minus a few hundred dollars
that is the major level where we're probably going to stop, if we do have that projected move down here
let me just zoom out here, all right, and show you right away
but you can see how many daily candles have been closing round about this range
so we should be getting that reaction from this level, because we have done also as resistance
if we go back to the one hourly chart, this is the daily level that i am talking about
it acted as resistance, as you can see, two times, and then actually broke above, and we managed to stay above this major daily level
so if we come down and consolidate at this level, okay, it is the projected move from the ascending channel
and if we take a look at fibonacci levels from the extreme low to the highs, you know, you would be hitting in between fifty percent and six one
just in case, if you do get that volatility range for the next, you know, hours, coming days
if you do come down there, this is a major level where i would be very much interested in longing
and also, you do can see a potential scenario here, forming an inverse head and shoulder with a descending neckline
we the capitulation is, you know, coming to a kind of an end here
so the possibility and actually forming an inverse head and shoulder with this descending neckline with the lower highs, is very, very high, guys
of course, we will be looking for those major levels and those trading opportunities until we don't see more price action
thank you very much for joining check out bitcoin centre's website down below to find, you know, the latest news and technical analysis ideas
how is everyone doing today? we're going to dive in straight away into the bitcoin price to see what is going on, and check out some different other markets
and today hopefully it's going to be a better day, because yesterday was a little bit of a mess with my internet computer not putting the microphone it was absolutely crazy
how is everyone doing today? let's dive in here, straight into the content
mark dutch, i can see you here already in the comment section
i'm just gonna go quickly through the comment section and we'll go through the charts right away
okay, go through right away on what we were talking about on yesterday's absolutely messy live stream
i was over eight minutes talking without the microphone on, which was absolutely crazy
guys, if you can hear me, i used to do a checkin all the time before, and haven't been doing it lately, and this is what happens
been eight minutes talking with the microphone turned off, which was absolutely crazy
uh, felipe, crypto legends, how are you? omar? guys, what wtf is happening in this market? i know, crazy market, right? um, hello
andy says, half, how are you? um, why is it still luna as cryptocurrency? uh, why is it still yeah, why do i have luna still has cryptocurrency? would you mean here, right in the intro? yeah, i need to get this off
probably going to change that because it's probably not going to be good for the channel reputation
so we'll probably get luna out of the way from that intro of the stream
uh, why? um, should we buy now, or still wait? says, innocent
dollar cost average, depending if you are trading or if you are, you know, buying and huddling
uh, it's always good to dollar cost average, i think when the market goes down
hello, how are you doing? uh, what is up? my crypto legend says, matthew
el pink, how are you doing? um, you are the crypto king? uh, absolutely not
i feel like it could explode to 23 000 and then see a later back to test the lows
oh, how are you doing? uh, mark durch, thanks for joining right
i had someone saying, andy doesn't shower, right? it is time to shower
and, yeah, i've actually put some clone on as well, uh, even though you guys cannot smell it
you know, when people have a bad day? yesterday was my bad day
but we did mention, all right, yesterday, i'm in a short position
because yesterday we were talking about this scenario, even though probably a lot of people left the live stream or didn't watch it
okay? we had two scenarios here, all right? and you know, they were both, we were both looking for that bearish scenario, okay? we i do not want to long at resistance
why did i short this range? and this was talked about on yesterday's live stream
there was one scenario, being extremely bullish, you know, having that leg up to the next big, major resistance zone, to get a liquidity grab here, above twenty two thousand eight hundred dollars
uh? there was also, there was that scenario, okay? this is why, if you did enter a long position here a short story, you know, it's relatively tight
give it a little bit of room, just in case you do get that volatility and next few attempts to break the highs, give it a little bit of a room
but, um, you know, there was that scenario having that breakout from this ascending channel
we talked about this on yesterday's live stream, and, you know, it was saying, you know, this is very, very likely
they usually come back down to the support level and even break that level
so, you know, getting into the resistance for a short position is, is the correct thing to do, i think, especially like we were talking about yesterday
this, you know, this is a, this is a three to one shorting opportunity, right? because, you know, my take profit area was that twenty thousand four hundred dollars you mentioned on yesterday's live stream
i did enter the short, very, very small position, less than one percent of my capital
but looking for that, you know, rejection from this ascending channel was mentioned yesterday, i entered a short life, uh, you know, looking for that twenty thousand four hundred dollars
of course, i already collected more than fifty percent of this trade from yesterday's live stream
i am riding a free trade just in case, instead of a three to one trade, it's going to turn into a six to one trade, and we are going to have that leg down
so, uh, it might as well just hold some of that trade, because we have broken out from this, you know, support level
is it a successful breakout where we are getting resistance? we are getting that reaction from this range? so, you know, reason number one shorting this level was, it was the resistance from this ascending channel, as you can see, touching support higher lows and high highs
and also, it wasn't, for me, a successful breakout from this big, major zone
we had the value area high, okay? around about that 21, 300, we've got value area low, value area high over here
you need a solid breakout for this level to turn into kind of a support range, right? so i would have in be interested in shorting this
i would have been interested potentially and maybe longing this, at least to the 618 from the drop
so, you know, these were the kind of levels that i was looking at yesterday
and i just thought, you know, this is, you know, smart money is not buying, you know, this kind of momentum, especially not the highs of this range
they're very, very likely going to take profits with this, with this major resistance here, looking at the vpvr
the reason why, you know, and the reason why take profit one was this level, because this is the actual, you know, strongest range where we do have the spike on the vpvr
we're still holding the value area low from this, from this trading range, for the last 10 days
and also, we can see it here, you know, big, big level, big level
we are, retesting basically the the the back range, okay, of this major drop
just a quick explanation on what was mentioned yesterday, because a lot of people were bored from yesterday
we did talk about this scenario and actually shorted this life, uh, looking for that three to one risk to reward um and, you know, running a free trade to see if we can go much lower
so now, what could happen? most interesting thing, what could happen right now? well, we need to take a look at the dxy
and we're very likely going to retest this zone over here on the dxy, the 1048
if you go to the one hourly chart, you can see it is reacting to that level
there is a high probability that we might even, you know, get a big, massive correction from this range
if we start breaking this level here in the next coming hours, on the dxy, it's not going to be looking good
so the probabilities right now, from getting a correction on the dxy from this major resistance level, it has been retested once, we got a beautiful rejection once
will we get a beautiful rejection twice? this means that bitcoin will very likely continue to the upside
i want to um, ask the community, is bitcoin, is bitcoin going to hold the 19 19 um, 1920k levels? uh, for the coming weeks, for the coming weeks
i do think, you know, there is a possibility in a bitcoin actually losing this level, in my opinion, but probably not yet
if we do see bitcoin coming down, i think we are going to defend this nineteen thousand, eighteen thousand dollar range
and i think we're gonna go sideways for a bit, and then maybe continue back down
uh, i think this weekly close on bitcoin was very, very important
we had a very, very aggressive drop mass, you know, huge amount of weekly, uh, candlesticks here to the downside
i think you know, a few weeks of of defense, you know, over this level
i think it's very, very possible before actually, you know, having that last leg down, right till we find a floor level
but if you join, you know, if you join my team and join the telegram after joining the team, okay, you need to do this
and i think once we reach 200, i think that will be, you know, enough
i won't be talking about it the the competition starts in five days, guys, five days
and on the telegram group will be very, very active from the 25th of june, getting ready, getting those levels ready for those potential trades
and also on from the 27th, of course, i'll be more active even to look for those scalping opportunities
in the competition, we need to do scalping also, because swing trading, you know, you need to, we need to do more trades
really excited for the for the competition being active on the telegram group from the 25th of june
remember, guys, if you're not joining the competition, there is already over 50 people, or 60 that are not joined in the competition
please leave, or please do not join if you're not going to join the team
actually, we will go through bitcoin right away, because i do think lower is possible on bitcoin
we've lost the support range of this ascending channel right over here
but where to? where to? where would be my take profit to my take profit two would be here, exactly at the 19 400 and i will be maybe all, depending on how bitcoin reacts to this level
i think, you know, we might be actually having, uh, you know, can more continuation to the upside? i don't think in the next coming days, we're just going to collapse, lose the 18 000 lows here and and go to 12k in the next two weeks
a lot of, a lot of sideways action, a lot of this is what i think
this is why i think, especially after such an aggressive drop, you know, can it have continuation down? yes it can
but i think a couple of weeks here of kind of a little bit of volatility up and down, and then maybe continuation to the downside is is more likely
after such an aggressive drop, we need a cool off, right? we need a cool off of selling pressure
so if we do come down to this daily, what? daily? this is a very important daily level, the 19 400 range
it was apart from the alltime high, apart from the alltime high levels from 2017
we can see we have massive, massive consolidations here as resistance
we actually dipped below this range, but came straight back up
i think this daily level will react as support, just like we did see it reacted as resistance
i have this daily level because of, you know, it is a strong level
it was resistance, right? there was kind of a support right over here
if we continue back down here on on bitcoin, you know, i am looking for that round about that range, round about that daily level
this would be the projected move from the width of this ascending channel
you know, if you short here, you have a beautiful five to one risk to reward trade right there
so if we do hit that level, once you reach the target, the projected move, target of of a move, you're very likely going to consolidate at that level, get a reaction
if we do get that reaction here at the 19 400 range, plus minus a couple of hundred dollars, guys, this is never exact science, you can get that volatility at this range
if we do get that volatility at this level, you know, this has been a strong resistance zone here
also, you can see on the price action on bitcoin on the one hourly, we start getting that reaction, i would be very much interested to see a potential, you know, long trade here
um, only if we do get that reaction, guys, at that major daily level, four hundred dollar range
if we take a look at fibonacci retracement from the extreme lows here, created on the 19th of june, to the highs right over here on the 21st of june, yesterday
if we start making this kind of price action on the one hourly, on the 30 minute chart, getting a reaction, i mean, i would very likely be long in this
i'm looking for that price action on bitcoin to reach these levels
first, i will set an alarm here, of course, so i can get that message, then to check the charts and see how we react at that level
um, anyway, head and shoulder on the 15minute chart, uh, says leonel
on the 15minute chart, the dxy is still strong and cruising at 104, 880
got rejected here once, are we gonna get rejected twice? if it does get rejected twice, this will have a good effect on bitcoin
if bitcoin starts dropping right now and starts hitting that 19 500, 19400 in the next coming hours, and we do see the dxy getting a rejection from this range, this is going to be looking really pretty good
i will be, you know, i would, i would be more confident and long in bitcoin if we hit 19 400 range in the next coming hours
okay? if we suddenly start getting that drop right now, and we see the dxy getting that rejection in the coming hours, going sideways, i would say, wow, this is probably going to get rejected, and we're going to continue down on the dxy
so, yeah, i would want to see that move to the downside right now
now, the reason, another reason why um, bitcoin is getting a stop at this range is because we are hitting the 382 fib level
i think it's going to come lower to to round about that nineteen thousand four hundred dollar range
like i said, depending on how we react, i will be jumping on a trade
um, uh, brother, please check al goran buying rangers says, yeah, yeah, we can take a look at that also
let's take a look at um al gorand, no, sorry, let's take a look here at solana btc, because i got a super chat here from barat
let me just check here quickly, my mod chat, see how they're doing
what does solana btc tell us? um, long time since we haven't checked this out
well, just by looking at solana bitcoin, we did have a beautiful bounce from the range of the summer of 2021
we actually created a kind of, uh, kind of a symmetrical triangle, you could arguably discuss
the bounce from the highs, as you can see, was created just a few days ago on solana btc
so solana outperforming bitcoin for the last few days thanks to the bitcoin dominance dropping also
but is this going to continue higher, or are we going to correct? i think this is going to correct
right now, we can see these lower lows right there are getting resistance right now
we got this low, we got this lower low, it broke down, and we bounced to perfection
i mean, this is how, you know these sometimes these trend lines work like magic
had massive momentum to the upside, and now we are stopping at this level
so probabilities right now, what could happen? i mean, this, this has been a kind of a descending wedge, the lower highs, lower lows, descending wedge breakout to the downside
a leg down on the solana btc chart is more likely at this moment, after this big, massive pump, hitting a major resistance trend line right now that's been very well respected
will it form an inverse head and shoulder and and have a momentum to the upside in the coming weeks? it is possible
for the moment, i would say down at least to retest the low here, or a potential inversion and shoulder 618 level
probabilities is down for the next coming days, uh, on the solana btc chart
i guess, if you ask him for buying rages, rangers is not for trading, but good buying rangers
are these levels? um, if you asking for buying rangers, it's to buy and hold, i guess
and we were taking a look at this kind of abc, massive correction coming in between the first wave and second wave
lowest point here for our grand, for me, would be around about the 20 cent level
our grand is an incredible project, huge team, a lot of investors, uh, partners
i think it will do very well with a huge amount of partnerships and backup that they do have
we wouldn't successfully go down that level because we were, we have been consolidating, you know, 2019, 2020, at these levels, creating a big, massive spike on the vpvr, which will very likely hold the range for the next coming months
but we do have an alltime high back from before, probably, but the high that we did create in november, you know, it's almost around, about a 10x from these levels, alltime high be reached, i think
so it might take three or four years till we reach the oldtime high
we might just see six, 24 months of small relief pumps, a little more downside action, sideways action
so anyway, i think it's not confirmed, but the moment our grand starts going sideways, which i think is going to happen very, very soon, it will indicate a nice floor level
ada has been, you know, the best example i can get a bunch of cryptos that have done this
you know, we are probably at these ranges right now in this cycle, and it's just going to be boring
sideways action, some really pumps, more sideways action for several months
you know, only 5 or ten percent of people that invested in 2017 remain and start and continue buying
the five percent that stayed in crypto for those years made absolutely insane
and the 90, 80, 90 people that entered crypto here and left crypto here entered crypto back here
it's the same thing, not only for crypto, for the markets in general
uh, but you know, now it's just a little bit, with the thing of of facebook, and also with the crypto, then there's been a little bit of, a, of a big hype, a little bit of a bubble um
uh, andy, the simplicity of your charts is really helping me out
thank you very much for letting me, uh, for for that nice comment
we not try to keep it simple, not over complicate things on the chart
using a, uh, you know, supporting resistance levels, ascending, descending channels
trying to look, you know, vpvr also, uh, hope that the explanation on yesterday, you know, it was highly probable here of getting a rejection
there was also the possibility, you know, we had a pretty nice bullish momentum
we got those people already calling for, you know, we're going to 22k, we're going to 23k
we got all of those people hyped up on youtube, you know that this is bullish, we're going higher
you know, it was, look, we're looking for those shorts resistance from this ascending channel, and also just a liquidity grab above this last high over here
we've got value area low right over here, right now on the the the price action on bitcoin
is it a time too short or long? no, it for me, this is time to wait
if you did short here, you have a high chance on getting some more gains from this move
at this level would be my take profit too, depending on that consolidation at this level
why this level? very important? why this level? you already can see there's been, this level has been, you know, respected as resistance
twice, we've created a kind of a w pattern, broken up, managed to consolidate at this range, getting that reaction, continuation to the upside
it's a respected level from the past as support and resistance
if you go back in december of 2020, like i showed you, these daily levels are so important
four hourly levels, not that much, because there are dozens of four hourly levels every single day
um, but yeah, this is this daily level here, big, large consolidation as resistance back from december, november and december 2020
also why, if we take a look at easy, you know, simple, textbook technical analysis, the width of an ascending channel could give you that projected move down from the breakout, it looks like we are on our way
got stuck, um, got, um, stopped out at break even straight away
i did get stopped out, but it was a very, very small position
and, you know, it stopped out with a very good risk management
and this is the this is the deal, if you have good risk management, you just need a nice trade like this that will ride you down, you know
i've already taken, take profit one, take profit two, after breaking this ascending channel, you know that you can get stopped out five times, and you still be break even, or even have gains, you know
and i can't stress this enough, guys, the most important thing in trading is risk management
you can be, you know, you can have, you can read psychology books and and, you know, think and meditate and whatever, you can still lose money you have no risk management
you can, know, you can be the best trader, the best psychologist, you know, in trader, in trading, and lose money
i do very basic technical analysis, but very effective with risk management
i mean, this is up to you, where would you place your stop loss? you know, where could that, you know, you could get a bit, a little bit of a big relief rally
the level too short was here yesterday, hitting resistance, fake out
looking for that fake out, liquidity grab here from these highs of, um, you know, twenty one thousand three hundred, twenty one thousand four hundred value area high from the speed from this peak
you know, very likely we're not going to break above this range, because we are getting resistance from this trend line of these higher highs right over here
probably a lot of people left the live stream because it was crappy
i was, you know, there was no voice you could, uh, microphone wasn't on
we did talk about this on the live stream, this shorting opportunity from this resistance level, looking to come down to at least retest the lows of the channel, would be the take profit one from this support level
and i did take this short trade live yesterday at exactly the 21 500 area
so, um, as you can see, guys, remember, if you are interested in trading crypto, if you haven't got an account on buybit, you do get an insane bonus down below, okay, of up to four thousand and fifty dollars on buybit
if you're not signed up, i've got a full video tutorial also to learn how to use, you know, this platform, how to use the the leverage that they do have, isolated or margin
it's all explained on the video tutorial down below in the description
i did take a long position here on dax 30 on primex bt is looking a little bit bearish
there is a harmonic pattern, but we won't go through traditional markets
but anyway, primax bt is good to trade with other markets, such as s p 500, gold, crude oil, natural gas, using crypto as collateral
of course, these are my two favorite trading platforms, buybit and primaxpt
you do get an insane bonus down below on primaxpt, seven percent added to your deposit
you know, we also did take a look at waves yesterday, you know, looking for that it was, it was a little bit complicated here on waves
why was it complicated? because because, because, um, you know, we were hitting that 382 level yesterday on waves from this drop, right? we had a big drop on waves, okay, from the the first week of june until here, the the 14th, 15th of june, also, as you can see here
and we, we are hitting the the 382 to perfection, getting that rejection
so, yeah, i think the point zero, two, three was our take profit one if you were going to short this, because you could get a nice bounce from this level
it looks like that waves has created kind of a nice, huge double bottom
that that kind of take profit one where we did have a nice, nice consolidation here on the price action on waves at the 590, the 0236 on the fib level, 0382, getting that resistance volatility reaction, very likely to drop, especially after having that reaction, uh, after several hours
you know, if you go to the one hourly chart, you know, this is beautiful
i think waves could get a heavy balance from the point zero, uh, 0236
usdt, bernie, is this for real? is this for real? catfish? come on, i wouldn't be surprised that krypto being called catfish
can you check egold bro, see where is the possible bottom? let's take a look at egold right away
what's going on with e gold? are we going lower? oh, this looks pretty good
can you check e gold, please, bro see where is the bottom possible? oh, depending you know, where is the bottom to buy in? we didn't, we didn't, we could not call a bottom till we go sideways for some time
we are getting a bounce from this level that we'll take a look at up right now
the moment we go sideways, at least, you know, with pumps also, okay, you will be having some big pumps or and, you know, some big dumps, but the moment you start finding a nice floor level in two, three months, i would say guys, the bottom is probably in
the bottom is probably in, but it we, we're still having a pretty aggressive drop
this is the last two months we're still falling aggressively, still creating that, you know, aggressive lower high on e gold
it's very soon still, to to to to cold bottoms, in my opinion
we have a bunch of youtubers yesterday calling the bottom, is the bottom in? is the bottom in? it's probably not
anyway, this is um, a major support level right now, because we are, you know, there was a big resistance high on egold back in 2020 and even 2022
i mean, it's pretty crazy in all coins, because there's huge volatility
if you fast forward on this, if you are waiting for that level, guess what? you get a beautiful bounce from that range
this is why, when you're breaking zones, this is why, when you have a lot of price data on the chart, when you have a cryptocurrency or an asset that has been in existence for at least two years, or four years, or five years, even better, because you create major levels
okay? and once you start breaking these levels, you might think, oh, my goodness
where are we going to? where is the price going to stop? well, where you have had the largest consolidations, largest consolidations on egold, after, you know, this massive volatility low levels, you know, faster leg up here, from the 40 up to the 70 range
less than one week, where do you stop? you have a massive, you know, couple of weeks here of consolidation in january of 2021, massive, massive level
and, um, yeah, it was a pretty nice bounce on that just, um, you know, just less than one week ago
so what is happening on eagle right now is that we are hitting a resistance trend line
probabilities on e gold getting a rejection from this range is just very, very high
the probability and coming down to retest the 40 dollars is very high, in my opinion
lower highs, resistance trend line, touching to perfection here
this trend line was created already a few days ago, hitting the oof
i might be shorting this myself, if we do get another relief pump here and get rejected wow
that is going to be, get in the trade right away, because you're getting resistance here from the lower high trend line
confluence number one, you got the spike on the vpvr, which is, well, this one's around about the the value area low is at 64
on the spike on the vpvr, you are hitting the 50 fibonacci retracement from the start of this big, major drop, after the big relief rally
you are will very likely get rejected here at the biggest point of control from the volume traded of the last two months
you know, will we have that last volatility move? i've got, i've got here an alarm
i'm going to move this alarm actually, to the highs on on egold, just in case we do get that breakout, fake out
and if we start making that consolidation here the next coming days, it's going to be a must short opportunity
it's already looked like, it does already look like it's it's going to roll down from this level on eagle, 50
fibonacci trend line, confluence number two, uh, confluence number three
you know, this is enough, you know, big spike on vpvr levels here
we're almost hitting this, this low over here, almost hitting it
i mean, this is just a hot, very, very high probability on eagle getting, we are getting a reaction already
probabilities in the on e gold coming down from this range is just, you know, 65 70 of chance
let's do xrp, will btc done more? uh? says j dot, my opinion is, yes, i think btc will hit, um, 19 600, 19400
it is the projected move from this, you know, ascending channel breakout, approximately 1
looking for that 50 percent we are getting a bounce from the six were from the 382, sorry, from the low on bitcoin to the high
getting a reaction, i think, uh, break um continuation back down is very, very likely to at least around about the 50 percent, which would be 19 600, 19500
that would mean when i take profit, too, because we probably, if we do consolidate at that range, i will be looking for longing opportunities at that level
only if we consolidate, only if we do see the price action, getting a reaction from that range, then i would say, hey guys, i'm going to say here live, uh, you know, the deal totally transparent
i shorted this live, i shorted this live on yesterday's live stream, talking about two scenarios, the rejection from the resistance from this channel, coming back down to that twenty thousand, four hundred dollar range
you know, even, you know, even better, if you can protect your position, take profit, you know, your and actually break down, you're riding a free trade
instead of being a three to one risk to reward, it might be a five, six to one um
if i do, you know, if i am going to take a long position at this level, only if we come down there, and only if we consolidate there, only if we get a reaction from these important fib levels, important resistance zone
you know, uh, i will take the long position, and i will say it live here on the live stream or on a daily video
and where i would be placing stop loss? where do i see the risk to reward with the potential move to the upside? this will be said on on on the live stream
bernie, andy, can you please check safecoin? it was originally a camaro fork in 2018, but forked solana's blockchain later last year
i'll check it out, but we can take a look at the chart right away
unfortunately, we don't have any data here on safecoin, which is a pity
what exchanges do that? does it have save trade? yeah, i think we're not going to be able to take a look at save coin, unfortunately
so, yeah, but make sure to join, i think you are, in the telegram group
afterwards, we can share a little bit of chart, um, not charts, you know, a little bit of of what i think of the project
got joseph and mark derch, one of my strongest moderators here in the comment section
david, thank you very much for joining, also another strong moderator
what's pumping next? bro, do you have a trading group? bro um says burat, no
if you are going to join the world series of trading on bibit, you can join the telegram group down below
we'll be pretty active for the next 20 days, once the competition starts, from the 27th of june, till the 17th of july, it will be active
i am planning to make a very active trading group after the summer, because i want to get a very simple course out there for people to understand
i'm telling you, uh, talking about risk management, everybody's like, you know, the psychology, psychology
if you got good risk management, you will have fantastic psychology
if you don't have, if you have bad risk management, your psychology is going to be absolutely crap
and this is something gonna be priority in the course that i'm gonna do
you need to understand, before you do any type of trading, that if you do not have good risk management, you will burn your account very fast
and i know it's boring guys, but, and i know you, you know, you shouldn't be risking more than one, two, three percent is maximum
i usually trade, you know, one, two percent, or even less than one percent
this trader i have open, it's less than one percent of my capital, uh, my trading capital, and buy it
but this is why most of the people don't make consistent gains and don't make money and can't make a living out of trading, simple as they have bad risk management
you cannot make trades of over, you know, 500, even though 10 000 looks pretty good on your account, on your trading account
if you're risking more than 500 per trade, yeah, you know, you're not going to be consistent
um, barat, so anyway, if you're going to join the, the, the the bibit competition, we'll be very active in the telegram group
let me go through the poll here, because my question is, is bitcoin going to hold the 1920k levels for the coming weeks? and 54, 54 of people say no
you know, right away, shiva, you know, us dollar or us dollar tether
you know, um, these all coins, these meme coins, because they do not respect the levels
if i would have shorted this, looking for the support, support range turning into resistance, uh, i wouldn't have traded
something good that we did get that rejection from the biggest point of control
you know, this is how powerful, you know, the volume profile can be sometimes
big point of control here, from this level, you can see this was, this was a level number two mentioned on on a live stream not long ago, because we did talk about this very much respected zone on on shiba inu
i mean, i would swear we talked about this major support level also
and if we do not react at this one, second level where we could get rejected on chiba ena was this one right over here, the biggest point of control right there
this was a beautiful shorting opportunity, i bet myself, you know, what was it on yesterday's live stream? it must have been on yesterday's live stream
but looking for that massive rejection from this level on shiba inu, no doubt in my mind
because of this consolidation and these bounces are at this support level, that was an insane shorting opportunity, very likely when you get these hype pumps
um, what now on chiba? well, we could get that bounce from these lows
what is a major level where we could bounce on shiba inu? stay cautious if you're longing, because you are fighting the a downtrend
but you could get a short term bounce from this level on shiva inu
you got a strong, strong resistance zone that should be turning into support right there
and if we take a look at the six, it's just around about the 618 level also, from this low to the high of the pump, 61865 range is actually at this level also
if you consolidate, it's a, it's a nice, quick long opportunity
you might create a lower high here, because we are an aggressive downtrend
the best one would have been this one, right there at the point of control break out here
if we break up this level, we will be very likely going to get rejected from this other level
i'm really sure it's on yesterday's live stream, or before yesterday's live stream
uh, before yesterday 21st, we did take a look at shiba inu on the pump
um, let me just, let me just try and find it, because i just want to see this
you know, this is why it's so important to take a look at those level to levels areas for potential shorting opportunities
um, was she be even talked about yet? it must have been talked about yesterday
major resistance level where we could have taken that short never mind
xrp, xrp, you've been, you know, you'll be wanting me to take a look at xrp for ages, ages
so if it doesn't respect levels, if it doesn't respect my kind of ta, i just won't do ta, and i won't trade it
but anyway, if you ask for it, we can take a look at it right away
zooming out here on the daily, actually, on the three day chart
getting at the very end here of this, you know, there's this, um, not not apex, but we created the high here at 90 cents, got rejected, you know, just just so you can take a look at here, why we did, you know, this is a, this is really a bullish pattern, right? when you are creating higher lows and you are finding a support level, you having the demand pushing up
but overall, you know, if you have a small bullish pattern inside of a massive, big bearish trend, to the downside
and we have these aggressive lower highs, trend line, just about to hit that trend line over here, finally breaking the higher lows
very likely you are going to retest the lows here of the trend line
now what is happening on xrp right now is we are getting a reaction from this level
why? because we have been consolidating here for a long, long time
look, if i just get a box here, you know, there is a large, large consolidation at this range
in between, you know, 20 cents, 19 cents, 18 cents and, you know, 40 cents, large, large consolidation at this range
what has happened with this consolidation is that we have created a big, massive area with big volume, on the volume profile
so if you are looking to buy xrp for the long run, maybe these are levels, but you know, xrp, it might be one of those failed projects
i remember, back in 2019 and 2020, xrp army was huge, absolutely huge
you know, this might be one of those that on the next, you know, cycle, it won't even break the last alltime high, and it will create, uh, another lower high
you know, who knows? this is probably going to be a dead project
why the heck are we in crypto? we are here for decentralization
i like binance to buy some cryptos, maybe because it's one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, but it's totally centralized
what happened when the price action dropped the last couple of weeks? guess what? finance suspended transactions
uh, a lot of youtubers created their channels off xrp, says hugh
okay, uh, but xrp is extremely cheap in terms of transaction fees
this is also true, but it's not, you know, the uh, you know, this is the thing
it must be, it must be this one, right? yeah, this is the one, i guess
i guess you are asking for, the one that was added on by a bit, that had a big, massive hype
looking at the four hourly on unifi, it doesn't look too bad, actually, it doesn't look too bad
i think it might, you know, this is already looking at it looks like we are finding floor levels on unify, a lot of sideways action
is the selling pressure over, and we are going to get a spike in, in in price action to the upside in the next coming days? it is very, very possible
you know, this was added on by it, you know, i think, well, about a month ago, a month ago or two months ago, there was a massive, huge spike here
it must have been some bullish news or speculation on this crypto
um, uh, andy, please woo usdt, yeah, we'll take a look at that one afterwards
but, yeah, unifi, i mean, there's not much to do to add up here
i think it does, it does look like we're looking, it looks like it wants to find a floor level
what can we see on unifi? i mean, this is a very, very hard one
you know, you could arguably discuss also that you have broken here from this higher low level, and you are going to come lower
i'll tell you what, if we do lose this range, then, all depending if you're in a short position or if you're in a long if you do lose this last low area from this high low trend line, you're getting a reaction right now
you could get supported and have a little pump before potentially continuing back down
um, if you break this low here at the 480 level, uh, you're very likely going to come down to retest the lows here at the 410 range, and then maybe consolidate even more
yeah, very, very aggressive downtrend, i think, yeah, i think lower is possible
i mean, and this could have a big, massive spike like this, or a big spike to the downside
um, uh, what cryptos should i buy if i have 250 in hand? it's, i mean, dollar cost averaging is the best strategy
been in existence for over, is it 10 years right now, 2014, i think
theory, blockchain is going to be here in the next coming years and will do well
you can lose, you know, you can, you can be in a loss by over 90 percent on these cryptos
um, andy, what are the best cold wallets to use? i i got ledger nanos
uh, there's, that's my favorite cryptocurrency, called wallet
i will be doing a video update to see what is going on with bitcoin
we'll be trading some all coins on the world series of trading competition
maybe the 196, 194 range is gonna be my take profit two from this short
and you know, if we do consolidate next coming hours, couple of days, it might be a good longing opportunity
i think we could be hitting that 50, 618 level, daily level, big resistance zone
if the price action starts dropping heavily and you enter a trade with this price action, you haven't been patient
you haven't waited for the reaction, you haven't waited for a consolidation to take that opportunity

don't forget that you can also receive the best bonus all the bonus has been changed
if you want to be part of my, uh, the consensus telegram group, you have it in the link in the description, but i will also give it to you right now in the in the live chat
so if you want to be part of my community, where we talk about, uh, cryptocurrencies, we just, you know, we're talking about trading overall
so we saw the market, or i saw the market at 1090 on on ethereum this morning from the morning livestream that we did have
and if you are, if you uh, don't know, i have morning live streams every single day from monday to friday, one hour before a london session opens
we all so we almost had our stoploss getting hit, almost, almost, almost
another thing that i did was that, when i saw that the market pulled back up, because we took this, uh, trade base, or i took this trade based on a fibonacci that i did have
but if we just drag the fibonacci up a little bit more, and i wanna take it from this high or, uh, okay, so we can take it from now, i would actually use it from one thousand three hundred and one thousand one hundred thirty
the market came exactly and we tested, uh, 50, 104 fibonacci level
we could also have taking the fibonacci from 1000, um, one thousand one hundred and twenty
uh, you can see also here how perfectly the market actually we tested
can i, can i share a link from a trading view photo? yes, of course, pedro, you can do that
of course, share it, and i can, uh, just copy it and give me what you or tell me what you want us to look at
so, yeah, uh, right now we do, as i said, um, we do have the news coming out
and usually when the, when the news comes out, when it comes to feds, the market is, can be a little bit volatile
um, and we're about right now pulling back up to the entry one more time and retesting the 50, as you can see
take this one away, and we are retesting, uh, 1, 1888 and 1 000
but if we go to the higher time frames, because right now it's actually, it's better for us to look at the higher time frames perspective, um, because the the higher time frames is obviously the one that is leading the way
and based on that, we actually can see the market pull back up a little bit now
um, we just might see the market with the fed meeting, where the fed comes out, if we are bullish, we can come back up and retest 1127, potentially 1140
um, so when does this four hourly candles close in one minute and 30, yes, sorry, one hour and 35 minutes
we broke the so if dollars pulls back up, bitcoin goes down, and we are retesting the trend line that we broke
and this is where we could potentially see the market reverse back up
if this red candlestick is closing below the trend line, this could definitely be where the market pulls back down a little bit more
because you can see that we are retesting the trend line from below, which means that on bitcoin, we can have the momentum to the upside right now
it's a little bit risky, i'm not gonna lie to have, i'm already, i'm in a trade on bitcoin since yesterday, and i i saw the market at 21 040 um
but if we're looking at bitcoin right now, on the overall picture, we retested 21 040
and that is the, that is the, that is the, uh, the key level that would you have
um, i just want to see, so what i try to do when i look at the higher time frames
guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
but usually when it comes to the meetings, you see the market pull back up first, and then you see the drop
and if you're looking at bitcoin right now, this is, technic, the the lower low that, this is the first lower low that we did create from the break of structure
so we just might see the market pull back up to 20 720 or 20 860, and then see the market potentially drop
right now, the market usually be usually a little bit crazy, as i said, um, the only thing that i think about is the trade that we are in right now on that i'm on on ethereum
and i don't, i'm gonna be honest, i'm not, i don't like the position at all based on the meeting
so we take the fibonacci from the last high at 1067 back down to the low at 1 1071
and you know what? i'm actually gonna close my position right now on ethereum a little bit and draw down
i want to find another entry on ethereum, because i don't like, as i said, i don't like the oh, yes, salty, you can definitely share that
so what do you think will happen? guys? what do you think will happen? so we have another 30 minutes, candle now, opening
below this trend line, we broke the support trend line retested
so yeah, market is going i i definitely believe that we will have a pool pull back now to the upside um
if the market pulls back up to 1130 and 1120, this is where i potentially can see the market reverse then back down
so do you have the pullback? as you guys know, i was in a self position a bit on ethereum, i closed my position right now because i want to find a better position, because we, yeah, if we're not just dropping right now, but i don't think that will happen
looking at the five minutes chart, you could see the retest from the support trend line
now the resistance trend line on the 15minute chart, we do have an inverted hammer
so we just might see the market pull back up and retest this level again, and then see the drop
could have gotten another 40, but it was 2 and i needed to sleep
this is what i talk about when the, when the fed meeting, when the fed is talking, when they talk, usually now, because we're on the opposite um, i will take a sell limit order right now on ethereum instead
i still strongly believe that the market will pull back up to this level
how are you? where is your stoploss with btc shorts? my stoploss is at [Music]
so i had my my stop loss at twenty one thousand three hundred and ninety
so i so this is on by bit now, so it can be a little bit differently
oh, i do have a pretty pretty tight cpu when it comes to bitcoin, to be honest
um, i have it at, why do i have it at 19 000? i should have it
where's the next seventeen thousand and forty? what do i do? i need key la, la, la levels
i i might take profit on, uh, bitcoin at 17 040, because that is the key level
um, okay, we can go to ada, because they wanted me to look at it
so on ada, we just might have a pullback to, uh, zero point four thousand eight hundred and six
we just might potentially also see another pullback up to zero point, four thousand nine hundred and thirty six
30 came up exactly, and we tested three thousand thirty thousand three hundred and five
i did close my position right now on bitcoin, and i will take another one and my so let's see
why does it do that, darling? let's see if we will have some movement soon
why? okay, so based on that, we broke the support trendline, but we came back down, and we tested the previous higher low on the four hourly charts
um, this is the level we could potentially see the market pull back up to
everything depends, but i mean, if the market is not suit i mean, of course you can see the market pull back up to the fibonacci levels, but it doesn't, doesn't be it has to be super crazy
can you see how perfectly the market did what i said it was supposed to do? so after this candlestick, we saw the retest of the support at the resistance trend line
so right now bitcoin and all of the other pairs against usd can start to move to the upside soon
so if we're looking at dollars though, and see where it can potentially come back down to, if we take this one away, go down to the higher time frames, um, we just might pull back down to 100, 103847 again
natalie only takes coins suggesting, yes, if you have guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
so if you haven't already like the live stream, we start to see that bitcoin pulls back up, and while it does that, i'm gonna introduce you to my youtube channel
i've been in trading since 2018, and right now, what i do is that i share my knowledge with you guys
so if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, do you do that? go down to to my other videos
i have some back testing sessions together with you that you can go back and look at
what i do on the charts, you can do that on every every pair, forex, index, oil, gold, you can do you can do this on everything
um, if and don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so we did have this, but i'm going to change my, i'm going to change it to this one
so we just might see if we have a bigger if we if, because we're retesting the fibonacci levels right now
but if you would see the market pump up a little bit, this just might be
i was coming back up and retest sixty thousand sixty two, sixtytwo dollars, and then potentially see a drop
i do expect the drop, but based on the meeting, we do have a a push right now
um, what else did you want me to would you look at? egld, let's see bat
can you see how good it was that i closed my position on bitcoin and on ethereum, just to find other better positions
okay, so on batch, we can pull back up and retest zero point three thousand seven hundred and fortytwo
uh, potentially zero point three thousand, seven hundred and six
if that is the case, take profit one is zero point three thousand, four hundred and sixty six
take profit two, zero point three thousand, two hundred and seventy six
and take profit three, zero point three thousand, one hundred and four
i would, i would have it above these highs um the previous higher high
now, you know how happy the girl's gonna be when you men do that to us
okay, we're looking at solana taking this baby away, because it's not valid at all, is it? comp okay, so we're gonna look at comp after this one
take uh, entry could be around six, uh, thirty, six point thirty dollars
why? that's not what do you say? do you want someone to come and buy you a buy your dinner? since when did a woman become a man? come on, come on guys
we could potentially pull back up and retest 418, 418 or 4141
only if that is the case and we see the market drop overall, if the market will now reach us this level, we're also retesting a previous lower low
how does dxy look at a 88? we can pull back up potentially to, uh, zero point four thousand eight hundred and five, or zero point four thousand eight hundred and fifty
if this fibonacci is valid, take profit one is a four thousand five hundred and eighteen
take profit two, four thousand three hundred and say profit three, four thousand one hundred and twenty
when my friends call me nowadays, i don't even say hello, it's natalie
don't you know who you're calling? you press natalie, right? why do i have to say my name? why are you not smart? my friends loves me
we can pull back up now to potentially, uh, 699 or 707 dollars
if that is the case, take profit one will be six point forty seven dollars
i'm not financial advisor, but i would have it above one of the highs right here
power tells congress the fed is strongly committed to bring down the inflation
federal reserve chairman roma told commercial lawmakers wednesday that the central bank is determined to bring down the inflation and has the ability to make that happen
at the fed, we understand the hardship high inflation is causing
we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we're moving so the fed, we we have both the tools we need and the result it takes to restore
however, acknowledged inflation is running too hot and needs to come down
over the coming months, we will be looking for completed ones that inflation is moving down consistently, with inflation returning to two percent
paul said we anticipate the ongoing rate increase will be appropriate
the pace those changing will continue to depend on the incoming data that's involving outlook for the economy
he noted that the war in ukraine and covetlinked shutdowns in china are adding to the inflation pressure
powers iron markets are part of the mandates report on monetary policy, more commonly known in the markets as the sorry, i'm just reading out loud
but over its past three meetings, the central bank had raised, okay, we're heading up
uh, well, paul didn't say anything bad, neither anything good
so it's neutral, similar to closer remarks during the internet rate increase
but we have to break, oh, we have to match you to measure in the house
so we need a little bit more push when it comes to, wait, use 30
what is a good short entry for b2c? uh, we have, or i have my sell limit order at twenty one thousand and twenty
so us30 is usually very, very volatile when it comes to, uh, hello to masha
so if you want, if you're in england, you want to eat strawberries, you can go to tomasu, because he, he and his wife does some great cakes, you know
you got nothing to say about about that great thing that i closed my positions on bitcoin and ethereum? right? it took another cell opportunity
so everything depends on if i would choose to take the 50 or the the 618 percent stop loss
this vacation, i will only do a marathon on the livestreams that you do
hey, nat, i might have missed it, but what is your entry above faith on b2c? uh, we have the entry on btc at okay
and on ethereum, the entry is at one thousand one hundred and thirty, one hundred and thirty
you know when you hear yourself sometimes, when you're like, what do you sound like then? and it's not good that i blonde either, because i sound so stupid
imagine me standing there and say, news, why? why are we stupid? why do we do things like this to people? ah, guys, i'm not, i don't like that
if i, if i would stand there, i would say, everyone a bitcoin census community, you sell the market right now, right now
but we can definitely have a little bit more push to the upside
i'm not sure if this 50 was no, just, i i have to take this call
when it comes to us, 30 always respects the highest time frames
what on nasa? we saw the market pull back up to the higher time frames
do you think in swedish when you're speaking in english? ah, i'm not sure
dina, do you really sit and think wonder natalie's thinking in sweden
yeah, i'm gonna hold my positions around these levels, to be honest
hello? is it a diamond pattern on c98? i've never used the diamond pattern
byron, i do have sell limit orders on bitcoin and on ethereum, so on ethereum
i have it at, okay, so we i have a sell limit order at 21 020
um, i usually, i don't actually even use patterns, to be honest, because, um, [Music]
i just kind of look at what i see on the charts, and i usually use the fibonacci levels
exactly we have to measure in the house is also, everyone is diamonds
can you see how perfectly the market came back up to this level at 22 dollars? wow
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that and see the notifications so you know when i am live next time, or when i do have my daily updates
if you want to learn more how to be a trader yourself, you can go and look at my my market structure, part video
on part two, part one and part two, i also show a little bit about fake outs, country trend lines
if you want to back test with me, i also have some back testing sessions right here, where i show you exactly how i back test the charts
and so bring pen and paper and become a great student, and then you practice that on the charts
natalie, can you show us your history on google? i think i saw application for a job at mcdonald's
are you trying to be funny right now? okay, so we did retest the fifty percent at zero point five hundred and ninety seven
we just might see the market pull back up, retest it, and then see the market drop
right now, the seagulls outside my window window is going local
can it be so hard for the market to pull back up? because i need to go
okay, guys, i need to go because i have some duties that i must do right now
um, but as i said ethereum, i have a sell limit order at 1130
so let's see if the market would now break to the downside and not come up to these levels
what i would look for is that if we break below this previous high at 1130, we just might see the market come back up and retest it and then see the drop
um, i do have a sell limit order at twenty one thousand and twenty
and guys, i will do some updates, obviously, but and if you want to be part and see the updates, because i cannot give you the updates on bitcoin, uh, on youtube
but you can still be part of bitcoin census, natalie community
we just might also come to seven point six dollars for a retest
uh, comp is right now we are above the fifty percent, and we just might see the market pull back up to forty one point eight dollars
solana is, uh, trade is active right now to, uh, the 50, but we can also pull back up to 368 dollars
so what is your percentage of take profit at each fib extension? i mean, it's different every time
it depends on what, um, i don't even think i understand what you talk about
how are ya? uh, do you close your position if third fib extension is reached? uh, yes, i usually do that
fanboy, i did close my, um, i did close my btc and ethereum trade before
how do you elevate your take profit when reaching first? i'm just so focused right now on bitcoin
i mean, i seriously, i don't even understand that evaluate word
that how i can you speak normal with me? this girl is either high or just drunk
do you close one to five of your positions when it's reaching fab extensions? when it takes my and when i take my take profit, it takes my take profit
did we have the fed live? um, the thing is that i'm not sure if i'm allowed to have it on youtube, because i'm, i'm super scared when it comes to youtube and me using things, because they actually closed me
um, they actually, i'd open only fast account and send leverage
so we're just waiting for the market to do whatever it is supposed to do
if your name isn't anthony joshua, i don't want you to talk to me like that, you know
if there's anyone else who wants to be disgusting, you know exactly what's gonna happen
do you seriously think that it's fun for me to sit here and watch? i know it's a lot of people who doesn't do that, but when people are discussing like that, seriously, just because i sit here, i'm a woman, you can you think that you can talk to me in that type of way? hell, no
when i sit here and share my thoughts with you, and some people come in here and think they can be disgusting, towards me
okay, so looking at xt sata, we can pull back up to one point four hundred and thirty five, potentially one point four hundred and fifty four
who's not like that? so i don't want to brag and take everyone over just because one one is stupid
i don't want to say that everyone's that like that, but it's definitely common, and i don't think it's okay, you look nervous so easily
if i don't like someone, that person will know that, not that i don't like them, but, you know, you know, i'm the worst liar ever
hopefully the market will just retest it and just then go down
and not you have any coins? uh, i'm waiting for, oh, yeah, i had a mentor before, but he's not doing this anymore
so we are about to retest the entry on ethereum, we're close on bitcoin
should i drive fibonacci from retro candle bars or wigs? i take it usually from the i take it from the body to body, usually
and i always say that you should, um, i always say that you should backtest it yourself to see what what works for you
because i think it's more, i think it's more about what you what you backtest yourself and feel comfortable with
and i don't care about that, because as long as i trade, i am happy
how are ya guys? if you have, okay, we have some movements to the upside

if you want to be a part of my bitcoin census natalie community, you have that in the live stream chat right now
i don't have a fibonacci tutorial at the moment, to be honest
i definitely want the market to pull back up, but, i mean, i can't do anything more than just sit and wait for it, just like you guys do
uh, do you see the market by any chance going higher than your stoploss? and np, i'm not sure
uh, when you be live until we hit those entry points? i don't know
i mean, obviously we can look at other coins too, but we're just waiting for them to pull back up, right? it's the same thing on everyone
natalie, what is your entry on bitcoin? uh, my entry is, uh, no, uh, it is twenty one thousand and twenty
how do you find these key levels that you have? roman, it's a secret side of my brain
this is the thing, when it comes to use, when it comes to index parents, they go crazy
this is a supply zone where we can see the market pool pull back up to for retest and then potentially see the drop
so while we're waiting for bitcoin and ethereum to reach our targets, tell me where you from

you know what i'm actually gonna, ah, how many pips? is it from the entry? it's not that many pips right now
you know what i'm gonna go into, i'm gonna close my sell limit orders, and i'm gonna go into market execution right now, because we're not super far away
so market sell, and i'm gonna still have the same so bitcoin, first of all, take profit on bitcoin
so i am right now in two and one position on ethereum and one on bitcoin at the moment um, because we're not so far away
and if we look at the lower time frames, i mean, the market can obviously pull back up to it, but this is my decision that i take
i'm going to make everyone coffee, two sugars and milk, right? yes? byron, uh, no, lacto, no milk for me

and so if you, if you are in my community, if you are in my community, um, i actually, i gave everyone the entry that i, even though i'm no financial advisor, i gave everyone the entry, uh, yesterday, because we didn't have anything during the live streams
but this baby was beaut it fall when i say this trade was like, this was the best you can you could not had a better entry on bitcoin yesterday
but, um, i took, i texted everyone that i did have a settlement order at 21 040 on bitcoin
um, don't forget, guys that you can also, obviously receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
but the trade that, uh, that i took on bitcoin yesterday was, it was, it was a great one
so we're just, i'm just waiting for the market, obviously, to continue to drop
um, so, yeah, if you, if you have, if you are not part of the community, because obviously this is where, um, i do have more updates, because it's, it's not as easy to have the updates on youtube every time
so if you want to be part of my community, natalie, bitcoin census, um, you have the link in the chat pinned
and in this community, we, we just talk about we, which is a great community
and i share sometimes when i trade, even though i'm no financial advisor and a lot of other people has been developing so much when it comes to their own charts, when it comes to their own charts
uh, because they, yeah, they just do what they're supposed to do, and they take knowledge, the knowledge that i share, and then create it to their own knowledge
so i just want to say i'm super proud of everyone that work, work their butt off
you know, you should be proud of yourself, because it takes time, and it takes a lot of effort to do it
uh, of course, first of all, we can go to the calendar, because it's really important to see what's happening during the day
and we do have news coming out today at new york session, the, the, uh, the federal, uh, fetching power talks again
and if the market is, uh, going down, um, if the market is now potentially about to to continue back to the downside, we can expect the market to pull back to the upside
so when usually, what i've noticed, at least, is that when when you have news coming out, they the market goes to the opposite direction
so when the market goes down, the market goes up when the news comes out
definitely, where we can find another great, or i can find another great, uh, opportunity, potentially to sell the market
but everything depends on where we are in the market and how it and how it looks
do we come back up and retest, you know, previous support and resistance, or fibonacci levels? because that is usually what the market is doing
if you haven't already, livestream, where almost 100 people on this live stream is 28 people
so we know that during new york session today, the market will be a little bit volatile
um, so yesterday, on yesterday's live stream, uh, that i did have, was it around i don't remember exactly when it was, but i remember that we were above the support trend line
what i did was that i took the fibonacci, uh, based on the key levels that i've had since, like two weeks ago, i think
and this is actually something that i've learned after these two couple of weeks, is that i can actually use the fibonacci between the key levels, um, and the market respect these levels really good
before i i also use, of course, fibonacci with lower lows and lower highs and higher highs and higher lows with market structure
but this is the thing, guys, when you start playing around with the charts and just practice it, you can actually see that fibonacci also works very good with key levels
and, um, no, wait, did i take my food? yeah, i took my fibonacci from 23 040 back down to 19 040
and all of these, um, uh, all of these key levels is so respected
i put first like natalie, not because you make coins, i am 25 plus years in the market, make crazy money, but only because you're a good person and you helping people, new people, for example
so i did obviously use the connection with the support trend line that is representing the the the option in this case, because when the market goes down, the pullback is to the upside
so when the market breaks, when the market breaks, the um, market structure, which we actually did
but why i did have the sniper entry was also because i went down to the lower time frames and i took a fibonacci from, uh, 21 390, back down to this low at 20 685
so we had three confirmations, or i got three confirmation that this, uh, that this level was the most respected one, because the 50, we had the key level, 21 040
and the confirmation on the higher time frames, fibonacci, based on the key levels, the 50 was at 21 040
and the the the time, the fibonacci on the 15 minutes chart, the 50 was also connected to exactly 21 040
and now we are in profit, or i'm in profit, uh, and the take profit is at 19 850
so i did base this one on the fibonacci that i took my trade from
so i'm gonna move my stop loss, obviously, uh, to to entry soon
um, so, yeah, this is what i look right now and to see where we could potentially, if we can, we can definitely find another opportunity
so if we would see another, uh, pullback to the upside at the moment, what i will do is that i will take a fibonacci from 20 943 back down to 20 290
and that gives me fibonacci levels at twenty thousand six hundred and thirteen and twenty thousand six hundred and ninety
so this will be a potential next level for me to sell the market from on bitcoin
um, i usually, when the market has already already started the move down, i usually take the, i usually take the 50 as a entry
um, everything depends, but i always use the 50 or the 618 when it comes to, when it comes to entries on based on the fibonacci level
um, so looking at this level right now, and the take profit, i got three take profit based on this one
um, everything also depends, obviously, the fed meeting, how how volatile the market will be
um, on my first trade that i am in right now, in case we see this huge momentum to the upside, because we never know how far the market will take us to the upside if that's the case
uh, hopefully the drop will come and just take to take profits though
take profit one is at twenty thousand one hundred and thirty seven
and take profit three is at key level, nineteen thousand and forty
and we can okay, so we right now see a little bit more of a drop
so, uh, i did have a, a, i did not have a settlement order on ethereum yesterday
the market never had the power to to, uh, to come to that level
and, yeah, you know, sometimes that happens, sometimes that happens
and remember when i told you on yesterday's live stream why it is so important that we wait for the market to break the support trendline before i choose to take a trade
and this is because if we don't, if we, if that is not happening, we're just gambling with our account
i understand that in the beginning it is like that, but we definitely need to be very serious when it comes to the charts
i think everyone needs to go through that for you to then understand that you need to be, you need to be patient about it
but if we would see, the market can obviously continue to drop right now
and if the market continues to drop, i will not have a, i don't have a setup, uh? because i need to buy a sell the market from the lower high
so on ethereum, i take the fibonacci from 1135 back down to 1800, 1087, which gives me fibonacci levels 1111 and 116
so even if we see the drop, you can, you can definitely see the market pull back up
if the market continues to drop and give me other levels to look to look at, we just have to follow the trade
we just have to follow the charts, right? oh, the baby's going down, babe
this is why you should follow my youtube channel if you haven't already liked the live stream
we can reach out to more people, and we can show them, hey, this is actually pretty easy to trade the market if you only have the right guidance and look at the market from from an easy perspective
and if you're new to the channel, you can also use crypto trading for beginners
because if you want to be as good as, uh, me and a lot of other people when it comes to technical analysis, market structure is key
that's how i'm able to figure out where the market can come to
experience, guys, we need the experience in front of the charts
they say that you should sit at least 10 000 hours back testing before you become, you can even say, to become a good trader
i've been doing this since 2018, every single day, and i know exactly the struggle
but going to my crypto trading for beginners, market structure, part one, and part two is the best one
i also have the back testing live streams that you can look at, where i just backtest the charts
you know, that's what we need to do when we if we want to become good traders, right? um
and don't forget that on buybit, you can also receive the great bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
but we are already in, i'm already in the trade since 2021, 040, which is beautiful
and let's see what happened to us 30, because we were looking at you as 30 yesterday too
so we were at the higher time frames, fibonacci, uh, since yesterday on, i saw on you on us 30, i told everyone that, uh, we can break above 30 398
that can have definitely happened on the higher timeframes, fibonacci, that you see the market break above it
i don't remember exactly if the it was the morning or if it was on the evening
but can you see, i said, if we break below the 50, 30 hundred and thirteen and see a retest
and guys, everyone can do this, as long as you're just practicing on the charts
um, so what we can do, uh, is that what we could have done was took a fibonacci from the last lower high at zero point, 2773, back down to the support ads
can you see the i mean, this is, i'm not even joking when i say this works
i want, i just want you to know that, but when i give you the setups, i'm not telling you that you should take the trades
but if you don't fall, if you, if i give you what i see on your coins, it is your job to follow that
i'm not even gonna, i'm gonna, i'm not even gonna joke about it
say, profit two is at zero point, two thousand four hundred and eighty three
uh, three is at zero point, two thousand four hundred and eleven
um, we will also go through, i'm gonna go through what what we went through yesterday, just to show you exactly, uh, looking at waves
you can, uh, we could probably also use six point eight to six dollars if we would see a push to the upside, retest and then continue back down
does matt buy the market? and that that's why you bullying him? we love, we love um, matt low, how do you decide where to start the fib um? so i i, i use it in a downtrend
but i couldn't, i tried to connect it with other, uh, other tools on on the charts
ray liquia, like, no, you're not finnish, but it's like, do we have, do we have people from, uh, finland here? egld, do we have any finnish people in here? no, my father is actually from finland
oh, but your language actually sound like finnish? i remember i was, uh, because i can't speak finnish, but i remember one time i was, i was listening to some people, and they said that they were from estonia, and i was like, you sound just exactly like the finnish people
so looking at ejld, we had the great, let me look at this guys, one of the of youtube's live streams that i that i always wait for
so market on egld, what i said yesterday? uh, 60 points around the last higher low, we could see break retest
so when you ask me, how do i take the fibonacci, i play around with it
so right now, i try to, you know, just right now, to see, because the market has already done the move
what happens? market connects exactly with the previous higher low
came back up really tested at 50 and 61, at six to sixty dollars and sixty point sixty dollars
can you see the drop is happening right now in front of our eyes? lauren is here
use dt, okay, so it looks kind of the same, uh, when it comes to the because it was a long time ago i was looking at this pair
long time ago i was looking at this pair, it feels like, okay, let's go to the weekly chart, just to have an overview
what's poppin? what's poppin? okay, so the weather in sweden is really boring
it's like, i have my windows open, and it smell because it's so wet outside
so we came and retested the fibonacci level 0650 on the higher time frames, which is really important for us
um, another thing here then, uh, looking at the lower time frames
um, take fibonacci from zero point six thousand six hundred and thirty six back down to zero point six thousand three hundred and eighty eight
and we tested the fifty percent one more time on the higher time frames at six thousand five hundred and fifty five
and i took in other fibonacci from from the last high high to the lower low
i don't have anything else at the moment, because the market has already retested the fibonacci, and now it's supposed to go down
um, so yeah, that's why you should always be updated with me, because we saw this coming yesterday
actually, we all of the trades that we take, we took right now, is based on the analyzes that we did yesterday
so i always say that we need to be patient about the traits, because look at happy we are now when we actually take our time to to um, let the market do whatever it's supposed to do, right? uh? the clicks and the keyboard gives me a asmr, don't fall asleep
okay, looking at rndr, overall picture, we're obviously in a huge downtrend
i do have some underlying analysis scenes before well, i will
it looks like we're going back down to zero on this girl, baby boy
so when i take my, when i take my trend line, uh, i would i go to? i go to the time frames where i see the best market structure
because on the four hourly, you could see that you just see the market, um, having one huge big, you know, we have, the only thing that we can look at is the bullish candlestick, right? going to the lower time frames, even if we look at the same thing, it looks better when you understand and see how market structure is moving, right? and we saw that the market broke below the level, and we came back up
and we tested this previous high high, also this previous higher low
and what did the market do? we we broke the support trend line, which is the best confirmation
but when we break the support trend line, the market will create a lower low, right? and we, we don't do anything from the lower low
what we wait for is to see when where the market can give us the lower high and then see the drop, right? and so what i always do is that i take fibonacci from the last higher high to the next lower, uh, lower low
okay? so you can see right now, that the market broke above the 618 percent
and maybe someone could be like, yeah, the market is not respecting the fibonacci levels
what we have to have in mind is that we can also use other tools like support and resistance zones
and in this case, what i also did was that i connected it with the last, with one of the last high highs, with the last higher low
and the market never had the power to to retest this level as another high high
and what did the market do? we came back up and retested the the last res the last one of the last resistance, also the last high, uh, high low
market gave us two touches of this level, and then market dropped
but when, but when this, this is how i if i see that the market pulls back up to, in this case, fibonacci level 475, and i see, oh, okay, the market is giving me a little bit more to the upside, push to the upside
i i just analyze the charts and see, okay, what level can we potentially come back up on rita's right now
and what did the market do? so this is, this was a beautiful trade
take profit one is at 408, take profit to 366, and take profit three, three hundred and thirty
if this is the case, if we come back down to these levels, you'll see the market give you even more higher highs and lower lows and lower highs
uh, if you haven't already liked it, please go inside and do that, so you can help me grow the channel, so we can grow the channel together
and as i told you in the beginning, if you are new to my channel, i also have crypto trading for beginners, where i explain market structure, structure exactly how i take my trades
and you can also see the back testing live streams that i that i do have
and these are great supply and demand zones, trend lines, fibonacci
so you can just sit relax and just look at the just look at it
okay, we are about to hit my take profit soon on, um, buy bits
i did sell my, my, uh, bitcoin yesterday at twenty one thousand and forty
my take profit is at eighteen thousand, nineteen thousand eight hundred and forty
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus, up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and it's, it's, i know a lot of people get hyped when it comes to labor trading, but be very careful, because the brokers also have these, uh, these leverages, because they know that people over leverage
that's also why you have to be very careful, because what you can, if you can gain a lot, you can obviously also lose a lot of money
and if you want to be part of my beautiful community, community, you have the link also, uh, soon in the in the in the live chat, because lauren will give you the link to to that level
it's definitely the the best choices i did was to create that community
i will not look at this pair, baby, boy, not look at this pair
so what happened was that, um, what happened was that we came back up
we tested 3788, and that was the higher time frames fibonacci level
this is why i tell you, if i analyze the charts for you, you you need because you, you need to look at it yourself
but what we could have done is take another feed from 3760 back down to the low at 3574
just got hit on this fibonacci, uh? and the take profit to us 37 point, 3436
um, do we have another setup, maybe? hello carlos, how are ya? i see you
how are you? um, we just might see a quick pullback up to 3454, or potentially 346 to 7 67
if we have a little bit of a bigger pullback, we can drag the fibonacci up to 3638
and that could give us a 3516 retest, or a potential 3544 retest
but first of all, i would use the lower time frames fibonacci in case, uh, we only have a quick pullback right now
and that is also combined with the previous little lower low, just might turn into a new lower high
this is also something that we spoke i don't know exactly when it was, but the market did the exact same thing on the higher time frames, right? so we broke the support trend line
can you see how perfect this is? i mean, guys, i'm just so fascinated every time
i'm so thankful for god universe that gave me this gift, that gave me the opportunity to sit here doing what i do and share this with you guys
what happens even if the market broke inside of it? but can you see how perfect the market came back up and retested this support trend line? this is amazing
and another thing that we could have done is go down to the i mean, now we're looking at the break of the higher time frames
but i just want to show you how important it is for us to understand market structure
i'm always so fascinated about how the market is doing the same thing over and over and over again
can you see how perfectly this was? the fibonacci came up to the 619 percent? and what happened on the higher time frames? we took take profit
no one can come to me and tell me, not only this doesn't work, duh
if this doesn't work, what am i looking at? what am i looking at? if this doesn't work? trading is scam? no
okay, so let's see what where? what we're looking at? we take the connect the, uh, the previous hihat the previous resistance with the support
weekly chart, fibonacci from 4670, back down to low two thousand eight hundred and fifty eight
what happens? market pulls back up to the fibonacci levels one more time
we came back up, retested at fifty percent, at three thousand seven hundred and seventy five
if we have a, a, a little pullback right now, we can have a pullback up to potentially 3626, or potentially 3645
so what we can do is that we take another fibonacci now from 20 497, back down to 19980
if that is the case, why stop loss would be above the previous high, potentially around twenty thousand six hundred and fifty seven
and i would also have my my take profit at nineteen thousand and forty because that is the next, that is the other key level
so this is the setup right now on bitcoin on ethereum, we're gonna change it because in the beginning i had something else
so we don't have, yeah, okay, so 15 minutes chart take fibonacci from 1102 back down to, uh, 10 100
but i would also use key level 930, uh, if i want to have a bigger um trade
i will take my, i was put a settlement order right now on ethereum, so do you so you think we will go down from here? uh, yes, i do believe that
hey wesley, how are you? what do you have? disgusting names? why do you, why do you have your names on swedish like with this? disgusting
guys, don't this is so disrespectful, having disgusting names on youtube

you are not allowed to be here share the knowledge that i have with that
but if i see, doesn't matter what the name is, if it's not okay, it's not okay acting like that
why is this not working for me? why is this not working for me? now, this guy made me angry
let's see, i will have a cell limit order on ethereum, right now
if you don't follow andy, you can also go in and follow him, because he's an amazing trader, uh, himself
um, and don't forget that you can obviously also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video

so if you, if you think that you need to take that power back
and you don't have the responsibility over another person's life
my name is josh, and right now, the price of bitcoin is forming a brand new pattern in the short term that we need to pay attention to
and i'll be talking about that in just a moment, alongside ethereum later in this video, as always
first of all, just giving you a quick update on the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
but today's daily candle actually opens below yesterday's daily candle close
so even though we've seen some green during the trading day today in the stock market overall, if you're looking at the candle closes, we're actually sitting close to break even
stock market, specifically the nasdaq 100 index, not much has happened over the past one day
and once again, as i've been talking about over the past few days, we have an active bullish divergence on the 12 hour bitcoin chart in play
and so for anyone that might be new to the channel, what this means for bitcoin is basically, we're due to see reduced bearish momentum in the shorter term, which most likely means choppy, sideways price action for the next few days at least, potentially up to the next few weeks
and if bitcoin were to repeat what happened around a month ago at this previous bullish divergence on the 12 hour bitcoin charts in the coming days, we'll likely see the development of more defined support and resistance levels in some sort of shortterm price range, like what we saw back here
but other than that, nothing much has changed over the past few days for this 12hour bitcoin chart
so if we zoom right into the shorter term, taking a look at the one hour bitcoin charts, we can clearly see a head and shoulders pattern is forming right now in the bitcoin price, which is technically a bearish pattern
but keep in mind, at the time of recording this video, we have not seen a confirmed break below this level of support, at least just yet
and by the way, this level of support, also known as the neckline for the head and shoulders pattern, is coming in at around 198 k, approximately
and basically we need to see the bitcoin price break below that level, with ideally some sort of retest or spike of volume as we're breaking below that level
and we certainly need to see at least some sort of candle close, whether that's on the one hour chart or two hour charts, considering the fact that this head and shoulders pattern is visible on both the one hour and two hour bitcoin chance
and the larger the time frame, the more significant the candle close is
but of course, because this is not visible on the daily or the monthly chart, i obviously would not be waiting for a daily or monthly candle close to actually confirm a break below this level of support, considering this is only a smaller shortterm pattern
now, if we do end up seeing a confirmed break below around 198 k, then, technically speaking, that would activate the price target for this head and shoulders pattern
and just measuring out that technical price target, that would potentially take us down towards around 183 k, which, from the point of the break to that price target, would be around a seven to eight percent move to the downside, if it fully plays out with confirmation
on the 12 hour time frame, you can see that we're not talking about a massive bitcoin crash or anything
this is only a shorter term bitcoin movement within potentially a sideways price range of some sort according to this previous bullish divergence
it's now getting straight into the ethereum part of this video
this right here is the ethereum to yours dollar chart on the 12 hour time frame
and we still have this active bullish divergence in play, which once again, means reduced bearish momentum on the 12 hour chart
so moving forward over the next few days, i'd mostly be expecting choppy, sideways price action, as i've been talking about over the past few days
and the ethereum to yours dollar chart on the one hour time frame doesn't exactly have the same head and shoulders pattern as bitcoin has
but keep in mind, if bitcoin sees a pullback, would likely see a pullback for ethereum as well
and so an important level of support to watch for ethereum would be coming in at around a thousand dollars per ethereum
and if you're looking at the ethereum versus bitcoin charts on the weekly time frame, nothing much has happened over the past few days
but as of right now, ethereum versus bitcoin is still sitting above this important uploading line of support, which is coming in at around 0049 bitcoin per ethereum
and apart from that, pretty much everything that i said over the past two days for bitcoin ethereum and ethereum vs bitcoin, or the larger time frames, talking about the daily the weekly charts, that is all still valid information as of right now
once again, at the last two videos here on the channel, when i'm talking about the larger time frames
so rather than repeating that information over and over again every day, which would be wasting the subscribers time, i'll simply just continue to update on everything that is new, everything that is changing on these charts
and so if you are new to this channel, definitely go back and watch one of my last two videos here on the channel
also, just a reminder that in only four and a half days from now, the world series of trading begins, which is the biggest trading competition in the world
and this year there's a total price pool of up to 8 million us
so if you want to potentially grab yourself a share in that 8 million prize pool, make sure to join the crypto world team in this competition
because, of course, if we place well as a team, then just by being a team member, you can actually grab yourself a share in that massive prize pool
and the more members we have in our team, the more likely we'll place well in the competition
and by the way, you can find a link to all of this, where you can join my team if you want to, in the description down below and in the pinned comments
in fact, it'll be the first link in the description and in the pinned comment
but i want to make it clear that this is not for complete beginners out there
there is risk when it comes to trading crypto, so obviously it is important to understand the risks involved
but anyway, this was just a quick bitcoin and ethereum update video today because nothing much has happened over the past one day
but even though nothing much has happened over the past one day, you can find out how to maximize your profits in crypto by checking out this video popping up right here
and this video actually shows you how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed it, and i'll see you all in the next video
so the current bitcoin price is twenty one thousand two hundred and eighty four dollars
uh, as you can see, there are alt queens that are popping across the board
and as is common knowledge, you know, you get some of the biggest moves in these, uh, barrier they call them, like a bear rally
and that's kind of what we're seeing over here on the bitcoin price
let's see, from the wick of the bottom to current price, it's already rallied about 21 22
so i've brought out the long term logarithmic regression curve for bitcoin, something that i haven't shown for quite some time
essentially, this is, uh, of course, mapped out the majority of the lows for bitcoin throughout, as well as the majority of the highs
and any of you can get this, you just type in on your trading view, longterm regression chart for bitcoin under your indicators, and it should pop up over there
so you can see, the only times that we've really left these bottom sides are in the depths of the previous bear markets
and anytime that you do that, for longterm investors, considered a good time to be accumulating
if your time horizon is going to be like michael sailors for many years, then this could be a good time to be accumulating bitcoin
so what i'm doing at the moment is i'm more looking at as a trader, at the current markets, as mentioned before, just because of the macroeconomic environment that we're currently in
i know there will always be markets to trade, so there's no need to rush
and essentially we have a, if you have a look at this chart over here, the td sequential, which is a trading system developed by someone named uh tom the mark, and you have what's called the setup trend line over here
we have outlined this area before, which is an area of support, which also seems to line up with that td sequential support line over there
it's coming in at twelve thousand three hundred and sixty dollars
so we'll leave this, this line over here, and we'll revisit it in the future
i'll lock it there, even we'll see how this plays out over the next coming, uh, weeks to months
it created the sort of deviation at the top over there, and it's been coming down ever since
but we do have an area that was previous resistance, which now may be flipping into support
so i want to see, also, over the next few weeks, how is it going to react at this level, 10376
we also have the stock market, which is going to be opening today
and i said that i anticipate there could be a potential for some sort of a bounce up to set the next lower high
and then ultimately, i do still expect these levels of 247 to be retested
but this will have to play out over a couple of days, because i am on a weekly chart
okay, this is the the more important things that i want to focus a little bit more time on
i did mention on the previous show, i said, look, you have your low range coming in at about 18 000, where the lows were set in
and if you expand the chart over here, then you have your top of the range, which is coming in at 22 879
this is also important, because if you look at this yellow marking over here, this is essentially where the last, where the next uh area has to be cleared to set a higher high
so if price can start to get back above these levels over here and close a couple of four hour candles above the range high, you would confirm a new higher high
so as the title suggests, is this a short squeeze? well, that depends
i think, if price does start to clear these sort of levels over here, then possibly we could be getting a real short squeeze
i know that if i i'll be entering the majority of my shorts as close to the invalidation level as possible, so within this region
and if price starts to close above that, i'll, of course, i'll stop out right above there
then i think there could be a short squeeze that's on the table
but at the moment, the funding rates are positive, which means that it's less likely to be the case there
it means there are more people that are currently taking leverage long positions then there are leverage short so we said, what are we doing? we're playing this level to level
if you clear and you start to close a couple of candles above the midrange over there, then you could start to look for longs
that's a very shortterm trader, right? if you're looking at the 15minute, 30minute chart, maybe even an hourly chart, then great
you can go along, target this area over here, clear that level, and then start to long towards the 25 000 as your next area of interest
as i've mentioned to you before, i don't ever counter trade the trend
as long as we are below this area over here, the trend remains down
so until proven otherwise, which means the closer you get to invalidation, the better your opportunity to short
so anywhere within this zone over here is a shorting opportunity, the way i see it, no matter what your emotions are saying, which i know a lot of people are getting very emotional
i can already see it on twitter, which is why i did put out a tweet thread trying to, uh, basically talk you through my thinking process when entering these short trades
but i will also try and touch on it briefly, quickly, in the stream
so in essence, what i said is that when i take a short trade, this is the way that i look at it
this is bnb, so i'm sure you all want to update on that anyway
and then i want to take a look at this from a larger perspective
i'll put it on four is this parabolic, in reverse parabolic trend line over here
so you'll notice, if i had to zoom in on that, that we are still, it's still working
and would you have a look at that? the invalidation level comes up right against that, uh, parabolic trend line over there, the reverse parabolic
so going back onto a four hour let's take a closer look at everything
what i said on twitter was, when i enter these trades, right? remember the first time when i outlined this trade? well, firstly, we we entered way higher, right? we entered at the top over here, coming near the 300 region
for those of you that missed out and you weren't able to, uh, enter the top, and then the first take profit level, there may be another opportunity where you can get in
but for some of those guys that got in later, let's just assume you only started to see this chart after i'd made that video
then you would essentially be looking to how price is reacting along the 21 ema on the four hour chart
and you'll be looking to enter into short positions based off of a rejection of that
so the way that i would enter is usually into a couple of different phases
i'll take a very, very small entry off of that over there and look at where price went
at one stage, i think i was up something like 25 or 30 percent
then i get more aggressive as i approach the next level of interest, which is the underside resistance that's forming over here
but if it's 10 to 20 entered here, maybe you enter another 30 in this region over here
and then i leave the last and final part of my account, the biggest amount that i want to enter, i'll leave for as close to the invalidation as possible
if price gets back above this level and starts to close there, my short trade is invalidated
so i would leave the last 50 percent for this region over here, and i would go with higher leverage in that region
so what does that mean? the reason that i do that is because, let's say price goes against me, price would rise
let's say your stops are above this parabolic, uh trend line that i've drawn, and that comes in at 18 percent, then you are losing very, very little in your account
if you want a hard stop straight above this trend line, and you want to enter with 50 of your account on high leverage, let's say that's your decision
that's what you want to do, and you enter right there one tick before that's a 03 move
so your invalidation is extremely, extremely close before getting top down
if you're the type of trader that doesn't want to have any sort of drawdown, then you're probably better off being a breakout trader, which is an entirely different strategy, and not one that i personally use
so in essence, has anything changed for me? no, nothing's changed
if anything, i'll just be looking to, uh ladder in on more aggressive coming into this area over here
and underside in validation, i'd be looking to add into my position
if i'm wrong, what would this look like? okay, this is how i'd imagine it would play out
let's say i'm deciding i want a short, okay? and i've gone into the short
price gets above over here, sets a new higher high in relation to this area, at 237
then what happens next? of course, we have to set in the next higher low
and for that to happen, price will need to come down, right? it may not break the lows, but it will probably test somewhere around there
bear in mind, i sold all my, all my crypto when bitcoin was at 47 000
if i want to be really conservative, i'd wait for that to play out, set a higher low, then set the next higher high, and only by the following higher low over there
the market is not going anywhere the market's going to be at tomorrow, next year, 10 years from now
pretty much as long as financial markets exist, the market will be around
so my advice to those who are fomoing and getting very, very highly strung and stressed out by these moves is, just take a breather, just relax
we stuck in this range on bitcoin, low the range, low range, high, mid range
uh, you'll see my social medias are over there as well as the bibet show
so for the bible referral link, if you do want to follow along with the trades, there is a bybert link over there
i'll try and expand on, uh, basically what i'm trying to teach over here

it needed a nice refresh of everything because i've got a huge amount of tabs open
i did press resume settings, and it seems like i got the same settings from yesterday on the live stream
i've been talking here for 10 minutes, and, yeah, the microphone wasn't on
i'm just talking and talking without um speaking louder says mark dutch
oh, my goodness, with the computer not working well now, not the microphone, not putting it on
i'm gonna say the exact same thing that i did say in the beginning, okay, which is, bitcoin now hitting a major resistance zone, which is, you know, the, uh, this resistance from this ascending channel, as you can see
and pretty funny, i've been over five minutes, actually, over five minutes
like i said, you know, the possibilities, you know, i'm looking for these resistance levels, looking for those levels for bitcoin to get rejected
because is this a good shorting opportunity, in my opinion, it is right now because we're hitting a resistance zone
we could get a little bit more volatility and have a correction
but also, you know, people are very, very bullish at the moment
are we going to actually continue to the upside? is this a good level to long? well, not really, because, you know, you should have been longing, you know, all of this range
right at this moment is not the best moment to long, in my opinion, because you're at the very, very top, okay, of this, of this um, of this uptrend
so what if we do get that breakout? okay, most importantly, where could the bitcoin price stop? where could we get that rejection? where could we get a consolidation, a reaction in the price action so we can take an opportunity trade? well, i can see this major daily level
this is something that i was just talking about right when i was in silent, which is absolutely crazy
um, if i zoom out, like i said, december of 2020, we have major daily closes and opens
as you can see, okay, these levels have been very much respected
if i go to the one hourly chart, fast forward, after two years, you can see that these levels have been pretty much, um, respected
we had massive, massive downtrend here, as you can see, uh, in june, all right, second week of june, we were going absolutely crazy here to the downside, actually slicing through these major levels
broke the second daily level and got beautiful rejection at this range
so this zone here that has been respected two times, this is the 22 800 range
if the price of bitcoin goes up there, which, i mean, it's not 100, but we should be getting some kind of reaction
of course, all depending on the power of the potential pump that can happen
but i am not, you know, speculating that we are going to go up there
um, you know, i'm just saying, if we do go up there, this is a major zone that i would be interested in and and having a quick, short day trades
it might take a couple of a couple of days to have that correction here
um, like i said, we are hitting the higher, high trend line, as you can see
has this been a solid breakout? well, we haven't seen too much volume here
it is true that we are above the biggest point of control at this moment
this is probably not going to be a successful breakout, and we are going to get that correction at this moment
it looks like it is getting exhausted this kind of ascending channel
and looks like that we are looking for that potential correction here
so only if you have good risk management, the gains can be pretty good here on a potential short
um, you've got the bitcoin dominance, bitcoin dominance here, breaking out from this descending triangle that happened in may, massive breakout
we were very much expecting a kind of rejection, a consolidation, or a rejection from this major level on the bitcoin dominance, to see a relief rally on all coins, especially bitcoin, does pump
now what is happening right now is that the bitcoin dominance is hitting a major support zone
we broke this major pattern, and we are getting the reaction of this resistance turning into support
we got this resistance right there from this wave, acting as support right now
so the probabilities here, and actually the bitcoin dominance continuing to the upside, is just very, very high to come back up and retest this zone and potentially break it
now, this is not going to be good news for all coins, of course
so you know, i think the moment to long those altcoins, the moment you should have longed those altcoins, was at this bitcoin dominance major resistance
okay? and all coins did pretty well after the 13th of june, right when we did have this major drop
this is when we saw the altcoins the last few days, getting that relief rally, right? we have been seeing some altcoins popping
you know, this is the, these are the best two charts, in my opinion, two take a look at, you know, major altcoin longs or shorts
dxy is also very, very important for me to see if we it is good
when the dxy is looking bearish, of course, then you can see, um, bitcoin having a higher probability, all right? and being bullish
you need, you need to take a look at bitcoin, see if bitcoin is bullish or bearish
and then bitcoin dominance, because the bitcoin dominance is the bit
if the bitcoin dominance does look like we are going to get a big, major bounce here on the bitcoin dominance, it might take a few days
you might get a little bit of a momentum, just like we did here, and then continue back up
guys, we've broken this major pattern on the bitcoin dominance
beautiful rejection here from this zone, as you can see right there
what is happening right there, right now is that we're getting supported from lower high trend line and also this major resistance zone, guys
so yeah, if this does look like it's going to go up, bitcoin dominance goes up, mainly, all coins go down
okay, maybe if bitcoin does have a little bit of bullish momentum, it might save some altcoins
but if bitcoin goes down and bitcoin dominance goes up, all coins will bleed again, guys
so anyway, let me just go through the comment section right away
we try and, you know, looking, look for trading opportunities
and, you know, risk just a tiny bit of your portfolio, of your portfolio, of your capital, only risk one to two, three percent is even a little bit too much
i know most of you watching here risk much more than that, okay, from your trading, uh, account
i've done that for many, many years, and, um, yeah, it's not that, it's not ideal
i'm not making hundreds of thousands, or even tens of thousands
okay, uh, i, you know, i, i'm looking for that wage at the end of, you know, of the of the month
if you have an account of 50 000, you should be risking about 500, 1 000 per trade
i know many of you that have, i'm sure that have a couple of thousand, uh, dollars in your trading account
if you have five thousand, if you have five thousand dollars in your trading account and you are in a trade risking 500 to 1 000, it's too much, um, in my personal opinion
we did get a beautiful rejection here on the dxy from this major trend line, okay, that we have been talking about, the trend line here, from these higher lows
we're kind of creating a a double top scenario with some bearish divergence
so are we going to see a little bit of of calling off on the dxy? it might take a few days
we might see a little bit of more momentum to the upside, but overall, i think we are going to be heading down in the next coming months
now, you can see here also dxy getting that, you know, major, major rejection, big consolidation
you know, you could, you could assume that the price was going to get a major rejection from the zone and continue back down
this is why we've also been seeing some bullishness on bitcoin, thanks to this kind of move to the downside from the dxy
let's connect with the community and take a look at some altcoins
waves says, um, waves is a pretty cool project, but there is something about waves that i i, you know, i didn't like this move
okay? when a project, when an asset that does this, it's a pumping dump, right? pumping dump
this is not, i don't know why this happened, but it's a little bit fishy
it's been here for many, many years, and, um, it's basically created a kind of a double bottom scenario right now
so the chances on on waves actually continuing to the upside, i think it's, it's, they're very, very high, very, very high
you know, you've got a beautiful double bottom right there on waves, major consolidation
and now it's just absolutely skyrocketing um [Music] to the potential levels where we could get waves
i focus more on bitcoin, you know, that maybe ethereum, because these all coins are very, very unpredictable movements to the upside, into the downside
they do not respect very much support and resistance levels, highly manipulated
so major level here where we could get, could get that um reaction on waves
we've got 50 right over here from this major drop, which is actually where we do have resistance and support bounces here on the chart
as you can see, what level is this, this is the seven dollar eighty cents
seven dollar eighty cent, seven dollar ninety cents, approximately, uh, 785, to be more exact, is a big, big zone where the price of waves could get a potential rejection
uh, i would wait for a con small consolidation, a little bit, a few candlesticks of over of a reaction, to potentially jump on a trade, because you do not want to get, you do not want to short a huge, massive pump, right? the same you don't want to long a big, aggressive falling knife, right? a big, massive dump
so i would wait for a little bit of a reaction, okay, to see how we react at that level
once we are fight having some hourly candles, trying to break the zone, then this is the moment you want to take that decision
are you going to risk some of your capital to take that shorting opportunity? big zone here on waves
but you could have assumed that, potentially you could have had this bullish momentum here with this double bottom
so, yeah, let's take a look here at the, uh, the comment section
you do have the best bonus down below, which is up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus
okay, so you do not pay fees for 30 days, right? this is looking pretty good, guys, for a potential shorting opportunity
i might risk some of a small percentage of my capital um to enter a short position here
so, um, i'm going to enter in a small shorting opportunity right there
um, if we start pumping a little bit crazy on above this range, i will be closing my stop loss here on the live stream, uh, closing my position
is shiba inu looking good for a short? i mean, right now, waves is getting that small reaction to that 382, major fib level, major fib level here, getting that reaction
right now, we could see a little bit of a of an aggressive pullback on waves, just hitting that, uh, 382 fibonacci level
we could be getting a pretty decent pullback here on on waves
it's actually at the same level here where we do have a resistance consolidation, as you can see
so you have that price action to the upside, major consolidation at the point 236, and you also have it here, right there
of course, if you are shorting this, remember, you are shorting a major, big pump
this is a little bit risky, okay? with the volatility from these old coins, you know, you can get stopped out in seconds
but it does look like wave could have a pretty decent correction here and maybe continue back up
uh? but yeah, it looks like it is screaming for a correction, especially if bitcoin does start correcting right now, then, um, yeah, we will be seeing those, those altcoins correcting also, especially looking at the bitcoin dominance, ready for pumpy action
bitcoin dominance, after this huge correction, it looks like it is ready for some pumpy action
i would be surprised if we do break this support on the bitcoin dominance
then, you know, it looks like we could be heading much lower on the bitcoin dominance
this has potentially been a failed breakout, not managing to get above the last lower high from this pattern, which is crucial for a confirmed breakout
and if it does come lower, which i do not think it's gonna, is gonna be the case
so let's take a look at shiba inu right now, here for someone in the comment section
i'm going to explain right away why this could be a shorting level on shiba inu
we actually got insanely supported from the large consolidation that we did have back in july, august
so i think that, you know, most of the people, you know, don't, don't want, okay, especially the ones that have been buying at this level, unless you have been selling here aggressively
um, they do not want the price of shiva inu to drop below the summer uh 2021 area
we are reacting at this level, one bounce here, one bounce there
you're aren't cheaper, you know, you know, is this a major shorting opportunity? of course
we want to short those kind of pumps and exhaustions and reactions at big resistance levels
we created a kind of a descending triangle right there, right where you are creating these lower highs right there
you've got a bit of volatility, but the four hourly consolidation is at this level
so this is the strong level, not this one, this one right over here
and where the price consolidate is where you do have the base, where you do have a strong, respected level
i would wait for the next coming hours to see how we react at this level
if you start making this kind of consolidation, this kind of reaction at this level, you can perfectly assume that this is going to come back down, okay? and i would say at least to that 618 level from the pump, where it's always a good take profit area for me
all right? from the big, massive pump right there, you know, this 618, a little bit of more confluence, not only fibonacci level right over here
so even above the 618, just at the 50, in between 50 618, it would be a good zone
okay, if we do get that reaction here on shiba inu at these levels, at these current levels, next coming hours, because this could actually start doing this, right? this could still continue back up
if you're doing that, then this zone here will very, very likely turn into some pretty nice support
we've got the red horizontal line here giving us the strongest point of control from the volume traded the last two months
and what we can see here is, you know, the red horizontal line is giving us that big support level, that big base here
look at this, where we have been having major, major bounces on shiba inu
so if we do not get rejected from this zone and start pumping like crazy, this would be the area number two to actually, you know, risk a shorting opportunity, the biggest point of control, which is the, uh, the point zero, zero, zero, zero, one one here
one, one, six, seven here on chiba, you know, big, big zone where the price could get rejection
and you could have very, very good opportunities, guys, if you are quick on the chart, getting in, getting out
okay, there are some big, big zones here where you are very likely going to get those bounces
if you shorting here, you are fighting a big, aggressive pump
do you want to do that? absolutely not the same as long in a big, major dump
you do not want to do that, because you don't really know, you know, if it's going to stop there
but this is still very aggressive, so we do have that aggressive move up
you could fight here, a potential short without waiting for the consolidation, because what usually happens when you do hit these big, major zones is that you wick it and you dump it, and you don't get a large consolidation
but this does look like that this level could get that big, big resistance
um looking at hershey, but, you know, on the four hourly, and definitely you could, you know, make some huge gains with this price action to the downside, at least, from level to level, right? you're looking to trade level to level for those gains
big, big, big level here on shiva inu, and you are looking to trade level to level
um, if we do consolidate here in the next coming hours, it might be a good shorting opportunity
uh, it's just nice, easy to understand technical analysis, not too complicated, not taking, you know, too much indicators on vpvr, level to level levels that are respected on the chart
and we can prove that where we could potentially find those opportunities guys to make some gains
um, soul bottom price is twenty dollars, still possible for solana? um, price, twenty dollars still possible for solana, absolutely
shiba inu is the future? well, um, yeah, if you think so, i think bitcoin is the future
i think i had gmt here ready also to take a look at, because it is hitting a major resistance right now
uh, gmt, where we do have the resistance trend line here from these lower highs, as you can see right over here, we're just about hitting this level
so the trend is still pretty aggressive to the downside here on um
now, something very similar to the crypto that we've just taken a look at
okay? we are getting a reaction from this support turning into resistance
we've got the lower high trend line here, also from these lower highs, as you can see
so it's a major zone where the price could have a leg down right now
but what if we do get that volatility? what if we do get a leg up here? it is very, very likely that we will be getting rejected from this strong level
what level? the exact one dollar? the one dollar level where we do have the largest consolidation here, the biggest spike on the vpvr um
okay, from this consolidation drop, we are hitting the 618 right now
a lot of, a lot of possibilities on gmt, getting a, a, a retracement from this range, getting resistance right now and actually coming back down
i know there's a lot of people screaming that bottom is in now
i actually want to ask something, okay, here on the community
uh, i just wanted to point out here on gmt, before i asked the question, if gmt does manage to spike up here in the next coming hours, this is a very, very strong level where it can get rejected, the one dollar range
we will be getting a bunch of liquidity from this high, big spike on the vpvr
and very likely just gaining these highs to correct, to actually correct
i would be more interested in shorting if we do pump here, assuring this range for a correction on gmt
and if we take a look at the next major fib level to take a look at would be this spike over here to the lows
from this one to this one, you got the six one eight, major level
even better one is the 618 here, where we have the biggest point of control that would give you the highest probability trade right there
uh, in my opinion, that one dollar range, very, very high probability
okay, people that have been looking at the live stream for the next, you know, 10 minutes, absolutely destroy that like button here, guys, for the algorithm
unless i want to ask you guys it, will bitcoin, will bitcoin go to 12k? uh, no
what can i ask the community? is the bottom in? is the bottom in for bitcoin? um, let me ask the community, because i am seeing a lot of influences a lot of people, you know, analysts
and, you know, bottom is in this indicators, as always shown at the bottom
what do you guys think is bottom in for bitcoin? let me know right away
waves has been having, it has been having some crazy bullish momentum
but like i said, we are hitting a pretty, uh, strong resistance level
we are hitting the 382 from this drop right now, getting that kind of reaction here, as you can see, um, stay cautious
best level here on on on waves, to short would be the 50 fibonacci from this drop
let's just zoom in on the chart on night on um on waves right now
let me just get this fib level at exact range right over here, the point 23
if it does come down, a level where we could bounce on on waves is the 590, because we've got consolidations there
it is the fibonacci level from the highs to the lows, getting respected from range to range
there are some major opportunities there to, um, to make some gains on waves
um, andy is always handsome, even though he doesn't take a shower
i look that dirty, does can you really notice it? i haven't had the shower for the last couple of weeks
i also think that how long waves will pump up to which level? well, we already getting a big resistance level
you know, it's all up to you we don't really know where it can go up to
and we are actually, you know, i think the rejection here on waves all the way down to 590, which is the point, two, three, six, uh? and also big consolidation here here on waves
so that, you know, if we do correct down to this range, you could get a bounce from this level
um, even better would be the 50 fibonacci at the 790 from this major drop on waves
we're looking, i'm looking always for the highest probability trades, of course
and, um, you know, this would be insanely highly probable if we do hit that 50 percent fibonacci retracement from this major drop
and it's also the 50 percent fibonacci from this major drop of retracement
if you are shorting fifty percent, if you do reach that seven dollar ninety cents on waves, you're shorting, you know, you you take profits from zones, okay, where you could get that big bounce
so if you do get that leg up and short this, you know, it's definitely a major level, the seven dollar range
so from seven dollar ninety to seven dollar to seven dollar area is a potential, quick, quick trade there
so lower is coming? is lower coming? are we going to lower levels for bitcoin? uh, solana
we've actually broke this resistance trend line from these aggressive low highs
if i zoom out on the full hourly chart, it looks pretty, pretty good
we created a pretty nice double bottom right there, and breaking major resistance zones
okay, just about four or five days ago, getting that big, big resistance
on the one hourly, you did get a small reaction, you can see it right there
but that was a beautiful shorting opportunity on, uh, on solana
so what other what are the trades now for solana? if we take a look at the four hourly? um, major levels of rejection on solana
so you might think, okay, we are bullish, shall we long? well, you are
if you are long in here on solana, you're you're longing at the very top of the trend
an aggressive correction could happen if we start, if we continue pumping on solana
the 40, 40 41 area, i think, is a very, very strong level here
you do have a pretty nice spike on the vpvr also, as you can see on the chart
so you do have these strongest mountains on the vpvr right now
so this one right over here will very, very likely get some kind of reaction here and get rejected, potentially to continue back up, but breaking the 35 dollars
this isn't, this could easily be a fake outcome continue back down
and then once you come down, you could be looking for those bounces
i would be more interested in shorting the 40 range, or actually long in here the the pullback, if we do continue back up right now
um, to hit that forty dollars, we start consolidating here a little bit, this will be looking dangerous
once it comes down, then you could be looking for that, you know, potential higher, low continuation to the upside
okay? these ascending channels are usually, you know, bearish, uh, descending channels are usually bullish
can this absolutely break out from this zone? absolutely, guys
i think highest probability trade here on bitcoin would be having that leg up to that 227 228
we could get that big, big, uh, rejection if we do consolate at this level
uh, i would be very much interested in shorting bitcoin it does have that leg up to 227 228, and consolidate at that region
is not off the table for later on this year? um, 10k, yeah, about 12k? 12k is my kind of extremely bearish
if we go to 12k, of course, we can whip down to, um, um, we can wick down down to, uh, 10k levels
i just want to take a look at, uh, the bitcoin price here on the weekly and show you on the threeday chart, and just show you guys how, you know, it's a very, very strong level
okay? i'm not sure if if we hit 12k, we could get that volatility and hit 10k
you know, it's 50, almost 50, of bitcoins value from this moment
so it's, we can't expect those bigger relief rallies, of course
but 12k, you know, i think everybody wants to buy bitcoin at 10k levels
everybody wants to buy, everybody wants bitcoin at 12k, uh, 10k, 12k
is it gonna come? you know, i'm already buying up, because i know how this, this game works, you know
when i see this, you know, it's like over here when you see too many, you know, the laser eyes
i should have sold some more of my portfolio, but, um, that's when you need to be really, really cautious
too much people entering the crypto space wanting to get rich
a lot of influencers, you know, talking about, you know, including myself
you know, 100k will be coming, you know, before the end of the year
uh, when you are hitting, you know, these crazy prizes, hitting all time high in november you know, this is it, this is it
but on the other side, on the bearish side, where a lot of people are talking about 10k levels in the next coming months, i do see a little bit of sideways action, bearish momentum
but you know what? if we do not hit 12k, what if we don't hit 10k? i will be leaving some dollars on the sidelines to buy up at 10k
it will, it will be very, very funny if, you know, we actually don't successfully break down 19k, hitting 17k, hitting 16k, with a little bit of volatility, having that kind of accumulation momentum kind of scenario right for the next coming months, and then start pumping in mid 2023, and then come back down again
okay? with everybody thinking that we are going to go lower and create like, a massive, big double bottom scenario and start pumping like crazy in 2024 and and people actually, you know, waiting for that 12k level
this is why i will be dollar cost averaging, you know, in between these price levels for the next coming months
um, and i think, you know, a lot of people are gonna miss out
can i suggest any, uh, any resistance? let's take a look at matic network
why not? let's take a look at matic uh, mark dutch, thank you very much for joining the live stream
moderators, always giving massive, massive support to the channel
this is, uh, no doubt in my mind that this is going to do well
okay? it will be a survivor, such as many other layer twos, such as, you know, if you want very, very high risk, high rewards
um, you want to check out some other layer twos, such as metis
and this is the moment you want to be bullish when a price asset
matic network has hit one of the strongest levels here on the point of control
as you can see, big, big consolidation we had in march, april, may of 2021
okay, not may, may absolutely skyrocketed, but big consolidation
it for two months, big spike on the vpbr, this is why we are getting this reaction
this is why this is holding the range, this level is holding for formatic
and you are asking me, you know, what is a good level of res to short? right? i'm not going to give you, i'm not going to tell you where to short, but i can tell you what big resistance we do how thematic um and i think it's, you know, pretty pretty simple here
you know, we've got this low area that we did create in the summer of 2021, in july, the ultimate low
um, getting that consolidation at this level, if we do, simatic, very likely, coming up to this range, we are potentially going to get rejected from this zone
okay? if you do start getting that consolidation at this range, uh, you are potentially going to get rejected to retest the lows, automatic
like i said, in a bear market, you very likely are going to retest the lows several, several times
you do retest the load several, several times, because you want to kind of sideways action
of course, you could get big relief pumps, but only to come back down and retest the lows
you kind of get double bottom, triple bottoms a lot, okay? and large consolidations in a boring bear market
okay, especially at the very, very end of a potential major trend
so, uh, asking yourself, a good resistance zone to short is? i think it's a, you know, pretty smart, pretty aggressive um trend to the downside
and looking at the last couple of weeks on matic, we can see, um, you know, this spike on the vpbr is because of this volume was created
so, [Music] the value area low from this level, is very, very likely going to get some kind of rejection if matic does manage to come up all the way up here to this 57 range
it's a major zone where we could get that first rejection on matic
[Music], yeah, a big zone here on matic would be in between 50 percent, uh, 50 cents, sorry, and 55 cents
from this drop over here, you've got this spike and this spike
if you do get up here to that 5358 zone, you are very likely going to get this area, a consolidation and a potential rejection on matic
big spike on the vpvr level, valley area low, big support level that will be turning lightly into resistance
of course, this is if bitcoin doesn't continue to the downside right now, because if bitcoin rolls down, we've got the bitcoin dominance pumping
matic probably won't even reach this level, but it would be the highest probability zone that would be
that would be a zone where i would be looking for shorting opportunities
can you hear me? um, is the voice? okay, i'm just gonna check here with my mods
you got that right? let me just double check here that i'm in the stream still and my what you yeah, you can hear me
and i don't think it explain why we are hitting this resistance from this ascending channel
i don't see this as a legit breakout from this big vpvr level
it does look like a kind of a liquidity grab from these highs
and we could have a little bit of a corrective move here, at least, to retest the support of this ascending channel, which would be around about the 203, 205 k levels
i do see a potential corrective move here on bitcoin to retest this vpvr zone
what is the dxy doing? is the dxy dixwise having a little bit of a pump right now? um, uh, please
okay, guys, thanks for confirming, because i had one someone here in the comment section that he couldn't hear me
but something that i wanted to point out that on primex bt, you get seven percent added to your deposit
okay? it's one of my favorites to trade other markets such as oil, natural gas
and, um, [Music], yeah, you get seven percent added to your deposit
if you use my link in the description, okay, and bitcoin sends 50 as the promotion code, up to 7 000, you get 7 added to your deposit on primax bt
i'll probably, you know, wait for a consolidation at this range
um, at what price did he shorted? my entry was at about 215, approximately 215
if we do get a little bit of more pump the action, and do get a reaction at this level, okay? if we do get multiple failed attempts, then i think i will be adding to my position, um, because this is a, you know, this we are hitting resistance levels
i don't see this as a solid breakout, just a little leg up, and we could potentially correct from the zone also
like i said, you know, this is kind of, you know, smart money doesn't buy at this kind in an ascending channel at the resistance zone, unless there's a big, massive, you know what? whatever happens, and you do get those big, massive pumps, but this is why you should be having, you know, tight stop losses, all right, stop losses at this range so you, you know, you don't, you don't, you are protected, basically, just in case you do get a big, massive, volatile move
his cells just going down, though, because celsius did have a pretty aggressive pump the last couple of days
if you do have some, you know, uh, some crypto in celsius for for apis
if you are bullish on a project like this, you, um, you know, this is the level
this is, these are the levels that you want to buy, basically
of course, not not telling you to buy, but this, if you are bullish on jasmine, yeah, these are the levels you want to want to scoop up some jasmine
maybe it looks like it's, it's, um, having a nice flat level here
and you could get, um, some massive bumpy speculation on jasmine
you got a double bottom, you got a double bottom inside of a double bottom, right there
i do not trade almost any altcoins, just aetherium maybe, and some some of the large capitalizations
let's take a look at, um, what are the crypt i was going to take a look at wrecked
you mean, yeah, they have been locking, uh, they have been blocking the transactions
jasmine is a cryptocurrency i haven't done much, uh, jasmine coin
i haven't done any research whatsoever on this cryptocurrency
i think it is on and by bit, actually, i think you can trade this on by bit jasmine
trend line is going to break if it holds, if it, if it breaks, short
uh, crow has gone absolutely, you know, insanely to the downside
okay, uh, i think they got a 20year contract for the la arena where the lakers play
we can zoom in here on the the four hourly chart, and it is very, very possible that we do actually come at least to round about the 16 here
i think we are going to have that potential lego, all depending on what bitcoin does
if bitcoin goes down, we were probably just going to go and do a little bit more sideways action
but it will recover at some point, in my opinion, to that 15 cent level
you know, this is the moment, really, just a couple of days ago, that you need to decide, you know, is this going to get this reversal point where we're creating higher lows on the rsi, lower lows on the on the price action? you need to think to yourself, right? this is just about to get that bounce
but anyway, i do see crow getting a larger recovery, uh, very likely in the coming weeks
um, especially if bitcoin does behave, bitcoin needs to behave, though
if i do see bitcoin coming down in the next coming days, i think it's just going to be, you know, the next coin hours and days
um, we are going to create a higher low successfully and continue back up, but then to continue back down
i do see a larger relief rally on bitcoin in the coming weeks and a lot of sideways action
do you think if btc retest the channel though, can break its ascending channel? uh, before? do you think if bitcoin test retested, uh, the channel, so can break its ascending channel before? uh, what? ascending channel on solana? um, what a sending channel? i'm not sure
why not from, uh, frantisek, let's take a look at chain link right? why not? um, right
something curious that i want to, you know, let's zoom out to see where we are
uh, well, no, we leave them because they're very, they're getting very much respected
i'm gonna go through this major support level right now on chain link
all right, just to see where we at right now with chain link, we need to zoom out to see where we at we actually lost this low level
um, does this mean we're going to continue back down? well, well, we have retested the range, as you can see from the lows created on on december, also lows from september broken down, retested
now, are we going to create a kind of a double bottom on chain link? this is something that we're going to analyze here, zooming in on the price action
but what i want to show you most importantly is that we did have a big consolidation on chain link back in june, from june of 2019 all the way to june of 2020
what happened inside of this consolidation, where there was huge amount of volume, you know, created a huge amount of money traded at these levels? it started, you know, all the way as low as 150 cents and as high as five dollars
if i extend this box, this is exactly where the price action has kind of stopped, right hitting that five dollar 490, uh, approximately here on chain link
the lows, big value area, high from the volume traded in 2019 and 2020
this is why you are getting this kind of bounce from this range
so if we zoom in on chain link, saying, we do know that this five dollar area is extremely, extremely strong support
so what has happened right now? also, you did have this very, very well respected trend line bouncing every single time from the second touch here
as you can see, three, four dipping below here, but managing to to, to hold and consolidate
um, five bounces, and you get that sixth bounce here, as you can see
so you can expect chain link to get a little bit of more price momentum to the upside
i do think that, you know, the this five dollar area, high four dollar range, could be the lows for chain link
i would just, i would say that we are close to it, and we are going to see a lot of sideways action on jlink
you know, we have huge level here on the vpvr in between 150 and five dollars
and i think, you know, if we do dip below five dollars, it won't be for long
it's just a very solid level that, you know, that five dollar level is very, very solid
looking at the vp vr, we had over a year here of consolidation, the resistance being that five dollar range
if bitcoin does drop below nineteen thousand dollars, uh, in the next coming, you know, couple of, you know, i'm not sure when it's going to be out, but if it does drop below nineteen thousand dollars, then, of course, chain link will be dipping below five dollars, but not going to one dollar, one dollar fifty
you know, if i see chain link at four dollars, i will be adding up to my, to my, um, chain link portfolio, even though i have an insane bag pressed popcorn for um, bottom is in, says, yeah, this is that
we have a lot of influences, a lot of analysts as well, saying that the bottom is in for bitcoin, you know, with all of these onchain data, bottom indicators, right where we are at extreme oversaw territory fear and greed index is, you know, at ultimate low levels
okay? if we take a look at the last, you know, five years, i think, approximately from 2018 or years, um, fear and greed index is at ultimate low levels
okay? we haven't been, hardly ever at these levels since 2018
um, we got the c19 event here, of course, we went at extreme, extreme fear, and we were there for, um, a few weeks, until we actually had a massive recovery
so we have some different indicators of people, you know, bottom is in
we can see the miners, i think, miners, bitcoin miners are not selling bitcoin
this is also a small sign that you could see, you know, have, uh, see some bullish momentum on on bitcoin
because also, bitcoin miners, they need to pay for electricity renting or whatever
and, um, they do not want to sell their hard work, okay, mined bitcoin that has been costing a lot of electricity at these levels
and this is a good also for not having too much selling pressure
um, i was 20 minutes younger before andy started to analyze chain link
let's take a look at a coin right away and see what's going on, right? i got this fibonacci level here for some reason, from this height
so a coin right over here, we did have this this high to this low
this is where i got this fibonacci level, and this is why we are getting this reaction from this 382, from this high to the low, hitting the 382
let me just get fibonacci out of the way, got absolutely crushed, absolutely insanely crushed
um, if we do, if we do come up to this level, this would be the most, the highest probability level where we could get that rejection, at the 540, approximately 540, 550, we do get that volatility coming up on a coin at this level, and start getting that reaction, getting a consolidation
what do i mean as a reaction where you want to see like a consolidation, right? at a major level, look at seeing that the balls cannot push higher
and then you will probably see gonna, you are probably going to see that that selling pressure, of course
and this is the best zone, in my opinion, from this high of the drop to the low, you are looking for that 50 percent six one eight fibonacci level, hitting big, bigger zones, okay, of resistance
you got the lows created from may, and you also got the low base here, which is at the six one eight
so if you do get that volatility at this range and start having this kind of price action in the coming days, that will be the signal to actually, you know, saying, this is very likely going to get rejected
or a daily update, two videos coming tomorrow, no doubt, no doubt
doing full analysis on bitcoin, taking a look at the highest probability levels for potential trades, keeping it straight to the point
i know that this week people have been preferring, um, people are are preferring live streams, but i will be doing a daily update, see if that performs well
so you're saying, from lower highs, probably this dxy broke out trendline
someone saying in the comment section, i guess it's this lower high trend line
and we are going to see a little bit of bullish momentum to come and retest these highs again, probably, yes
if that does happen, we do, you know, there's a another scenario here on the dxy where we do actually, you know, we start pumping
we retest this resistance level and break it, and maybe continue to the upside
uh, in the next couple of weeks to hit again this major resistance trend line that was heavy, heavy support from the higher lows, very much
um, respected here with this large consolidation that we just had a few days ago
um, uh, we have been waiting for you all this day long, it says, naughty witty
i'm going to be protecting my position if we start dropping from this range
um, i do think that we could come down at least to retest the 203 204 k levels
um, potentially this has been a kind of a liquidity grab right there, gaining these highs, getting resistance from this trend line at this uh, ascending channel
sorry, low range of the channel can be retested, maybe in the next coming hours, between today and tomorrow
nice move to the downside, you know, at least a three to one trade
and now, why would i be taking profits at this zone, at the 203 204, the reason why i'll be taking profits is because it's a big support level
it could react as support and could have some more bullish momentum
and also on prime xbt, you also get seven percent added to your deposit

and also take a look at the bitcoin sensor website if you are interested in news
also check it out, guys, because down below you have the website link
take a look at this latest article on on dogecoin on the bitcoin centre's website
and if it's not done tonight, tomorrow is going to be video update and a live stream to take a look at those potential training opportunities
i can't see what you're writing right now, but i hope everyone is feeling good
um, if you haven't already like the live stream, please do it right now
how are you? mariana, how are you? like, hello, marianna, again
how are you guys? if you haven't alread, if you haven't already like the live stream, please, please go inside and do that
have not done anything special since this morning live stream that we did
i am not in a position at all because the market has not, uh, girl, that bl blouse didn't last did it? nope
okay, so looking at dxy, what we did expect the market to do, uh, was to drop back down 103840 five, potentially one hundred eight hundred to three point four hundred and ninety dollars
and so i still like we can definitely pull back up a little bit
we can drag in other fibonacci because you can see how the market is creating lower lows and our highs
we just might have another lower high against the fibonacci levels at 104370, and then potential a continuation to drop to the downside
if that is the case, we can see that the market on bitcoin is, uh, continuing to the upside, right? um, we are inside the fibonacci levels
okay, i'm gonna take that first fibonacci away because it just looks so messy
so what i did a couple of hours ago was that we used the fibonacci from the key level 23 040 back down to 19 040
um, yeah, we do have a pretty strong bullish candlestick right now
and depending on how the market is so what i'm gonna do, i'm gonna take this baby away, and i'm gonna use the hi because, as you guys already know, i do look for sell opportunities
i actually like how the market uh, hello gaza, how are ya? i actually like how the market is looking at the moment um, even though i don't see any positions at all, even buy or sell opportunity
but definitely a future, um, a future setup that we can definitely have
this is where we could potentially expect the market to drop a little, uh, to drop
um, if but i wouldn't do anything unless we break below, uh, the last high low at 2 20 940
so if we break this level, creates a lower, lower low, when market pulls back up to create the lower high it's actually perfect right now
uh, i will not go into a trade at all, unless, sorry, i always yawn when i'm doing the live streams
it's just, i think when i talk too much, i get bored of my own voice
uh, what i'm gonna do is that i will take another, uh, support trendline right now, or a support, uh line with an alert
um, looking at the higher time frames perspective, looking at the 12 hourly, i think it's because it's really sunny outside
i'm not we're not used to sun in sweden, so when we do have the sun coming, you know, it takes some time for our bodies to adjust to the heat
so i become very sleepy when it comes to, when it comes to the sun, especially in the beginning of the summer in sweden, because as i told we're not used to the, to the heat, and it's pretty hot outside today
if we would see that the market is, i'm gonna take this box away
um, another thing that we can have in mind is that we're also retesting this previous support
can you see previous report just might turn into a new resistance
um, everything depends on how we we are, if we actually see a bigger, uh, bigger pull up, bigger, uh, continuation to the upside
if we have a potential higher low being created around 1164, this can definitely take us back up to higher targets, maybe this previous resistance also at 1236
um, but if we would break below, as you can see, the same thing that would you have on bitcoin
uh, what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna use this previous support at us, previous highly low around 1140
if the market breaks that level, i will look for some opportunities when the market gives me the lower low, because at that point we're breaking market structure
so we're gonna, we're gonna break below the previous higher low, create a lower low, potentially, then the market is, uh, giving us a lower high, and then continuation down
aj, what are you okay, we did have someone, uh, that wanted me to look at
i'm just waiting to see where the potential higher low and, uh, lower high can be
usdt, i swear to god, if aj would look at this live stream, i would start to stutter
market goes up, go clearly down, right? would you take a trade today? though, not unless the market respect the levels that i just spoke about
if the market doesn't give me what i need, i will not take a trade, so i remember
okay, so this is a fun story, right? this was not when i wasn't so good at trading
and he said, he told because we have a community at that time, and he said he promised everyone to take 10 trades per day
and i was like, but that's not possible, because you don't even know if you have 10, 10 setups
that's when you know when someone doesn't know how to trade, because you don't even know how the market's gonna look, right? you only put the levels, wait for the market to come to you, and then you take the decision
okay, looking at chain link, after i told you this beautiful story, um, i took 27 trades today and lost exactly that was that is what happens
so now can it can definitely be where we see the market retest the level and then see the market to to drop again
um, if we're looking at the, uh, the lower time frames, let's go to the 12 hourly chart
what i also will do is that i will drag the fibonacci from the fake out, from nine point one to eight, back down to five point forty six dollars
and we are right now retesting the fibonacci at seven point thirty eight dollars
let's go down to the lower time frames, and we will do the same thing right here
and on the lower time frames, what do we have? we have a previous resistance, previous support
if we break below this level, and you see the market break below seven points eighteen dollars, create the lower low potential retest
so what i'm also gonna do, because i want to start to trade, uh, link
i like link first from from, you know, i don't know why, but i definitely want to trade it
uh, so i'm gonna have an alert also if i see the market actually continuing on to the downside, and we are inside a higher time frames fibonacci, which means that this fibonacci is, uh, very respected
so if we would see that the market is breaking the support trend line retesting, uh, break these at the level at 718, it's a huge probability that we can see the drop from here
uh, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
um, if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, you can go inside and do that, because i do have daily updates about cryptocurrencies every single day
i did have a morning live stream, uh, at 8 00 am, swedish time, so one hour before london session
and, uh, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars
best bonus available right now, through me and bitcoin census
and the good thing when it comes to buy bits is that it's a very low fees that we want when we hold our positions for a longer time
just watched andy's show and hoped in here after seeing online
um, so what i'm gonna do is that i will use, let's see, i'll look on the two weekly charts
back down to the support at one point, five thousand one hundred and sixty five
do you know how many times i wanted to yawn after you said that i was not, i don't know, 12
okay, so i'm gonna change my fibonacci from, uh, two thousand six hundred and two points
go down to the lower time frames, we can see how the market did retest the fibonacci levels perfectly
can you see how this looks? market is below, uh, market is below the, the, uh, the fibonacci, 618 percent
let's see, because we are still, we could still, uh, see the market pull back even more to the upside
if i, if i use the previous higher low with the higher high, you can see how the market came back down and retested the 50 and the 618 percent
so for me not to get faked out, as it's very easy to, uh, to be, i want the market to break below, uh 17 400, create the lower low and then potential lower high, and then see the market continue to drop
even if we see that we did have a pretty strong bullish, a bearish candlestick, i still need the market to break this little resistance that we didn't have
this was a high high, market came back up, created another high high
but based on that, we're actually right now, retesting, uh, the the fibonacci levels
so i hope, uh, craig, that you, uh, you understood what i spoke about
how are ya? um, let's see, let's see what else you want me clean you lie
okay, i want to see how it looks on us 30, because we were looking at you as 30 today
right? so when we did have the morning live session, what i did expect the market to do, uh, when we came to um, you is 30
this is why, this is why it's so good to follow your strategy
because if i was just jumping into a trade based on that, we came and retested the 61, uh, the 50 on this fibonacci in whenever we we saw this huge push to the upside
can you see? i also used the fibonacci level, and the market actually took this was actually great setup
but it was like two thousand two hundred and seventy four pips to target three on us
and i was expecting, if i told you, i only sell the market if you break below this level, around 30 106
so i did not take this trade, because if i took the trade, i would have been in drought
so right now, what we do is that we're looking at the 618 percent
and now we just might potentially see the market have the drop, if this is the case
so for example, now we are retesting the 618 and by back testing, we know that the market can break above the 618 percent and still and then see the market reverse back down
can you hear that? so now, for example, if us 30 is breaking below three thirty thousand three hundred, and i obviously want the market to break below thirty thousand two hundred and sixty three, because that is the last higher low
so we can definitely see the market create the lower low, come back up for the lower high
you heard her? all in short, yes, what was that other they do something outside they're never done
you are amazing at explaining cryptocharts in a way that can easily be understood
okay, so looking at b b, because we were looking at b b this morning
here we see the market push back even more so we're looking at the supply level that we talked about this morning, around 230 dollars and 234 dollars
what we also could have done taking fibonacci from low to high
i'm not saying to buy the market, but to understand that this could actually be where the market is not finished with it with the pullback
how aya? how are ya? um, so yeah, this is the first level i look to see if the market is coming up to retest
but another thing that we can do is that we use this previous resistance um
so if we start to see the market, uh, break, have more momentum now to the downside, because this is exactly what i expect the market to do
so if we break below, uh, the support trendline and obviously the last higher level around 218, and then wait for the pullback, i'm i sell the market at the pullback
because right now i actually don't know if we will continue to the upside
we just might see the market pull back up to the supply level, and then see this huge drop
i'm just waiting for the market to break the support trendline before i take my decision
because, as i showed you, when it comes to be, uh, to you, is 30
if i just choose to sell the market now, based on that, i believe the market will break down
it cannot depends on but, oh yeah, you should follow your rules
so this trade was absolutely not valid, you see? okay, so looking at the higher time frames on solana, look at the two daily chart
i want to go to the higher time frames and just see, we also have this resistance in the lower time frame
my channel is perfect for newbies because i'm such a great teacher, and i'm very humble when it comes to the charts, and i'm very honest
and if you are a newbie, you can go to my youtube channel, subscribe to the channel, hit the notification so you know when i am live
but especially for newbies like you, darling, you go into my crypto trading for beginners, you go in and look at market structure, part one
you have to do this, leave a comment below and tell me what you what you thought about it
and i also have these back testing live streams that i explain exactly what i see on the charts
i i explain exactly how i use trend lines, how i use supply in demand zone
but, i mean, i'm, i'm a very simple trader, but i'm very good at what i'm doing
and if you like something, you can, i swear to god when i say that, you definitely can find something on my youtube channel
you can take something from me and implant it to your own traits
and don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below below the video
this is for experience traders, because it is about leverage trading
and leverage trading, you can obviously lose a lot of, uh, you can gain a lot of money, but also, there's a lot of money
but why is, uh, why buy bit is so good is that when we hold our positions for a longer time, especially as swing traders, the fees is the the best when it comes to that
we are right now, uh, we are, we are right now in between, uh, 3790 and 4010, uh, dollars
and this is the fibonacci level that i look for the market to potentially reverse back down from the last higher low that we can see is 3717
so i wouldn't, as said, as long as we are above the supported trend line, i'm not gonna take any sell positions at all
but if we break the level, break the support trend line, come back up for a retest against this support trend line, create acid resistance, or we test the previous high low, we will
um, why i don't sell the market right now? because you can see the market pull back up to forty point ninety dollars, and then see the market give us a higher low
and then you just might see the market, um, you know, bouncing between the levels, and then you see the break
so if i start to sell the market right here, market pulls back up, goes back down, goes back up, go i mean, this is just taking my time and energy, taking my time and energy
and i don't have time for that, you know, sitting at the charts, looking at my setup and being stressed because the market is, you know, the market is going up, yeah, because you're not following your strategy
and especially when it comes to the charts, because the charts can you know it can i and i know a lot of people, and especially if you are a beginner, what you do when you take a trade, you sit and look at the trades 24 7
if you sell the market, you're like, oh, my trade might trade
and sometimes, you know, the market is, the market is almost taking your stop loss sometimes
but if you look at it, oh, a lot of people take their trades out, oh, yeah, it's gonna take take profit
and then from nowhere, the market didn't even take your stoploss, and then it just went straight down
and just because you were looking at the charts the whole time, what happened? you you you you change your positions or you close the positions based on the emotions
i'm just here telling you, i know exactly what you go through
okay, so what we spoke about on dot, uh? so we came back down at this previous little support
i think i actually spoke about that, that, um, the market can pull back up to these levels based on this candlestick
also, i did expect the market to give us some bullish momentum
uh? so what i did was that i took a trade from fibonacci from 1050 back down to 704
we can go down to the lower time frames and see if it looks better
because we're using, not, i'm i will not use these, uh, this candlestick, because that what it looks
so i'm looking at eight point thirty two dollars and eight point twenty seven dollars
and what happens? the market usually comes to the supply zone
but as i said, i don't do anything unless we're breaking the support trend line
and we also need to break this previous higher low around 17 points and 96 dollars, create the lower low, potential lower high
natalie, i want to include you in an upcoming video of other crypto traders that teach solid ta that i admire and bring internality and value of the space
can i contact you in some way? i don't know what you what you want to do, but you, you can give me your um [Music] contact
yeah, road dog crypto, what you can do is that you go into the community
we do, i do have the community on, i do have a community on telegram that you can be part of
so, yeah, on dots, we wait for the market to break below and seven points and ninety dollars
because we can also see the market break above the previous resistance, create a higher low, and then see the continuation, right? so we do have two, two possible, possible scenarios
either break to the upside and continue back up to potentially eight point, seven to six dollars, or break below the previous higher low, create a lower low, create the lower high around potentially 797, and then see the drop
so this is why i'm just, you know, i have the patient to wait
so i can't trade every single day if the market doesn't give me the opportunity
if you haven't already liked the live stream, it is 128 people on this live stream
please guys help me with the algorithm so we can reach out to more people, grow this channel with me
so we can help people that is a little bit confused and feel alone when it comes to shaving
so what i did on theater and i took a fibonacci from 1780 back down to a 185 dollars
and we are right now pulling back up to retest the daily fibonacci
and from these levels, this is where i potentially can expect the market to drop
so we are at a previous resistance where we saw the market try to break this level
so the resistance is between set one point three hundred and forty seven dollars and one point three hundred and seventy two two dollars on the lower time frames
right now, on the one hourly chart, if, if we would see that the market breaks below 1300
this is where i expect the market to drop if we see the continuation to the upside as i told you
i'm looking at the charts wondering, what would natalie, what would natalie do? oh, you're so fun
they woke me up this morning with their beautiful voice, singing, wake up, natalie, wake up
yeah, i was actually, uh, so i have like a comedian, tick tock, um
and one girl, she wrote, seagulls are screaming like the whole world is about to end
but we can look at matic because, yeah, this does not happen yesterday at all
okay, so on matic, i know and anyone, you didn't ask me for it, but on matic, we could retest between zero point four hundred and forty six dollars and zero point four hundred and seventy dollars
and from this level, if we see the break of structure, same thing, continuation back down
but we need to break the support trendline if we see more momentum to the upside
we're looking at daily fibonacci um, zero point four hundred and ninety dollars and zero point five hundred twenty four dollars
no, and i talk pretty fast in swedish too, talk pretty fast and sweet
so, you know, we did look at salon andre, so you can go back, uh, you can go back and watch the the live stream if you want to
okay, we're looking at, we are looking at a previous support that we can come back up and retest on avex
everything depends on where the market choose to come and retest, and then see the reverse
and then want to see the see the market break, we can go down to the one hourly chart
or i if i would see the market break below with the prices that we do have on the charts right now, because those are the only ones that i can use
if we break below that level, market creates a potential lower high
when the market creates the lower low, we're using a fibonacci again, from the last higher high to that lower low
and the market will then give me the the levels where the lower high can be created
and i usually base it on the fibonacci and previous, uh, higher low
because when you break the heart the previous higher low, that is a break of structure, and that is the sign that they pull back
because what we're looking at right now is a pullback at the moment, because the overall the market is going down
so that's when, that is why i look for the break of structure
ftm ftm usdt, but i'm no financial advisor, so yesterday we took a trade where i took a trade, and a lot of people took it
do you know why i say it's very important for us to use risk management? because when we use risk management, i mean, your heartbeat is not, your heartbeat is not beating the same way
we use the previous uh, we used the fibonacci to look back in time and see what level we also retest
and you can see that the fibonacci levels is pretty good, combined with the previous support a previous, um, a previous resistance, and then saw the break to the upside
so what we're looking at right now, when it comes to phantom, it's a pretty good because i also use the fibonacci from 04 3337 back down to 02 1190
so if you can hear my computer and the seagulls, you know what it is
but before we pull back up to, before we pull back up to zero point three thousand two hundred eighty four and zero point three thousand five hundred and thirty eight, we are right now retesting the twelve hourly fibonacci
uh? and that is at zero point two thousand two hundred twenty thousand, 2929 and 03 1124
from these levels, this is where i could potentially expect the market to reverse back down
we're taking the help or of the supported trend line, because you just might see the market pull back down and retest it as a higher low, and then see the market pull back up to the higher target, and then see the reverse back down
i don't buy the market at the high high, and i don't sell the market at the high high either
i sell the market at the lower high, and i buy the market at the higher low
and once all you do is, i love to watch and learn from her, and she's so easy on eyes, too
so, yeah, the i if ftm doesn't give me the best setup at the moment um, but this is, this is what i look for
can you please, can you please tell me where you're from? we have 144 people on this livestream
so tell me, guys, where are you from? where are you from? oh, australia, yes
and if you haven't already like the live stream, guys, you know exactly what to do
like the live stream so you can help me to grow the channel so we can reach out to more people
and guys, if you want to be part of, uh, my community, bitcoin census, natalie, you have the link in the description in the live stream
what i do is that i take a fibonacci from 8698 back down to 4160
and that is also combined with previous support that we do have around 6185 looking at the lower time frames
um, this is definitely a level where we can see the market reverse back down from, based on the fibonacci
we have the people here again that we know exactly who that that person is
so if we break below 6040, and that is breaking the previous higher low, also, we can see the market create the lower low, potential lower high
and that's where i potentially see the market break down, right? um
so everything depends if we break the support, or if we see the market give us another higher high
and i know that a lot of people don't have that patient to wait
i know someone said something about waves usdt, the market is really boring
what i did was that i took another fibonacci from um, uh, 974 back down to 437
and we could potentially now see a retest from, i mean, this is pretty is
i mean, this is why i don't like certain cryptocurrencies, because, you know, the market is, they're very unpredictable sometimes, and especially when it comes to these huge movements
because usually what the huge movements can be that the market is then from nowhere, you know, have a huge bounce rate
but i can still use fibonacci between seven dollars and potentially seven point sixty four dollars, um, but i wouldn't do anything, because the market is just going straight up, mark is just going straight up
um, no, no good market structure, to be honest, at these levels
you see on bitcoin, we're waiting for the market to break, uh, right now
um, 21 040, to potential lower low, and then see the market pulls back up to create the lower high
if we don't see the market push back up to potentially 22 190
we're waiting for the market right now to break the previous higher low at 1 140, create another lower, lower low, market pull back up to create the lower high, and that's where i potentially sell the market then
so guys, if you are new to the channel, don't forget to go in and subscribe to it
as i told you, you have the crypto trading for beginners, where i do explain very easily how the market is, um, how i see the market
also, very good, very, very good videos where you can learn a lot
so, yeah, i will we can definitely have a another back testing session during this week, when we just go into the charts and back test it
but i usually like to do it a little bit later, um, during the nights in sweden
you can also receive a bonus on bio baits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so thank you so much everyone that take, took their time to be on this live stream
don't forget that if you want to be part of, not, uh, not only be consensus community, you also have the link in the description, uh, in pinned in the chat
uh, thanks natalie for making a boring market fun and ex thank you
my name is josh, and right now this onchain metric is beginning to reverse, which will be very important to pay attention to moving forward
stock markets open up in the green today and the ethereum short positions at record low levels on this exchange
all of that and more in this video, so definitely stick around
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and as i said in the intro of this video, today has actually been a green day for the stock market
but obviously it goes without saying at this point that this is not a confirmed bullish reversal or anything like that
and in order to confirm an actual reversal back into a bullish trend, we need to start forming higher highs and higher lows here on the daily chart, which we obviously have not seen as of right now
but really, for the stock market to flip overly bullish again, we actually need to see inflation starts coming down and the fed starts easing a little bit
because while the fed is doing quantitative tightening and raising interest rate, of course, that is adding an extra cell pressure to the stock markets
and so moving forward, especially over the next few months, i'll be paying strong attention to the fed meetings and, more importantly, the inflation data, the cpi, that is coming in each month
and the next cpi release is in around three weeks from now, on the 13th of july
and what we can also see here on the nasdaq 100 index on the daily timeframe, is actually a small bullish divergence, because obviously we've formed lower lows and we've seen higher lows in the rsi
so technically speaking, this means in the somewhat shorter term, we should be due for reduced bearish momentum, like what we're seeing at the moment, with a small shortterm bounce
and this is, of course, quite similar to the shortterm bitcoin price action
here on the 12hour chart, we have a confirmed bullish divergence, which has been playing out over the past few days
and on top of that, around one to two days ago, we saw a bullish cross in the 12hour bitcoin macd, which is obviously more of a bullish signal than a bearish signal
but keep in mind, we saw both of these signals, the bullish divergence and the bullish cross in the macd, on the 12 hour time frame roughly around a month ago
and like i said in yesterday's video, this basically led to more choppy, sideways press action in the shorter term, which is mostly what i'm expecting moving forward over the next few days
and if you're zooming out to the weekly bitcoin chance, not much has happened since yesterday
and so technically speaking, according to pretty much the last decade of bitcoin price history, around these important moving averages, right now, the bitcoin price is still trading within this area of maximum opportunity
and this area i'm talking about is in between the 200 week moving average and the 300 week moving average, which are coming in at around 22 and a half thousand and around 16 and a half thousand respectively
and once again, historically speaking, we see some of the most significant bitcoin bottoms around these moving averages, the 200 week and the 300 week moving average, as some of the best possible buying opportunities, according to bitcoin's history
but with that being said, taking a look at this important bitcoin onchain chart, which shows us the percentage of bitcoin supply that was last active over one year ago
and so basically, if you bought a bitcoin over one year ago, and you have not moved that bitcoin in one entire year, then that would show up in this metric right here
and you might be wondering what this actually means for the bitcoin price
and basically, during the bearish times in the market, especially in bear markets, but even just in boring, sideways times in the markets, we usually see this on chain metric spike to the upside, which is, once again, the percent of bitcoin supply that was last active over one year ago
so basically in the boring or bearish times in the market, like bear markets, for example, it's very common to see the bitcoin supplier become less active during the boring or bearish times in the market
and then what we see in this onchain metric is, of course, it starts flattening out
and during that time in the market, there's more older coins start moving around
and during these times in the markets where we see the older coins start moving around more, and this on train metric starts turning around to the other side
that means we're about to flip more bullish again in the bitcoin price action, as we've seen it time and time again
because generally speaking, it's heading into the bullish price action where we see the longterm holders start offloading some of their bitcoin over to the new bitcoin holders
and we especially see a lot of that happening towards the top of a bull market, which is why the percent of bitcoin supply drops to the downside towards the top of a bull market, because more of bitcoin supply is moving around amongst new investors
so just quickly going over the last decade of bitcoin's price history, towards the end of 2012, entering into early 2013, we saw this on chain metric begin to reverse
and what came next was, of course, the 2013 bull market that happened pretty much over the next one year
and then as this on 10 magic was flattening out and beginning a bottom that was telling us we were about to get ready for our next major bear market
and of course, that bottom in this onchain metric was in early 2014
and that was right towards the beginning of the 2014 bear market
that lasted for the rest of 2014 and into early 2015, which is where this onchain metric had already spiked it upside during the bear market
but it began flattening out during 2015 as the bear market was basically bottoming out
and then when it really flattened out and began reversing, that is when we started to enter towards the 2016 and then 2017 bull market
and during the main part of the bull market in 2017, we saw a massive dropoff in this onchain magic, which once again, shows a lot of older coins moving around into newer hands
and then as this metric began slowing its downwards movements and began at bottoming out, that was when the 2018 bear market was beginning
and then we saw a spike to the upside in this onchain metric during the bear market
and then right around the end of the 2018 bear market, we saw this onchain magic begin to reverse again as the bitcoin price flipped much more bullish
and then we entered a very boring time period in the market in the second half of 2019 and early 2020
so for the most part, during that time period, right there, we saw this on chain magic begin to climb, but as it began flattening out and reversing back to the downside, that was telling us we were getting ready for our next significant bullish move in the bitcoin price
and then after we played out a lot of bullish price action, when the bitcoin price got up towards around 60 000, we saw this bitcoin on chain magic begin reversing back to the upside, which was showing more bearish price action to come
but right now it is beginning to reverse back to the downside
and once again, every single other time where we've seen this onchain magic reverse back to the downside, throughout the last decade of bitcoin's price history, we've seen more bullish price action for bitcoin later on in the coming months and years, according to this onchain magic, time and time again
but let me know what you think about this chart right here in the comment section down below
and if we're taking a look at the bitcoin long positions on the bfnx exchange on the weekly time frame, these traders on this exchange in particular seem to agree that we could be due for some sort of bullish reversal, because what is really interesting is right now these long positions are actually at an alltime high level
in fact, right now there's nearly 109 000 bitcoin sitting in these bitcoin long positions on the bifinix exchange, which is equivalent to over 2 billion us
and for any of the beginners out there, all of this money right here, two billion dollars worth of bitcoin, is essentially betting on the bitcoin price going up
but i want to make it clear that this chart and the last two charts that i covered, this on chain chart and this weekly bitcoin chart, they are all longterm bitcoin charts
because once again, when it comes to the shorter term, i'm mostly expecting choppy, sideways press action over the next few days, maybe even over the next couple weeks, depending on what the stock market is doing
and these other bitcoin charts, once again, are talking about the longer term, as in at least a few months from now, but potentially over the next couple years
and if we're getting into the shortterm ethereum analysis today, this right here is the 12hour ethereum to your dollar chance
once again, we still have an active bullish diversions in play and a bullish cross in the 12 hour ethereum macd, which is very similar to what we saw around a month ago, just before we experienced a lot more choppy, sideways price action for ethereum, especially over the next few days, is what i'm mostly expecting
and we still have strong support at around a thousand dollars, more specifically at around 1050, due to this 382 fibonacci level coming into play at around 1050
and obviously, the weekly ethereum rsi is still well and truly in oversold territories like bitcoin
and if we're staying on the weekly timeframe, but taking a look at the ethereum short positions on the bifidex exchange right now, they're basically at all time lows
and once again, if there's any beginners out there that don't know what a short position is, it's basically betting that the price is going down
so an ethereum short position is betting that the ethereum price is going down
so if the whales over on bifenex have closed almost all of their shore positions, and right now sitting at record low levels of shore positions
that means that these traders on this exchange in particular, are not feeling very confident that we could see more downside price action, because, of course, their bet on that downside price action is very, very small right now
in fact, it's the smallest it's ever been on this exchange in terms of ethereum
and if we're looking at the last alltime low level for these short positions on this exchange, before we broke it, that was right at the end of 2019, entering into early 2020
and looking at that same area on the ethereum to us dollar chart on the weekly time frame, that was right around here as the price of ethereum was essentially bottoming out, apart from that march 2020 crash where we did actually go a little bit lower
but during that entire time period in the market, the room to the downside on the bigger picture, the weekly time frame, the longer term chart, was somewhat limited
now unfortunately, that can't necessarily be repeated for the ethereum versus bitcoin chart on the weekly time frame
because clearly, if you're looking at this bear market compared to the 2018 bear market, we technically still have more room to the downside, because we have not actually seen much downside price action for ethereum versus bitcoin here on the weekly charts, compared to the last bear market
now keep in mind, ethereum was not around for the 2014 bear market, so we really only had the 2018 bear market as our only other significant bear market throughout ethereum's history
so unfortunately, when it comes to ethereum, we don't have a lot of data points to compare, which exposes us to potential inaccuracy
but anyway, if we do take a look at the 2018 bear markets, what we saw around the weekly rsi was the fact that we did actually enter into oversold territories during the end of the 2018 bear market, right around here
but obviously, even at the end of the 2018 bear market, when ethereum at bitcoin bottomed out against the us
dollar and started heading back to the upside, we still ended up seeing one more significant dropoff for ethereum vs bitcoin over the next six to eight months
and once again, i wish there was more bear markers to compare to for ethereum, but unfortunately, we only have that 2018 bear market to take a look at
and so just keep in mind what we actually saw in the 2018 bear market, and what we saw even after that bear market, and what we've seen this year alone
but of course, i would still be paying strong attention to this level of support coming into play at around 0049 bitcoin per ethereum
and make sure to check out this video popping up right here on your screen if you want to find out how you can keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
all right, everyone, welcome back to the channel for another ta episode on bitcrane
in today's episode, the lower high, we're going to be navigating a few bitcoin charts
we're going to be looking at things like the fear and greed index, talking about the next countdown to the next fomc, and talking about a few charts that i haven't mentioned, uh, in a short period of time
now, this is a chart, basically we're going to start our focus on the alltime high for bitcoin, up here at 69 000
and right off the bat, you can see there's two vertical lines in the sand, the fourth of may and the 15th of june
as you can tell, within both of these fomc meetings, you know, whether we bounced into the fomc or whether we bounced after the fomc, you can very much tell that we are in a lower, low, lower high structure
but if we start off from the basis, if we start off from when we topped out at the alltime high, what did we do? we had a big, big capitulation back down to the downside, down to 42 000
and as soon as we came into the daily ema rubun's slap, we got absolutely booted back down to the downside
and as you can see, if we highlight these past couple of moves, you can very much tell the market structure is completely unchanged, uh, despite the moves that we have been having, and, you know, i would also like to highlight, uh, the last two moves, respectively, have been 46 and 275
now, if we zoom into what we've done in the past couple of days, you can see we are up 24, and we're already struggling to have a continuation of momentum
you can really tell there is not a lot of volume coming up and supporting this trend
what you can see is we had basically, i mean, if we zoom out, i, i guess high quality would probably define this a lot better
but you can see, you know, these nice, nice swings up in terms of bullish volume, nice massive up or bearish volume
rival we have these massive swings up in terms of bearish volume, and then we get a tiny, tiny bit of balls stepping back into the market, and it seems to be relatively flat and stagnates before it starts to generally move back down to the downside
and we're already seeing that we've got absolutely no strength, uh, within this move, at least in my opinion
we've only been bouncing for two days, and like, once again, you know, people are getting out of bed for this lower high
so, you know, technically speaking, i know this is not what people want to hear, but in order to break the market structure on the daily time frame, you would have to move above 32 500
there is absolutely no target that we would um, there is absolutely no other target that is even really too relevant at this point in time
if you do not break above 32 500, uh, say, for example, i know myself, personally, i don't think we're going to go this high
but let's say we go up to like 31 000 and start to move back down
this would still, once again, be a lower high, and we would probably be coming back down, uh, to put a lower low within this market structure
now, another very key area, which we would definitely need to push above if you did want to be bullish, would be the past fomc meeting date price
now, we pumped up onto the fomc on the 15th, and just like we predicted when we were talking about the fomc, we were going to slide down on the 16th, and that's exactly what we did
because, you know, for example, myself, i might get out of bed temporarily, uh, to make some, you know, shortterm positions in the market if we do move up above 22 850
but, you know, can you imagine, if we come up to twenty two thousand eight hundred and fifty, we back test the fomc meeting date price, and then we just start moving back down to the downside? you know, this would be another lower high of about thirty percent
which, you know, once again, i think this, uh, this tweet that i reshared over on my twitter calls it perfectly
people get out of bed for a small move, and again, and again and again
we have these cyclical bounces, and it happens again and again, and again and again
i like to, you know, look at trends, use mathematical indicators
and, you know, do get out of bed for these smaller time frame moves
but i really don't see anything to be getting out of bed for at this moment in time, daily time frame, the squeeze bomb is still definitely holding in favor of the bears
now, lower time frames, you know, uh, we are kind of coming into these four hourly emas
and bitcoin has proved a few times that the four hourly ema's are not necessarily the best indicator to use
uh, for example, the fourhour emas almost perfectly works on cryptocurrencies like solana
but a lot of the time, you know, on the btc four hourly chart, you'll actually see this flip bullish
i mean, this had two fake outs, and this literally flipped bullish, uh, the moment, like, literally within a couple of days, we were boom, all the way back down to the downside
and i would also like to highlight, you know, we, we are just setting up these super, super nasty bear flags, and we've once again had this mass capitulation
and this is why i think, you know, we're obviously not going to go down in a straight line, but we are pretty much having these straight poles back down to the downside
and this, once again, this is what people get out of bed for, before we do initiate the next move to the downside
so right off the bat, this chart, uh, very important that we do take out, uh, 22 800 before, in my opinion, i even consider, you know, making leverage long trades
because, like i said, until you do come up to the top here and take out 32 400, nothing would have changed
now, if we do look at the fear and greed index, very interestingly, uh, we were sitting at six for the past couple of days, and we've recently moved up to nine
so, you know, it's very evident that we're still sitting in extreme fear
i mean, if we look at the fear and greed, it's basically the bitcoin price
you can see we've just been massively, massively capitulating since the alltime high
so, you know, this this market structure that we've got going on right now for the fear and greed index, is once again, still very, very bearish
and, uh, i do not think the bottom would necessarily be in at this moment in time
i would also like to highlight, when we do get into this structure where we are putting in these extremely, you know, dark red uh, dark red dots over on the fear and green index
so, you know, i would like to emphasize, because, you know, there might be people who are new to my channel
i really don't think we're going down too much, uh, too much further
so right off the bat, you know, i'm not calling for, like, a major capitulation
i'm not calling for, you know, ten thousand, twelve thousand, fourteen thousand
i think we're gonna have a move down to sixteen point five, and then i think we're going to have a big, big relief rally back up
i think we're gonna have a massive move back down, and it's going to be a higher low
and that is when we can finally be confident that the market structure has changed
now, talking about changes in market structure, i would actually like to show you what's going on with the total crypto market cap
because it does seem like, even though bitcoin is bearish, the crypto market, it doesn't really care
i mean, as you can see, you know, we've got a low down here, we've got a higher high, higher low, higher high, higher low, higher high
and in my opinion, it looks like we're coming down to form another higher low before we do move back down, uh, before we do move back up to the upside um
there's only one thing wrong with this chart though, it's on the inverse scale
so, you know, once again, if you did agree with me with that analysis, that we are in a higher high and higher low trajectory, then you should agree with me when we snap back to reality, that the market structure is completely unchanged
and on the daily time frame for the total crypto market cap, we've done nothing but make, you know, high, low, low, low, low, high, low, low, low, high, low, low and another low high
but the only difference is, with this bounce is, at this moment in time, we haven't even managed to have a fake out above the 13 ema
and subsequently, you know, uh, once again, i wouldn't be surprised if we do continue with this bounce for another short period in time before we do start to push back down to the downside
but with that being said, as you can tell, i mean, we're not even up to this level yet
so i think it'd be very interesting if the total crypto market cap could move back up to 1 trillion, if it knocked on the door of 1 trillion, and then, you know, the door gets slammed in its face, then this would probably be the point in time where we do start to capitulate
and this is when i want to talk about the macro structure that we do have going on on the total crypto market cap
now, what you'll notice at this moment in time is, if i clear this up, let me get rid of these, uh, let me get rid of these data points
so it's very, very, uh, simple and clear and clear what is going on at this moment in time
and if we head up back over to the weekly what you'll see is, from our fibonacci, from our low to the high, we've put a horizontal ray over the 786 fibonacci
this should be a bullish indicator, right? because, you know, basic fibonacci theory, you draw your fib from the low to the higher
if we stay above the 618, great, that means the market structure is very, very bullish
if we stay above the 786, it's kind of like a, you know, uh, sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe it's, it's okay, you know, it's really nothing special
but you can come down to the 786, have a bounce, and then you can resume with bullet bullish market structure
but we should look at previous trends to help us decide, is this what we are going to be doing in this market cycle? now, if we look at what the total crypto market cap did in 2018, you can see, uh, the total crypto market cap actually topped in, uh, june of 2019, which is interesting
what you'll notice is it had this massive, massive runup, bang, came all the way down, and this is where we came down to the 786 fibonacci
and we subsequently printed a pretty large bounce for the total crypto market cap
but what did we do? we subsequently, a couple of months later, slipped right back down, and we had that one last capitulation before the bottom was in
and this is another one of these reasons to back up my points on why i'm saying, you know, i do not believe that bitcoin is starting a bear market
now, i do not believe that there's, you know, going to be macro capitulation after macro capitulation after macro capitulation
i think we're sitting in the last of the move now, i've talked about this before
if we look at my elliott wave structure, if i head over to the weekly time frame, i really only want to spend like, uh, 20 seconds on this, but you can see, you know, basic elliott wave structure
i'm not going to talk about our last, uh, last run up, but you can see classic abc correction into the bear market
you've had your one wave impulse, you've had your free wave impulse, and you've had your five wave impulse
and we are in the macro abc correction, just like we see in every bear market now, within these last moves
because when you move back down to your abc correction, your a, and you'll see contain five microwaves, and we've already had, you know, your one, two, three, four, five
and this is why i'm saying, you know, i, i do think we are in this last leg to the downside
there are many, many charts which categorically state that we are getting ready for the final capitulation
this is really kind of just drawn to, uh, to the next level down over on the chart
but nonetheless, this is where i think we're drop we're going to be dropping down to at 16 500, which is where the 300 week moving averages
if we look at the btc usd chart and we come over to the 300 week, the 300 week has started to move up
now i'm going to move over to this chart in just one moment's time
i'd like to quickly highlight we have 35 days until the next fomc countdown
and once again, chicago mercantile exchange are calling for another 100 likelihood of an interest rate hike
now, i previously mentioned this before, because these, these guys do have pretty good predictions
and you know, i was looking at this before the previous fomc meeting, and, you know, once again, they had 100 likelihood it happened
they called it, and i still do think that they are going to call it this market, uh, or this fomc meeting
and i do think the fed are subsequently going to continue to increase the interest rates
now, there's one more thing i do want to share over on my twitter and that is this, if we look at the ecb balance sheet, this is just hit new alltime high
so, you know, what does that mean, if you're a normie? it basically means, you know, the fed is nonstop printing
and how do they counter that inflation? they're raising the interest rate
so this means normal people like me, normal people like you who are watching this video, we're the ones who have increases in, you know, how much our bills are
for example, the cpi, the consumer price index, shot up to 86 percent
and this just means, from the last year, if you were to walk into your regular shop wherever you live in the us, if you went in to buy x amount of groceries this year, now costs 86 more
so subsequently, all of this inflation is bleeding into, you know, retail traders and the average joe
and subsequently, there's less money in the markets right now
and this is very clearly displayed by how the stock market is reacting
i mean, we're seeing money flow out of the stock market like there's no tomorrow
and this is because interest rates are getting absolutely bombarded to the upside
the, uh, total as well, which is the total crypto market cap, is also getting bombarded to the downside
so what is one other interesting thing, uh, to notice when we are talking about bitcoin and the stock market? now, once again, i would just like to very, very quickly highlight, when we do look at the total upgrade market cap, first market cycle, back in 2018 over here, when we had our big ball run, we did not hold the 786 fibonacci
coming over to the next i, you know, you can call this a bull runner, it's kind of debatable, uh
but nonetheless, we had a massive, massive increase, uh, over on the total crypto market cap
and you know, this massive, massive, uh, macro run up did not hold the 786 fibonacci
and you can go back into further market cycles, and, uh, you find this to be true with all of the market cycles
but nonetheless, i'll leave that to you if you do want to do that
so if we look at the dollar and if we look at the stock market, very, very similar things going on here
if you inverted the dollar, so it was moving to the downside, and you looked at the spy, you can also see that this is very, very similar
so, you know, a while ago, we called for this diamond top over on the stock market, and we've been absolutely getting wrecked ever since
and just like the crypto markets, what you'll notice is, you put your highs, you've got your lower highs, lower highs, lower highs, lower highs
and, you know, once again, this is, this is the bounce that people are getting out of bed for
you know, we've moved up, we've moved up four percent on the stock market since the lows
and, you know, what? this is what the old crane, uh? this is what the old crane holders are throwing themselves out of bed too
they're running to the door to buy their oak cranes, which they currently deem cheap
uh? but, like i've been saying, you know, i've been here since 2018, and the market structure is exactly unchanged
the sentiment in the market right now is basically what it was like in the in the final capitulation
and i tweeted this over on twitter as kind of a meme, but it's also very serious
i do not believe the bottom is in until, you know, the normal put the normal persons, the average joes, are in crippling debt, and they can no longer buy the oak plain dip, that is when the bottom is in, because that is when the smart money comes and takes advantage of those cheap prices
notice how i emphasize cheap at that moment in time, because that is when crypto is cheap
the crypto crypto is cheap when the total crypto market cap capitulates below the 786 fibonacci
oak cranes are cheap when old cranes capitulate below the 786 fibonacci of the total crypto market cap
we've been bouncing on it, but we haven't had that capitulation
this is not the old crane's first rodeo when it comes to taking out the floorboards and going down, taking out the 786
and this is why i'm thinking, you know, once again, this is another reason we are sitting at that 786 fib at this very moment in time
and when we were lowly gagging into the 786 fib the last time, coming back into the 2018 bear market, what did we have until the bottom is in? we had one final flush out, and then the bottom is in
so i really do just, you know, obviously, people do, do what you want with your own money
but i really do think one last capitulation is going to be coming before the bottom is in
and i definitely do plan on taking advantage of what i actually deem to be cheap prices
you know, people have been saying, over on twitter, over on youtube, the old cranes are cheap for the past six months
and you know, if you go look back at when they were saying all cranes are cheap a couple of months ago, when you look back to what they were saying six months ago, look at the us
dollar values of all of those all cranes, those were not cheap old cranes
just like at this moment in time, we still do not have cheap old cranes
so one other thing, one other metric that i would like to talk about, because we looked at the stock market, we talked about the fact that at this moment in time we're making lower lows and lower highs throughout the board on the stock market
you can see, this is a very, very bullish chart pattern playing out over on the stock market right now
now, you can argue, you know, yes, this would just be your runofthemill ball flag
and, you know, subsequently, this does look very, very good in of itself
you can even see the ball flag, or the press action, rather, women the ball flag has come down to the 13 ema, and it looks like it wants to push back to the upside
i want to talk about this massive, massive cup and handle pattern that is literally playing out right in front of our eyes
and if the dollar does take one last leg to the upside, you can potentially see if we look at our fibonaccis, because, you know, once again, we came up, we made a local high that we have not seen in like, 20 years
i'm not meaning to say 10 years, because we have to zoom out a while
the dollar came up quite recently, broke up above its local high that it set in around the 13th of may
and once again, if we head over to our other dxy chart so you can see a lot clearer, this is a textbook cup and handle pattern
i was going to draw a horizontal ray on it, but i want to get the approximate price target from this
and let's see where this plans out to first, because i wouldn't necessarily, no, this, this almost perfectly lines up with my price targets that i've got on the dollar
so, you know, this cup and handle pattern would be taking us up to 108
whereas my personal fibonacci target, let's see what we've got here, because we had, we had another fib over on the board
but more importantly, i think that 110 is going to be a mass psychological level for the dollar
so we could see, and once again, this is what i mean by the final capitulation
and then, you know, at this point in time, the dollar would be way, way, way extended, and it would probably start to crash back down
and this is when i think that is is the right time to pick up some upgrades
you know, i've been keeping the same energy for the past couple of months
and yes, you know, i've been making these similar videos every two or three weeks or so
and just like i tweeted over here once again to show you the same thing, what happens is we come down
we come down twenty percent, and then we come up like nine percent, ten percent
and you know, people celebrate the nine percent move, but you know, it is just another dip after the dip, after the dip, after the dip, after the dip
and when you do zoom out on this market structure, you can very much tell that we are still in that lower high trajectory
so stock market is heading down, as i'm expecting the dollar to keep on heading up and the stock market to keep heading down
how will this affect bitcoin? well, one easy way we can do this is we can quantify the btc usd price divided by the spy
so this is simply telling you how many units of the spy can you buy with beat with bitcoin
so you know, at this moment in time, if we look over on the yaxis on the right side of the screen, you'll notice this is currently popping in at a value of approximately 552
what does this mean? this simply means that at this moment in time, one bitcoin can buy you 55 odd units of the spy stock market
and this makes sense, because if we look at the spy, the price is currently sitting around 375
you times that by 55, and boom, just like clockwork, you get the bitcoin price
now, why would we want to know how bitcoin is performing against the spy? and almost, you know, this looks like the btc usd price, uh, apart from the fact that we've massively capitulated a lot further than we have over on the btc usd price already
well, one important thing that this chart does tell us is, at this moment in time, when bitcoin is in bearish phases, it goes down against the spy, meaning that, you know, if we look at the sp why, we can also see that the spy is heading down
at this moment in time, we it's very, very clear that the sby is having a massive move back down to approximately 350 before i expect that we would see any type of bounce
but what's important to know is that bitcoin is underperforming the stock market
and by the way, this is where i think we're going to be stopping off on the spy, which i really don't think is too too bearish
i'm predicting about another 15 to 16 flush out to the downside before the market cycle lows are at least in within the monthly time frame
and why do i think we're coming down to the 300 week? well, if we look back at what happened in basically every bear market, in every bearish market structure, i mean, specifically, we can look at this pandemic event in march of 2020, we capitulated much lower than the 300 week
you know, we had a massive, massive move to the downside, all the way below the 300 week
and you know, what happened in march of 2020 definitely up for debate, but i in my opinion, it wouldn't be up for debate
what we're witnessing at this moment in time is 10 times more bearish for the markets than what we saw back here
and subsequently, you can see, we've only come down 25 percent so far
whereas the spy, uh, or the s p 500, you know, a lot of people might be new to my channel, the spy is simply the s p 500
this was very, very shortlived, very, very quick, and then we were out of here
and subsequently, we're, you know, we're subject to these higher price volatility swings to the upside
so when we had the black swan event, it was pretty much just boom
and it's like, oh, is the moon coming back? no, we're going to zero
and i have no doubt that i'll probably be making a video similar to this in the next three to four weeks, once we go down another 25 and then we poke our heads up five percent, and people saying, is is the bottom now in? but once again, my friends, the spy cycle, over cycle, over cycle tends to like to capitulate down to the 300 week in these super, super bearish, uh, in these super, super bearish markets
now, in the last major recession we had, this was back in 2008, and i really don't think it's up for, this is not for debate either
if you look at the prices of things like oil, they are back at their 2008 recession levels
you know, you look at the stock market, you look at the dollar, the dollar's been at strongest in 20 years
bitcoins having its, you know, it's breaking market structure
it's breaking below its previous alltime high, which is just something we've not done before
this is very, very evident to me that we are in a completely different cycle due due to the geopolitical and geoeconomic news that is currently finding its way around the market
i mean, once again, i'll say it again, but i was here in the two 2018 bear market
and if you're surviving through this bear market, you are surviving for a bear market
and nonetheless, you know, there was a lot of bearish stuff going on, mainly fud but the markets were not acting as they were at this moment in time
and you look back at these crazy events, and we do come back to the 300 week, or we at least come back to the 200 week
like every single time we have these big cascades, we always come down to the 200 weeks
looking at market structures on these big, big dips, you know, the 2016 drop, 2018 bear market, that also correlated over to bitcoin
we look at the pandemic scare, these all capitulate to slash below the 200 week moving average
so you know, once again, the market structure that we're in at this moment in time is so much more bearish than what we were witnessing back then
i think it's pretty obvious that we're coming back down to the uh, to this orange line here, which once again, is the 200 week
now, if the stock market is likely to fall another six percent, what does this mean for bitcoin? well, we can look at how bitcoin performs against the stock market, and we know that when the stock market drops, the the bitcrane massively capitulates against the spy
and this could definitely take us down to the 300 week, knock us down another 10 percent, also take us down another peg
and on the btc usd price, i think this is where we start to find our bullish bottoming structure, around around sixteen thousand five hundred uh, which, once again, i did give you, uh, the price target for that that is because that's the, that's where the 300 week is
now, my, my least bearish price target at this moment in time is the previous cme gap
if we look back on the daily time frame, you can see, 11th of december, 2020, 18 500
and once again, i feel like this is another thing that's not up for debate, obviously
nothing is, nothing is set in stone, especially when it comes to these crypto markets, uh
and i do think, in the most conservative estimate, that bitcoin would be coming down another 1069
you can already look at what is happening on the daily time frame for bitcoin
and we've got another one of these massive wicks to the upside
if i find a relatively clean chart for you over on bitcoin, before we do wrap up this video, if i clear up all the drawings, you know, every single time we do this, every single time, we have these big wicks to the upside
what do they always have in common? it shows that balls are running out of momentum, and subsequently, bears are stepping back in to push the price down
what normally happens after you get these big, big wicks to the upside is the bears start to take over the trend
it's basically like the bears pushing the balls and realizing, you know, this this guys will talk, you know, he doesn't have any steam left
and this is when you get this big capitulation, big capitulation
uh, this this one was, you know, a very, very quick lived capitulation
uh, we moved down 22 percent, had a dead cat bounce lower high, like i said, as of the name of the video
and what did we do? we started to move back down in terms of the market structure
so once again, keeping this very, very simple, i think if you even want to get out of bed, uh, in the next couple of days or so, you would need to be getting out of bed, because we would be taking out 22 750 if we do not even get above 22 750, then i will be napping like a baby in my bed, knowing that this is once again, another lower high in this market structure
to actually break the market structure on the daily time frame, you would need to do this, you would need to break above 32 500
you'd need to come down, you know, probably into these ema ribbons, and you'd need to back test them at, you know, 27 000 or so, and then start to push up
and then you would have this, you you would start to have, you know, your low, uh, high, high, higher, low structure, until something like this happens, uh, then i do not think the bottom is in
but once again, you know, nothing has changed in the past couple of days
the interest rates paired with the inflation means that normies like me and you are going to be the ones bearing the brunt of inflation
and subsequently, we're going to find that our real wages are less
the amount of, uh, the amount of groceries that we can buy a store is going down
and subsequently, you know, the normal person just does not have as much money as they did to go all in on nfts of apes and and other stuff like that
so, you know, once again, this is basically all i've got for you today
this was probably one of my longer videos, uh, but once again, in my opinion, the bottom's not in
uh, yes, some of the alts have had a very, very nice bounce, but i do think it is time that we are going to start snapping back to reality
and i would also like to show you, you know, bitcoin against the stock market the week, uh, the week commencing
and also, even if we look at bitcoin on the weekly time frame, you know, this, this is, once again, what people are getting out of bed for
you've got this big wick to the upside, and it very much shows there's a lot of weakness in the market right now
the current bitcoin price is twenty thousand five hundred and seventy four dollars
you can see on this chart over here, if you have a look at the bitcoin price, you can see that we broke below the 255 m a on a weekly chart
we hit straight into that gray liquidity zone, which are outlined as a very important area
and i told you, once we break this level, good value for the longterm investors will be anywhere below that 255 that uh, if you are looking to add to your your huddle portfolio, this would be the region to do it in
however, will this bounce hold like there? you can see that the weekly chart started at the top here
is it going to bounce up and retest the 200ma? is it going to flip that as, uh, from previous support, and use it as a rejection or as resistance? well, that's what we're going to have to look at
there are a couple of other indicators that i'm i'm taking a look at to try and gauge whether this is going to happen or not
and the first and foremost is going to be the dexi, which is the, of course, the dollar index, the dollar measured against basket of other currencies around the world
and you can see, if you do take a look over here, this candle created somewhat of a deviation
and i'd like to see how it reacts at this previous area that was resistance, if it's going to flip that into support
now what i would imagine is probably going to happen is it's going to start to form some sort of a range within this area
and that stands true for a lot of the other indicators, or other tickers that i'm having a look at
it seems like most of the things are going to go into a little bit of a rangebound territory
and then we just need to see is that range going to break again to the up or the downside
having a look over here at the stock market, we have the nasdaq
i wouldn't be surprised i'm not calling anything yet because no, job numbers and everything are going to be coming out soon
so i'm not too sure what will happen, but i wouldn't be surprised to see some sort of a bounce first, and then set the next lower high, reject of that and come down to the key quarterly level, which is also marked with those precovered zones, which i was, i have been looking at for a long time
remember that any time that these government bonds are trending upwards, that's usually marks a negative sign for risk on assets, stocks, crypto, etc
however, if you look at this main liquidity area, which is coming in around between three point four seven percent and three point five six percent, this is on the fifth us30 uh yield, you can see it had a straight rejection out of that area
maybe there will be some sort of relief at the end of the day
i do still see this as a strong uptrend for the uh us 30, which would be bad for stocks and crypto
another thing that i'm having a look at over here, i haven't drawn, i haven't really, uh, marked out, uh, the, the all the necessary territories on the bitcoin dominance
but one thing that i am noticing over here is that you're having a very strong pullback on the bitcoin dominance
and the reason that i'm mentioning this is because that's not typically when you had find bottoms
so yes, this could be some sort of a local bottom, a minor bottom, but it's not going to be the main bottom within the crypto markets
and that will, i'll have confluence on these levels to show you
so we had, uh, the main liquidity zone over here, which was outlined on the threeday bitcoin chart between 16 700 and 19600
we captured that liquidity, and price is starting to rally up from that zone
so what's going to happen over here? well, this, this would be my best case scenario
if you're bull and you're hoping for, and you want the opium dream over here, your best case scenario is essentially have some sort of a trend line
i'll draw a proper one, but imagine it comes from that side over there, price will shoot back up into this zone over here
and then i pretty much load off and target back into those lows
so we have been expecting that there should be some sort of a relief bounce
but is that time going to be now? well, i'm not so sold on that yet
essentially you're just going to draw your, your main trend line over here
so a mean reversion back to that trend line, i think it's safer to be instead of looking for longs, looking for shorts, waiting for any sort of a test back up to this area, if there is a mean reversion bounce, then, uh, rather short that looking for the next lower low, until the whole trend reverses
and we can take a closer look on the fourhour chart to make a bit more sense of what i'm saying
the on friday and the weekend price action seemed to follow this path over here
i'm gonna clean this up and delete these, but you can see these lines that i drew, i said, there's one of two options
i see a rejection over here, straight off of the 21 ema on the four hour chart
price to come down, lose this midrange level and then target anywhere within this liquidity box between sixteen thousand nine hundred and nineteen eight
so anywhere within that zone, i would anticipate, or probably find some liquidity and bounce
let's just clean this up a bit and then reevaluate, see where we at
as soon as this area happened over here, i drew in a key horizontal area
so you've got the bottom of the range, you've got your top of the range, and then you've got your midrange over here, right? so we recapture the midrange, recapture the 21 ema
maybe if price can start to close a couple of fourhour candles over here
create target back up to the top of the range over there, at 22 800
if you reclaim that 22 800, then you can start to look like this
reclaim the 25 000 level, and then you go for your last leg, and that's 293
you know, i only have limited time on these shows, but why do i not think that this is the ultimate bottom, and ultimately i will be looking for lower prices? well, number one, bitcoin dominance coming down
when you do hit maximum pain and you go to the ultimate bottom, you'll see that bitcoin dominance will shoot through into the roof
so let's just grab that volume over here on this low, very, very low volume
not what you'd expect when you when we got to the lows at 20 000, you had even higher volume than what we currently had at the seventeen thousand dollar level right now
i like to use it for two reasons, as the global open interest, which has kind of come down and almost reset
typically when it does get to these low levels, it does sort of mark some sort of a reset within the market, and that's what you're seeing now
but importantly, the funding rates have not gone negative enough for me to consider that as a macro, major bottom
this essentially also shows once the market goes into some sort of a capitulation type of environment
if you have a look, i know it's small, so probably, for those on a phone, you might be struggling
but essentially what this is showing is also when funding rates go into extreme, extreme negatives, meaning that the majority of market participants are short on the market, looking for much, much lower prices
same way that retail fomo into bull markets, and everybody leverages long at the top, you would expect everybody to leverage short at the bottom
currently we have purple, which is close, but it's not good enough
now, what could set off that sort of a liquidation cascade that could lead into extreme negative funding? well, uh, if you look at ted talks macro on twitter over here, he says, there's not a heap that scheduled events, uh, to drive the market this week
the worst of the bitcoin and equity selling seems over for now
paul speaks on wednesday, thursday, a prepared statement is read, and then there's questions and answers
so maybe some of the journalists could squeeze something out of power that might be negative with regards to future interest rate hikes
and then next week, uh, the events that are due in early july are going to be more key
and that's going to be the fomc minutes, employment data, uacpi
uh, you've got a whole bunch of very, very important decisions that will show the state of the of the market
i know i don't think it's on here, but they should be showing as well, whether the quarterly closes, the quarterly results are going to come in, earnings for all the main uh companies in the world
and then we need to see is, is it going to be officially declared as a recession? because the recession is when you have, um, two quarters back to back that the gdp is declining and negative
and of course, with increased inflation, i think that's where the last cascade or capitulation event could come into place
i don't anticipate that they will come out, uh, stronger than what bitcoin has when we ultimately bottom
uh, just have it on the fourhour chart with my momentum oscillators
look, it's coming into your territory where it could start to flip and target that, uh, 23 800 level
however, the momentum oscillators are looking like they're going to start to turn over, so this could turn out to be a wick on the fourhour candle, and you could see something like this
i haven't ruled this out yet, this could be a possibility that we come back down
the other scenario is that you flip this liquidity zone over here, uh, and you've got your diagonal that's coming, which you've already broken
so come back up, retest that area support, then if you're looking for small, long then you can target back up like that, which is, uh, back to, if i go in this chart over here, you'll essentially be targeting the top side of the range at 22 879
so what's happening with regards to solana? very quickly, solana has got some negative news
basically, they are trying to, uh, withhold, um, certain wales account so that they don't create, like, a mass liquidation
whenever that second leg down comes, or the last and final leg within bitcoin, i would expect that this liquidity zone over at 19 44 will get hit
looking at ethereum, again, we had this main liquidity zone, the bottom liquidity zone, at 757
i'm having a look to see if price makes a lower high relative to this area over here
so if we set in a lower high, ovr, maybe reject off the 50 ema on the fourhour chart, then we'll start to take the next leg down
and i would anticipate, like i said, most of this is probably only gonna tie in in the next ten or so days when, uh, jerome powell speaks and all this data comes out

[Music], i managed to fix the audio bro well then, james, i'm sure there, yes, we'll thank you for that
[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so we talked about in the previous video here for bitcoin, about the potential that the low has now already been in
yeah, i made the channel members aware of that already yesterday, i believe, on telegram discord
but of course, and i have to say that very clearly, because i had a lot of questions, it is still my primary expectation that the low is not in
the reason for that is i'm still missing confirming price action above the 23 295 level
above that i will be able to confirm with a higher likelihood that the low has already been in
for now, i'm just observing, and i'm sketching out a possible breakout scenario, which is as likely as it has not been before in this current, uh, overall bitcoin correction
yeah, this is really the first time in um, seven months that i talk about a potential breakout
you know, we talked about, from december november, we've talked about prices below 286 k, or below 29k, whatever
and this is now the first time that bitcoin has really fulfilled all the requirements
the chart structure at the moment looks completely different to what has happened here
to what has happened here, this was a very clear three wave move up, and then it just moved sideways, and it turned into a larger three wave move, a wxy pattern, and in the end, the triangle
it might not do to you, but, you know, from an elliott wave point of view, it, it makes a bit of a difference
and there is no guarantee that we are going to break out from here
and therefore, as i said to you, i want to see the confirming price action first
and confirming price action for me would be a move, a significant move, above twenty three thousand, two hundred ninety five dollars
will be a move above twenty one thousand three hundred thirty four
to get the confirmation that a low is in, we wanna see an impulsive move up, a three wave move down, basically that abc
and we want to see confirming price action by invalidating a bearish pattern
like in this case, the bearish pattern was this five wave move down
because there is a chance this year the five wave moved down in yellow was only a wave one
then there would be another wave two up, a retracement, basically, and the next move will be an even more bearish wave three down
and in my opinion, it would only be invalidated with a move above 21 334
we touched this target area, yeah, for the wave 2 retracement here in purple
wave 2, in this yellow target area located between 18 800 and 19 600
so my view was that this was an impulsive move up in a wave one
we can count five waves in here, a one, two, three, four, five
and then we would have expected an a, b, c wave still missing
in a zigzag wave, which is a three wave move, you have a wave b that does not retrace that much, so it would be more like that
and then you have a wave c, which is coming down not as steep
so that means what could be coming here is that we're moving a little bit higher in an overshooting wave b, yeah
now, the alternative for that would be that this diagonal has never been finished, and that we have an extended leading diagonal, possible, yeah
so i'm on the lookout here about what this is going to become
now, if it doesn't happen, it will mean that the wave one was never finished
but even then, after the completion of the wave one, we would expect that retracement, which would go into a similar target area
so i need a bit more time to see how this is now unfolding, um, but certainly i would expect a retracement here fairly soon, at the latest
this, in my opinion, will be where a lot of people will have their shorts positioned, because it is the next significant swing high
so i believe here, a lot of people will have their shorts positioned
now, okay, if we just go through here, that would be, if we march through this like butter, that will be a good indication that the low is in
but even if we don't, it is normally what we would expect that we actually see a retracement to the downside and then go through here like butter
because then you would, you would, what would happen next then? yeah
if this here diagonal is finished, we come down in this retracement wave two
the next wave would be a wave three, and that should cut through this here, like, yeah, like, butter really, and reach, ideally here, the next major resistance at 23 295
um, could that be the beginning of the wave c that we still expect? actually, yeah, possibly
so at the moment, my primary expectation, um, well, i need to be careful, as i said, my primary expectation is still that we are not having the bullish breakout
but i am still showing you that bullish scenario because this is what a lot of people are interested in at the moment, and it is certainly what we've been waiting for for a long time
so there is a good case that is currently building here for a potential bullish breakout
but for me, it is still more likely yet that we are not doing this, because i have not yet seen evidence in the chart
i'm still waiting for price action above the levels that i gave you
however, of this, within this bullish scenario, my primary expectation would be that we have completed the wave one here, yeah, that we have done the wave a already, we have done the wave b, maybe now
and that we are now entering the wave c, which would go into this yellow target area, as indicated between eighteen thousand eight hundred and nineteen thousand six hundred dollars
from here, i would expect to turn around in a wave three, in a bullish scenario
now, if we go way below this, it might not be that bullish scenario
and then my primary expectation still remains that we are going further down
but i told you, as soon as it makes sense for me to sketch out and draw out a potential breakout scenario, i will, and you will, you will know it on this channel
if this is the breakout, and if this has been the low at around 17 500, which, by the way, was one of my target areas here, the dotted line, then you will probably have people talking about a possible dead cat bounce until we reach the thirty thousand, forty thousand dollar level
so with that cat bounce means that that jump the dead, the cat jumps and bounces back
so it just means it would be a fake out, that a lot of people will talk about that all the way until we get into the 30, 40k level, because it is so difficult for sentiment to change
it takes such a long time the same way that it seemed impossible for a lot of people that we were getting below thirty thousand dollars again
when i told you for the first time in december, that this is now my primary expectation, that we will reach a target below 286 k, there were so many comments about, we are never going to reach below 30k
but i'm just wanna, i just want to show you how difficult it is and how long it takes for sentiment to change
because if we moved down, um, all the way here, it was even here, a lot of people were challenging me on, you know, you can't say it will go down because this is a running flat pattern, which means correction is finished here around 40, 45k
and i remained true to this perspective that we will come down below 286 k
and only, it seemed like only when we were reaching the 30k level, finally people started to accept that we were in a bear market and that we were correcting down into this price region
now suddenly everybody's talking about 10k, and now it's turning around
and a lot of people find this impossible, the idea of the price reversing back to the upside and getting, possibly, to new alltime highs
and it will take a while until people accept it, if this is the breakout, and it might take until we reach above 50k that people accept it
and then people will jump in way too late, and it might then be, um, already too late, you know
so again, it is just my thoughts on how this sentiment shift is working
you will hear a lot of dead cat bounce, fake out comments and and, you know, shouts of people, which is fine
and maybe it is fake out, but it is, you know, we will keep track of it, and i will always share my honest view with you, you know that

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
we finish off the overall correction, at least we finish off the shorter time frame, elite wave count in making this fifth wave, which i did expect
um, you never know how low that really then, in the end, goes one target for that was the seventeen thousand five hundred dollar level, which we nearly reached
that was a possible turnaround point, just above the six, the seventy, um, uh, seventy six point eight percent fibonacci retracement level, which you can find here, that 169 k
this is a very, very strong support level on the bitcoin chart, generally, for such a wave 2 correction, in which bitcoin is now
so bitcoin made here this wave 1 to the upside, and april 21, came down in the wave b
moved up in a wave b, moved moved down with a up in a b, down in the c we've been talking about the need for bitcoin to move below the low of the wave a
and from that point of view, the scenario was fulfilled, the higher level one
and then we looked at the shorter time frame, elliott wave count in a, in a level of detail that i had not done before, but so far i think it's working out
you know, we had this awful structure here that suggested we would go down again, uh, which we did
then we had this next sideway structure here, also, which suggested we would go down again, which we did
and i've always told you this could be the last wave down five, the fifth wave of the fifth wave of the fifth wave
and this is exactly what, not what happened, necessarily, because we don't have full confirmation yet
and i we have a good case, let's, let's formulate it like that
don't get me wrong, it is not yet my primary expectation because we have not crossed above the 23 to 295 level
a good first indication would be the twenty one thousand, three hundred thirty four dollar level the previous wave, four, high that would be good indication
but confirmation for me, is above this level, which means, you know, it's not 100 guaranteed, but i would make it my primary expectation that we are starting to go up from here
now, what have we seen here? and why am i, you know, at least fairly confident that this could turn around? now, not telling you it will, because we don't have confirmation yet
but what do you need actually for confirmation? so first of all, you need either, um, an impulsive or at least a five wave move
and this is what this looks like, a diagonal, which means it has made five waves, which can overlap, um, in some kind of an ascending wedge pattern in this case
and then in the next wave up, i would want to see prices break, either the price chart break these resistance levels
so, however, what can we do? so, um, what we've seen now is clearer than i think, ever before here
okay? so let me, i'll take that out because it just is a bit too much on the chart
now what are we waiting for? we're now waiting for that wave two
and i think what is important, i saw it on telegram yesterday, a lot of people asking, where would that wave 2 go? now we don't know that, um, until wave 1 is finished
okay, so what? what would make sense? so let's take the look at the the retracement levels here
so we cannot yet say it's it's a faker just because we are going down again, no, because this is what you expect
you expect a five wave move which, in my opinion, is complete now, and then a three wave move down
now if in this move down, we're coming down too far, or we are making a lower low, then that breakout is invalidated
ideally, in that wave 2, we would hit the nineteen thousand one hundred eighty seven dollar level
and i make, well, i'll put the highlighter a target area in so my personal point of view in this case would be anywhere between, difficult to say though
what would be the most likely one for me in this case? well, i think it should be the um
so one thing is um i would still ideally expect it to go into
that would be very much in line with the thirty eight point two percent flip level
now, below that, we've got the other swing low here, which is the wave one top
important is, this is, for me, the most likely retracement area
important is that it ideally does not go below, not seventeen thousand nine hundred forty seven
um invalidation would, however, be seventeen thousand five hundred eighty four
it would just be important not to go below it, because if it goes below it, it will just get more likely that this is not a wave 2 here, yeah, because it just comes a bit too low
you know, technically still possible, but then getting very unlikely
so i put the target wave now here, into this target area, and from here we should then go up in a wave three
or let me just, let's just say here, around about 19200, because we don't know how low the wave 2 really will go
only if we have the wave 2 low in we can calculate the wave 3 high
and based on that, we would expect the wave three high to go to around about twenty four thousand four hundred
and then you can see that as soon as we go above that's twenty one thousand a twenty three thousand, two, nine five level here, it would be good confirmation
so if the next wave up is very long, is very strong, that will be a good indication that we have, that we are on our way out of here
but the case is putting, you know, we can put a case together here
we can put a case together, should we go below seventeen thousand five hundred thirteen, the downtrend will continue
that is the seventy eight point six percent flip level here, i would expect more support um
but if that breaks, yes, then we can go much deeper, much, much lower
and for now we can see, we can be carefully saying that, um, the trend might be changing
and again, i'm not making it my primary expectation yet, only above 23 295 coupled with an impulsive wave structure in wave 3

i was taking a look at solana and just saying, you know, solana is starting to hit a big, major resistance zone
so, you know, we are going to start hitting resistance trendline from these aggressive lower highs
is this the time that we are going to have a reversal moment? we do not really know
you know, could you speculate on shorting this? well, you know, we are seeing the balls having you know, a little bit of steam here
this is either a shorting level from this range, if you're going to have good risk management, you know, you could get heavily rejected from this resistance trend line
but if you do break above this level, we have forty dollars, very likely, largest spike on the vpbr from the last 30 days traded, even more than 30 days, 40 days traded, biggest spike on the vpvr here on um solana is exactly this, forty dollars
so if you do get that breakout, stay cautious, because you're probably going to get rejected from this level
if you do get a solid breakout with the one hourly or, you know, full hourly candle with solid volume, this level is going to be very strong support this 35 very well respected
you break out, you have a great, great longing opportunity right there, at least to the six, one, eight from the drop
okay, you do not know if you're going to create a double top, a slightly lower high, or you're gonna break above it, but you need to take a look at the high probability zones where you could get that bounce
so if solana does break above this range, you are very likely going to get one kind of bounce from this major, big level
i'm explaining the exact same scenario that happened right over here
you already start getting out from the 618 of the drop, because you might create a double chop and come back down, just like we're doing right now, as a double bottom
only trade that i would have taken here is this one, to down this level
you only need one trade a week, or, you know, one trade a month, or, depending i make about, you know, five, in between five and 15 trades a month
and, um, yeah, with just a few trades, you know, you you make the month
so anyway, let me just go through the comment section, taking a look at solana here, looking at those high probable zones where we could get those bouncers
let's take a look at the dxy, is it forming a cup and handle? apecoin, we can also take a look at
uh, you know, potentially forming this kind of double bottom scenario, creating a big spike on the vpvr
um, a big, big, solid level on a coin is this one right over here
you could get that volatility hitting these levels, big spike on the vpvr
you could get that momentum on apecoin to the upside right away
double bottom, retesting this 550 range, where you could get that heavily heavy, um, heavy rejection
we take a look at fib levels from this high to the low, 50, 618
you want to potentially be looking for shining opportunities in between this, you know, 550 range, 570 590
could get that volatility, uh, in the next coming days, if it does come up there, you know, the probabilities in coming up right now is very, very high with this double bottom
would be absolutely beautiful to see that consolidation at this level
and between 520 and 590, you know, consolidation at this range with volatility confirming the bullish exhaustion, ready to, uh, you know, form that mountain that roll back down
what's happening with bitcoin? i mean, all depending with bitcoin
i am going to, i am going to place a short right now on bitcoin
you could get a slight leg up here and a little bit of volatility
um, let me just take a look here one second, guys, because we are looking for good trading opportunities and having very good risk management
you know, you could, you could get that pump up here to the twenty thousand seven hundred, twenty thousand eight hundred again, and have that leg down, maybe that six one eight from this potential drop, and then have the drop
this is, or i can already see that the price is getting pretty exhausted
let's take yeah, i'm going to take that short right right away
um, the only thing i'm considering here, the only thing i'm considering here is, um, i've got a 29 x 49 x here
i'm gonna risk not even, not even one percent of my capital here for this short position
it does look like that we could get rejected, rejected, and continue down
this is the kind of trading opportunity that i want to take a look at
if i do get stopped out, then, yeah, it's not much of a deal because, um, you're not risking too much, you know, right? you're not, you're not risking too much
now, is there a possibility that we're gonna break up? yeah, yeah, there is
but i think there's a high probability in getting rejected from this big spike on the bpvr, we just already hit the six one eight levels
i'm risking only a very tiny percent of my portfolio, of my capital, six one eight from this drop, big spike on the vpvr, you got confirmation of the exhaustion here
probabilities, and coming down now in the next coming hours, is just very high, in my opinion
um, do i have a bad throat? what is the take profit? what's the take prop? yeah, i have a bad throat
mark dutch, how are you doing, my man? thanks for joining the stream again
from the short position where i would be aiming, i would be aiming, um, at least to round about the 50, from the low here to the high 50 percent
we could have a large consolidation the next coming weeks, thanks to the weekly close, and thanks to the dxy
the weekly yesterday closed well above all right? last week we did have the price coming below eighteen thousand dollars, breaking the alltime high
we got the news, we got twitter, bitcoin breaking alltime high
in the bear cycle, we nev we never broke the alltime high resistance zone
you know, we probably retested it did below, and it's probably going to be held for the next coming weeks
so this is why, you know, this major drop, you know, if we do get that drop right now on bitcoin, um, i don't think it will come all the way down here and successfully break down, might be holding a percentage of my uh, of my cap, of my uh position, if we do manage to go to 50, to that 194 approximately, i will be holding some just in case you do get that leg down to retest the lows
so, of course, this is, if i do not get stopped out, i will be starting to protect my position here
as soon as we start breaking below twenty thousand dollars, you know that nineteen point seven, the three eight
you cannot have a trade in the profit coming down to certain support levels and you still have your stop loss here without protecting your position and then getting stopped out while you were in huge profits
you you could not afford to do this, you know, because this is, you know, this is irresponsible trading
you cannot be in pretty nice profits and not getting protected, because you could get that scenario happening on bitcoin
uh, what did i get here from someone? can we, uh, take a look at, uh, btc dumping
are we gonna manage to dump harder? i mean, this is, this is what i mean
i'm still not going to say that this is going to be a successful trade, but this is the kind of trade that i want to get into
wait for confirmation, wait for that kind of double top swing failure, and get hop in a trade when you're seeing bearish exhaustion, it just gives you more probabilities for a successful trade
now, can this do this? yes, and i get stopped out? yeah, of course
for you guys remember extreme fear, uh? it's just gonna be here for a while
let's take a look at metis, where we do our medics, finding kind of a flaw
it's, yeah, in my opinion, it's at very, very good buying levels at this moment
this kind of price action is already telling me that, you know, the bottom is close, not that the bottom is in, that the bottom could be potentially closed for metis
yeah, i think this is one of those altcoins that i do still hold on my portfolio
i'm at a huge loss from the 50 percent of my medicinal that i did buy
so, yeah, i'm actually in a profit on on medici and i'm probably gonna buy up some metas or with some stable coins, uh, the next coming weeks
this is one of those project l2 is, i think, you know, most of the projects are built on the ethereum network, guys? well, i would say 70, even 80
how many projects are built on solana on ada? on cadena, on, you know, all of these different ones
you know what is it? star atlas is built on the solana blockchain
but ethereum still will be number one for the next five years, in my opinion
so l2s such as matic network, despite the massive bear market, they're gonna be huge
it went well above two, three dollars, which was absolutely insane
it's just going to be so, so boring that this is going to be looking like it's dead
you know, the best chart you can take a look at here, when ada was dead, this was dead cycle of 2017
and guess what? guess what happens after you get a massive, huge pump to the upside in, you know, less than one year
but it's just going to be, there's going to be a big, massive flush out
there's going to be a nice flush out crap projects, meme coins staying close to zero, or even some to zero, some getting kind of bankrupt, right? the team not managing due to to continue with marketing and continue paying part of the team
and it's just gonna be happening for a lot, a lot of the projects
might take, you know, a couple of years till we see that next big cycle
of course, if we follow the market cycle and harvenings, it should be around about 2025, approximately when we should be having another hype
but, yeah, medistar is one of those that i do think will be looking boring in the next coming, uh, you know, months
and it, it's one of those l2s that is important for the ethereum network
and this is kind of the end of the bearish cycle trend, and you are going to start finding the floor levels for the next few months
and that is when i'm going to say, guys, floor is in, you know, dollar cost average
of course, if you want to know shortterm analysis, i think, you know, looking at the shortterm analysis, you know, bigger relief rally is very, very likely
you know, you can see here that we are rounding off from this aggressive downtrend
you can expect some big relief rallies on metis dao the next coming weeks
i will be locking profits very, very fast as soon as if we do dip below 20 000 and start hitting 197, 195, i will be locking profits and protecting my position very, very fast
there's something about the dxy that i do think it can continue lower the next coming days
there is something about this that is telling me that this is coming lower
so, and a reason why i'll be locking profits also in this major drop is because of this weekly close
this means that you could get a few retesters, a few retests of the 18 000 range, but not successfully breaking down
major weekly from the alltime high, major consolidation weekly also from december of 2020 and november
you could get a few recess sideways, action, big relief rallies at these at this range, guys, so many, many opportunities
don't think that if you're shorting that we are going down to the 14k
this is the time that we are getting rejected, and we are going down to to 12k
no, i think we're gonna, probably going to be range trading for for a few weeks here
this is how you add up your your capital by the end of the month
divergence on the daily is that the are the, are they bearish divergence? very likely
i mean, it's pretty impressive because, uh, divergence on the dxy have played out very, very well in the past
but, yeah, you can see that they, you know, we are creating those bearish diversions, where we are getting the rsi creating lower highs
a lot of things to take into consideration here with the market, guys
um, that weekly, uh, close on on on bitcoin was pretty, pretty powerful
sad thing about xrp, we are at bear bear market lows from, you know, 2019, 2019, 2018, 2020, we are at bear market lows
i don't think xrp will die, but, um, it's going to be boring price action for many, many, many, many months
we are already, you know, if you are bullish on xrp, these are accumulation levels
they were accumulation levels back in 2019, until 2020, then you start, you had that pretty nice run up
okay, it didn't even do a 10x, which was pretty sad i did about a 10x
but xrp, guys, yeah, if you want to make, if you want to make huge gains, i don't think xrp is the one, you know, you will make gains
of course, next cycle it's going to be ma x hoppy has been incredibly boring
i think xrp will be doing, you know, a lot of boring price action for the next couple of months
you want to take a look at short term analysis, you know, also, like i said, vpvr here
most of the accumulation level on xrp has been at these ranges
so this is how you can see the the difference on on the, on the trend on bitcoin than all coins
you could much, much more powerful um bitcoin than all coins, of course
this is very likely going to be accumulating levels for the next coming months on xrp
if we take a look at the four hourly chart, zoom in a little bit
are we going to create some relief rallies here on xrp? yeah, very possible
we are creating these, uh, bullish divergence here on the full hourly chart, creating higher lows on the rsi, lower lows on the price action
expect some kind of relief rally, larger relief rally here on on xrp
um, potentially, potentially, potentially to the strongest level here, which would be this low area, value area, low on the vpvr low range here
and, yeah, you are looking for that, you know, six one eight levels from this consolidation top to the bottom
i think we could reach those levels, um, in the next coming weeks
it will be, um, all coins will be making the same kind of move
would i short this? no, because this could be an easier double bottom, and we're going to break out
if we do get a successful breakout, a quick, quick long at least to the 618 from the drop
but i don't short second or third retests, especially when you have this formation
what's going on with the eth? what's going on with ethereum? ethereum, low or high? i mean, very very possible
and, you know, looking at the logarithmic chart, okay, logging logarithmic chart with trend lines, and not the ideal scenario, but looking at ethereum on the four hourly, it was pretty impressive
here how we actually broke this resistance trend line of lower highs
this is the only time i've done it, but not on the logarithmic
looking at the logarithmic, you know, it was pretty much respected
this low here, one thousand, uh, one thousand eighty dollar range, approximately one thousand sixty
we broke the resistance trend line, got above this major support and got that bounce
we broke out, consolidated break out the range, absolutely beautiful
there is one i want to trade here is where i want to take my trade at the retest, to retest at least the 618, or potentially the highest i would have, i would have taken profits already on this, um, on this trade at the 618
because you might create a lower high here and come back down
the opportunity here on ethereum was early this morning, central european time
you know, that consolidation from that support level, that has turned into support, that resistance level, sorry, here, also, resistance support has turned here very nicely
mark dutch says, thank you very much, my man, for that insane support
would you take a look? uh, mighty tour says, would you take a look at moonbeam? glmr, and possibly polkadot
i have been taking that look at polka dot within this live stream and also the other live stream
this one has been in such such an aggressive drop it's absolutely insane
we just lost the lows from may, had a big, intensive drop, and it seems like we could get some kind of relief rally from these levels
this is, you know, if we do have any large relief rallies here on moonbeam hitting the 110, for example, in the next coming weeks, it's going to be looking for a shorting opportunity
i do think that if we do come up to this 77, 77, 78 level, look for that potential rejection here, 618 fib level from the drop
this is heavily in a downtrend, no signs of reversing anytime soon
it's still very aggressively in a downtrend, looking for those potential relief rallies
i remember nano was in the top 20, even the top 10, uh, four or five years ago
yeah, i remember nano back in, i remember, in 2018 is when i got into crypto, but i remember checking out, you know, nana was a very famous one on the ball run
it went from just about 15 cents in november, in january, all the way up to 31, even higher
that's over, well over a 200 x absolutely insane in two months
many of the old coins that are in the top 50 next cycle will not, they will not break alltime highs
thanks for the ta, on ada, man, big fan of your ta, says chris, well, thank you very much
just looking at, you know, major levels, uh, high probability zones
um, we are getting a little bit of pumpy action here again on bitcoin
you know, is this? are we gonna finally get rejected? i'm staying cautious here
you know, this, we've had such a strong weekly close, and this weekly close is very, very important
i'll tell you what, if this shorting opportunity does fail, if we solidly break out from this range and come back down, it's very, very likely going to hold this
expect the uptrend that we that we'll create if we solidly break above this level, expect it to continue and go sideways and get rejected here for the next coming weeks
this weekly close on bitcoin has a lot of significant, okay? a lot, a lot of significant, dropping below the oldtime high
everybody's saying that we've broken, you know, the alltime high
we never dipped below, even retested the alltime high from the last cycle
all right? it's, you know, panic mode right now in the crypto space
most of the people are thinking that we are going to go down to 12k
this is very much levels that you want to dollar cost average in just in case you don't successfully break down 19k
huge noise i bet you can hear it, i will probably be doing live streams in afternoons instead of mornings
and i will be doing a video update in the mornings and probably live streams in evenings
and on buyback, you get up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus

you got all the free information and social or all our socials down below
how is everyone doing? i hope you're having a fantastic monday
check out the major weekly close that we did have yesterday sunday
we went all the way up to twenty thousand five hundred dollars, managed to close that weekly
we are going to go through the charts right away and look for those opportunities monday today
markets are closed today, i've heard, so maybe there's not going to be that much volatility
but we can see that major weekly close above this weekly close from december of 2017, managing to hold that range, as you can see, just having that volatility below this 19 400 major weekly close, managing to close yesterday above this range
we had a excellent rally all the way up yesterday before the actual close
now right now there is potentially a very, very good trading opportunity, but i am still waiting on the sidelines, because this is the moment
we are in between 50 and 618 fibonacci retracement from this high peak over here to the low
we are currently at that fibonacci important level, just above 50, almost going to hit the six, one, eight
and this is the moment i am going to pull the trigger, basically, for a potential short opportunity
i'm not in any short, no long, no trades at all on on bitcoin um
i am waiting patiently to see, is this runup that we are having right now, the last couple of hours, is it going to successfully break above here, this huge, major resistance
why is this such a huge resistance? because we do have a big spike on the vpvr from the volume trader
we have the biggest point in control, just exactly where we are trading at right now, the twenty thousand five hundred dollar range
we were talking about this major level yesterday, that if we do have a successful breakout from this level, it is very, very likely that we might be continuing this uptrend, okay, this small uptrend that we have been creating from yesterday
and this is the moment that you are potentially going to create a double top, are you going to create a swing failure pattern? and there is the moment that you need to step in as a trader to see where is the highest probability, where how low can we go if we do get rejected from the zone? what is going to be your risk management? are you going to risk, you know, a small amount to potentially gain at least three times more of what you're risking? but this is what we are going to wait for in this live stream
hopefully, hopefully, we're going to see the price pumping right now, hitting, i don't know, seven hundred, twenty thousand eight hundred, even twenty one thousand dollars, hitting that six, one, eight, six, five, getting that rejection and seeing the next candlesticks closing below this twenty thousand eight hundred range, the high that we did create here yesterday night here central european time
if we do get that fail guys, this is going to be looking like a double top scenario, swing failure
ready to have that rejection for potentially continuing back down
but i am not in a short trade at this moment, because this is the moment, in the next few hours, that we are probably going to see a successful breakout, guys
it's a major level where we could get heavily rejected, kind of the value area high of this zone
but if we do get a solid breakout from this range, start consolidating, this big, major level will very likely hold as support
and then this is very likely that this major, big zone right over here, as you can see, this is around about that twenty thousand five hundred dollar range where we could get that explosive breakout
it's a solid, solid level, as you can see here in the past, reacting as support, also reacting as resistance
there are some big, major opportunities here on, uh bounce, okay, to make scalp day trade, or, depending it's very likely going to be a day trade, or even a small swing trade, because it might take some time to actually recover
if we do fail in this hour or the next hour, having an attempt to break this high and fail, it's very, very likely going to get rejected, guys
and this is the kind of opportunity that we want to take a look at
we talked about this many, many times for the last few weeks, the breakdown from this major support of this parabolic run that we've had for the last few months on the dxy dx, while absolutely exploding, we were analyzing the situation for the dollar index, saying, you know, there will be a moment that this has to lose steam
there will be a moment that the dxy will start correcting heavily
and there will might, will probably have a good side effect on bitcoin
so we got that retest from this trend line here to perfection, as you can see right over here, perfect retest
if we do zoom in on the four hourly, we got that consolidation, created a solid floor level
xy broke down, came back up, had that volatility, it got rejected as resistance from this level
so the potential scenario here of retesting this low on the dxy the next few days
and this is going to have a very good effect on bitcoin, very likely
so if we take a look at, you know, also, it's been hitting that 618 level, 61865, also big support level, got rejected
if it does continue down, you might see bitcoin successfully breaking up above this range right now
so you can actually, you know, if the, if the bitcoin price does look kind of bullish, or is going to break a major resistance, dxy can help you to find out, you know, is that push, is that leg up, going to be possible? and just by looking at the dxy, it is very, very, very possible
is this the moment that we are gonna break? or are we going to fail? guys? if this leg up fails, i will be entering a short right here, live with you guys
if it does doesn't fail, and it starts continues pumping, we wait
okay, let's see if we do get that one more leg up, maybe to 21, 21k
if we do get that rejection from this zone, i am shorting live, because it does need a big amount of power to break this resistance zone, guys
could be an absolute failed attempt to enter a potential short after this runup that we did have yesterday
most importantly, i just want to give you my opinion here, guys
we're going to wait patiently, because, you know the deal, look at the dxy
it is looking weak at this moment, and it could start falling the next few days, guys
you know, i just cannot, uh, you know, i could not be bearish on bitcoin if the dxy looks like it potentially will have a pretty aggressive corrective move
um, so let's just wait and see to see what kind of reaction we do have right now on bitcoin, because we will be probably doing a live short right now
currently in between 50 618 fib levels, from this high to the lows
if you want to be a successful trader, you need to wait to see how we react at big levels
if you do not get that rejection right now, this is going to absolutely skyrocket and continue to the upside um
i mean, if you want to take the risk right now, it can happen
you tight stop loss above this range because, i mean, i want confirmation
i don't mind getting into trade here, waiting for confirmation of weakness
if you are an aggressive trader, and you do think that you're gonna have that, um, full swing failure pattern
uh, rejection from this level, that 21k range here with b we have the second spike on the vpvr
we kind of, it looks like we are going to come down in the next coming days on the dxy
it is a risky trade, but you do have a very, very solid level here where you could place your stop loss above this resistance zone
this is the thing, you know, this is the moment you might get exhausted, and this is ready for that correction
i'm gonna wait, uh, the next 28 minutes to see how this one hourly closes
because if this one hourly closes above this range, bitcoin will might be gaining some steam and continue to the upside
uh, find you a girl who looks at you like andy looks at chain link
um, should i take tp now? should i take profit now? uh, uh? jillian, well, i'm not sure what you're trading, so, uh, if you're longing, if you're shorting, i don't know
chris, how are you copying handle on the full hourly chart? okay, i can see something
i mean, we do have that solid support level, uh, we do have this round formation, and this the handle
um, it's not the best looking one, but you could arguably discuss that
on the two hourly chart, right? copying handle, it does look like something like that
you want this kind of formation and then a break up, not at the lowest part of a downtrend
so, anyway, on the four hourly, the four hourly looks even better
if you take a look at the four hourly chart, guys, look at the look at this
you're hitting just the lows here from the four hourly, close from the 14th of june
and, uh, yeah, basically the 14th of june, you have a close, end open
vpvr, vpvr, this is a level where you could get that volatility and come back down, guys
so, i mean, this is probably going to get rejected from this zone
very, very probably it's going to get rejected big v pvr levels
shall we take the short? shall we take the short? if we take a look at the lows to the highs um where could we have that corrective move at least to the 50 percent? 19 300? yeah, let's wait
let's wait and see if we do consolidate at this range next coming a couple of hours
and like i said, if we do move down on bitcoin, i am looking for, you know, not a successful breakdown from this range
we've had an insane weekly close here, meaning that, you know, consolidation and, you know, relief rallies and sideways action is very, very possible
consolidation, relief rallies before continuing back down, is very, very possible
you know, this is where we can get pretty huge gains, no matter what direction bitcoin goes
so it does look like we could have a little bit of range trading the next coming days, during the week
and this is where we want to find the strongest resistance levels to take those, you know, potential trades right now
even, okay, are we going to get rejected? come back down, have a leg down before we probably continue back up
we'll be, you know, potentially, you know, looking for that short, looking for those opportunities
it does look like that we are probably going to be finding this nice shorting opportunity on bitcoin
shall we short the market? shall we short the market? uh, this is what i am looking for
this is what i am looking for, failed top here, and potentially come down to around about the 13, sorry, 19 400 range, maybe between today and tomorrow
if this 15minute candle closes like this, um, we're probably entering the short, just to do the short
nano, hello, uh, he will come by spanish time, says naveen, exactly
how are you doing? mark dutch, thank you very much for joining the livestream
uh, trying to go through a lot of the um comment section, but yeah, short
this does look like it is potentially going to be a shorting opportunity
okay, you know, this is the moment you want to short at an uptrend coming from a downtrend, hitting big resistance levels
it looks like we are going to get rejected very, very lightly
i would like to see that one hourly close, which, which is happening in 20 minutes, big resistance levels
do you mean a head and shoulder formation? probably we are forming the head right now, and we're gonna have this
um, still very, very soon to say, but this is looking like a very good shorting opportunity
if we have, you know, the next hour, the next hour, candle doing this, you know, and i missed out on shorting
this is still the attempt of the bulls trying to break resistance
if they have failed, will it be likely that they fail? i think so
i think there's a high probability that the the balls are going to fail
this major, big zone breakout where we do have large consolidation, large vpvr levels
if we do get that volatility, i will be, you know, ready to add to my position
i might be risking, uh, 05 or 1 on my portfolio, um, on my portfolio, of my capital
i do see a bullish gauntlet pattern here on the german stock market
we've got christine lagarde, the central european bank president, is having a speech today at three o'clock, central european time
of course, europe uh, central uh european bank doesn't have that much effect in the market
but of course, it's not the same when jerome powell comes, okay, with interest rates, or the funk meeting
we got important european news today, christine lagarde speech at three o'clock
so, um, is this going to be bullish or bearish? what i can see here on the um, um, the dax market
okay, the german stock market is that we do have a very, very solid support level right now
we are currently sitting at one of the strongest support levels from the last five to six years
and what i can see here on the german stock market, and i might be long in this in between today and tomorrow
and there is actually a pretty nice, there's a pretty nice bullish gauntlet pattern right over here
if you guys can see, hitting to perfection right now, that seven eight, okay? that seven eight fibonacci retracement from this low to the high
seven eight, okay? seven eight, seven nine, which is the, which is the bullish gauntlet, you know, level to have that potential bounce, at least to the 618 from this drop
in between today and tomorrow, i'll be, uh, potentially opening that long all depending on three o'clock
will we have bullish news from christine lagarde, central european bank president? um, i think so
it's, maybe, we are, maybe gonna have some bullish news for the stock market, for the german stock market in europe
but i'm very much, very interested in having a short term long position for this week on the dx1 on the dxy on the dax market
okay, i know this is a crypto channel, but we can also take a look at, you know, traditional stock markets, uh? and if they are very important, also to see if there is going to be some bullishness
of course, stock market is bullish, it's gonna help the bitcoin and crypto market
so, um, yeah, this can be traded on primex bt, german stock market
good thing about this that they do use bitcoin ethereum, stable coins as collateral, which is absolutely amazing
you do need kyc if you're going to start, you know, using a very large amount of volume
i've still got some open, okay, on natural gas and crude oil, just because i do see a little bit more downside action
of course, despite crypto, we can do, um, the super chat, bro let's take a look at the super chat right away
what is a good area to buy bitcoin? what is a good area to buy bitcoin? well, we've been talking about on the channel, we are at the strongest support level right now, which is that nineteen twenty thousand dollars
why is it nineteen and twenty? because we have, you know, the weekly close at nineteen thousand four hundred
okay, um, daily closes at nineteen thousand four hundred dollar range
and if we do not break this zone, which we do, have a nice consolidated, uh, consolidation here in november of 2020, december
as you can see here on the chart, we've also got the alltime high
whoever thinks that cannot hold for the next coming week, well, i think is, he's foolish
can it break? it also? yeah, of course, we need to take a look at both sides, but there is a high probability also, of holding the range, maybe for the next coming weeks, having a consolidation before we break down
if we do break down this 19 000 range and start closing daily candles below this range, and also even a weekly candle, okay, hitting 17 16, you know, 14 000 is in the cards, no doubt about that
so if we start breaking the only kind of big support that we do have right now, which is this 1920k levels, as soon as we have the second attempt and start breaking the lows, you know, the probabilities in coming down to 14 12 k is just very high
we need to take advantage of that leg down once we break this level
so we got bitcoin getting that heavy rejection from this level
are you going to manage to risk just a small amount? okay? even above this wick, probably once we close the one hourly it might be a good, good level to place a stop loss, um, because we want to have tight stop losses here
if we do get that one leg up, okay, on the next candle, it's going to be very, very good for a potential short to have very good risk management
uh, we are at least aiming for that nineteen thousand four hundred dollars, which would be the fifty percent fib level from this po from this pump
[Music] and this major zone over here, at least that level, um
if we, if we close above this resistance zone, then it's still going to be looking pretty good for bitcoin
uh, what area is good to buy bitcoin? will it burat? thanks for the super chat
a good area to why bitcoin is always right now, especially in this heavy, heavy downtrend
yeah, just around about the 18 000 levels, i did buy some bitcoin
so dollar cost average, my man, you will never catch the bottom and buy everything
you know, you might buy some at the bottom, wherever it is, but you will have, you know, you, you know, dollar cost average is the best thing you can do
i'm actually just putting a little bit on bitcoin ethereum, every single week right now
i'm not waiting with all of my bag to say, once we hit 10k, i'm gonna put 100 on my ustc and usdt into bitcoin
because i don't know if we are really going to reach those 12k levels
if we reach there, i will have some spare, stable coins to add up on bitcoin
you will get an average price of whatever volatility happens on bitcoin for the next coming months
it's a, i'm not going to say it's a silly question, but i, i, you know, you can't stress this enough to everyone, dollar cost average
it's the most effective and most simple strategy that you can, um, you can apply
and obviously, i'm, i do say this a lot, but if i do get people asking me this question, i will answer this
can you have a look to see where i can take profit? well, let's take a look at some you are longing from point forty four
we were talking about the 044 yesterday, that it was going to be a solid, solid, it's a solid support level
if you are longing from this range, i would protect position if you i've got a stop loss here below this range
you know, these this is already a level that you need to protect your position because, um, yeah, you can't have your stop loss here still
if you, you, if you do have a stop loss from this long area, wrong position
because what if the price rolls down? you get stopped out, just because you were waiting patiently for this range, this trade
either you take some profits right now, close 50 percent, 40 60, you do protect your position and wait for that next leg up to the next major resistance zone, which for me is the 51 level, uh, sorry, the 51 cent level
if you are trading, scalping day trading, small swing trading
uh, i would be, you know, looking for this level here for a a potential rejection, because this does look like a double bottom
this is looking pretty good for that, for that retest double bottom
also, right over here on encelada, we got rejected here pretty nicely from this
uh, you could argue, discuss, that's a descending triangle scenario
that there is the probabilities on on, on dot, to come up here to the four dollar
this might have a quick leg up the next coming hours to that 860 level, especially if bitcoin does behave it does have a relief rally, or depending on bitcoin also, it's all depending on bitcoin
if we see bitcoin getting heavily rejected and coming down, yeah, even though this does look like like a double bottom, and we could get that leg up if bitcoin starts getting rejected, comes down to the 19 000 range, again, yeah, stay cautious because, uh, very likely the old coins will not manage to to to make this this popup
so you might get that leg up and hit this level, which is the 86870
looking at the vpvr, looking at big support levels, getting that bounce, that resistance there
you've got the trend line, you've got the trend line, you've got vpvr, you've got support support
on polka dot, of course, i would be analyzing bitcoin first, or depending on what bitcoin does

my name is josh, and this will just be a quick update video today, but i'll still be covering some important points, such as the net unrealized losses for bitcoin jumping into a new high
and i will also be covering what's just confirmed on the chart for both bitcoin and ethereum, and where ethereum's next move could be
so you might as well stick around to the end of this video so that you don't miss out on any of this important information
and over the past one day, we've just seen a weekly candle close, which has actually cemented the weekly rsi in place
and with this recent weekly candle close, we have now confirmed the most oversold the rsi has ever been for bitcoin on the weekly timeframe
throughout bitcoin's entire price history, we've never seen the rsi get this low
in fact, the bitcoin rsi on the weekly timeframe has only ever entered oversold territories just two other times throughout bitcoin's entire price history, up until recently
and if you're looking at the other two times where we saw the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories, that was basically a time in the market where we saw maximum opportunity and somewhat limited downside price action
but keep in mind, this is a very longterm indicator, not an immediate shortterm indicator
but other than the weekly kettle close and cementing the weekly rsi in place, not much has changed over the past one day
and so to avoid wasting your time, i'll just be covering all of the new things that happened over the past one day in this video, keeping it nice and quick
and if you're a brand new viewer on this channel, check out my video yesterday on the channel to get up to date with what i'm covering in this video
and now, giving you a quick update on this on chain, bitcoin charts, looking at these two indicators, these two lines right here they are coming in very close to the bitcoin price, and they're also getting very close to crossing over
and once again, if you want more detail about this chart, check out my video yesterday on the channel
but basically, the main thing you need to know about this chart right here is, looking at the two previous bitcoin bear markets, we saw the bitcoin price in both of those significant bear markets retrace down to these lines, in fact, slightly below those lines
and the bear market, in terms of when it actually bottomed out, it bottoms out when these two lines crossed over, when the pink line crossed above the orange line
and looking at the present day, we're getting very close to that happening, but we haven't seen it just yet
and it's now giving you an update on this other bitcoin on chain charts i've been talking about over the past few days, which is the net unrealized losses for bitcoin
and in fact, over the past couple days, what we've seen in this chart right here is the net unrealized losses spike to a new high, a higher high, from the march 2020 crash
because if you're looking back at that march 2020 capitulation, that was one of the most severe crashes throughout bitcoin's history, we actually crashed around 50 in one single day
and right at the bottom of the march 2020 crash, we saw the net unrealized losses spiked to around 49 to 50, which meant, at that stage in the market, roughly around half of all bitcoin was sitting in a loss from when it last moved
but if you're looking at the recent spike in the net unrealized losses, this has gotten to a high of around 56 to 57, which means at that highest point right there, which is when the bitcoin price dropped down towards 17 to 18 000, around 56 to 57 of the bitcoin supply was sitting in a loss from when it last moved on chain
so what this tells us is we've seen a huge capitulation, and we're basically in that capitulation territory at the moment, somewhat similar to march 2020
but once again, if you want more information on this important chart right here, check out some of my recent videos here on the channel
and it's now giving you a quick update on the 12hour bitcoin chart
and right now we still have these active bullish divergence in play here on the 12 hour charts
but what is different today that we did not see yesterday is a bullish cost in the 12hour bitcoin macd
and in fact, this has now been confirmed with one 12hour kindle close, and potentially another 12 hour candle close in a few hours from now, if we don't see a major dump within the next few hours
now i want to make it clear that even though we have a bullish divergence and a bullish cost in the macd, this does not mean we're going to play out extremely bullish price action
what this means is basically, we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, at least in the short term, like what we saw back here around a month ago
we saw quite a lot of bearish momentum in early may, and then we formed this bullish divergence between the price action and the rsi on the 12 hour chart
and then what we saw after that bullish divergence was a bullish cross in the 12 hour bitcoin macd
and what came next was a lot of sideways price action, once again, reduced bearish momentum
so based on all of that, one of the most likely scenarios moving forward, at least in the short term, talking about the next few days or so is simply some choppy sideways price action somewhat similar to what we saw in the second half of may
and now getting into the ethereum parts of this video, this right here is the weekly ethereum to yours dollar chance
and right now we're still holding above that 382 fibonacci level coming into play at around 1050
and here on the weekly charts, if you're looking at the weekly candle closes, we never actually confirmed a break below that level, because, of course, we just confirmed the weekly candle close over the past one day
and that weekly candle close was at around 1 100, approximately just above 11 k
so honestly, considering everything that happened in crypto over the past one week, the weekly kennel close actually wasn't too bad, especially because we formed a massive wick to the downside with huge volume, as i discussed more in yesterday's video
and as i said towards the beginning of this video, on the weekly bitcoin chant, we have now confirmed the weekly rsi in place on the ethereum chart as well, of course
and if you're zooming out further on the weekly ethereum charts, the only other time where we've seen the weekly ethereum rsi enter into oversold territories was at the end of the 2018 bear market, because, of course, ethereum wasn't even around for the 2014 bear market
and if you're looking at the bottom of the 2018 bear market, at that stage, the rsi actually confirmed at around 284, which was the lowest level in the weekly ethereum rsi for a very long time, up until the most recent weekly candle close, where we saw the rsi confirm at around 263
so technically speaking, ethereum here, on the weekly time frame is the most oversold we have ever seen throughout ethereum's entire price history, right now
and just giving you a quick update on the shortterm ethereum price action here on the 12hour chart
and obviously, this is a very similar situation to the 12hour bitcoin chart, where we still have this active bullish divergence i've been talking about over the past one to two days
but what we have now seen on this chart right here, over the past one day, is actually two confirmations for this bullish cost in the 12hour ethereum macd
and once again, we saw something very similar roughly around a month ago, where we basically saw a lot of bearish momentum in early may
and then we saw a bullish divergence form between the ethereum price action and the ethereum rsi on the 12hour time frame
and not long after that bullish divergence confirmed, we then saw a bullish cross in the 12hour ethereum macd
and once again, what came next for ethereum was simply reduced bearish momentum, mostly choppy, sideways price action
so moving forward, especially over the next few days or so, just talking about the shorter term, that is what i'm expecting as the most likely scenario moving forward
and over here on the ethereum versus bitcoin charts on the weekly time frame, not much has happened over the past one day, other than, of course, the weekly candle close where we did actually see our first green weekly candle in over a month
and of course, we still have this upper training line of support intact, coming into play at around 0049 bitcoin per ethereum
but other than that, nothing much has changed over the past one day
so once again, if you want to know more information about this chart, just here, check out my last video on this channel
and if you want to know how to maximize your profits in crypto
check out this video popping up right here to find out how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
in today's episode, we're going to be talking about the mvrv z score
now, this is another beautiful chart that will help us identify periods where bitcoin is extremely overvalued or undervalued relative to its fair value
this is simply the current bitcoin price multiplied by the number of coins circulating
we then have the realized value, which is this orange line, uh, just underneath this chart
and if we want to look at the realized price, we can see this is basically the exact same chart, just plotting the actual price of bitcoin and the realized price
now, the realized value, which, once again, is this orange line floating through our chart, is simply the price of each bitcoin when it was last moved
it adds up all the individual prices of all those bitcoins when they were last moved
and it takes the average of them, and it multiplies that average by the circulating supply
and if you want to look at the formula of how to get the mvrv zed score, you can simply see it here
dollar terms, divided by its standard deviation, times the market cap in us
now, what you will notice, mainly, i want to talk about the z score for this chart, and then we can move over to the realized price
because this is a very simple metric to help us understand, you know, when the majority of people are in profit, when the majority of people are not in profit
if we start off with the zscore, you can see the zscore, or the zscore, which is plotted by this red line on the chart
and so far this has had data points taking in ranges between 1003 all the way down to the lows we've got down here at minus that
and what you will notice is, whenever this does dip into this green zone down here, it pretty much always correlates to the bottom
so whenever the zscore goes down to these massive capitulation levels, and it capitulates below one, or rather, it capitulates below zero, which you can see over on the right side of the yaxis over here, labeled mvrv score
uh, what you can see is, like i said, every time we come down to this green box, this is normally the capitulation zone
and this is, once again, another metric to help us identify these market bottoms and market tops within the cycle
all i really want to say is, it's, it's fairly obvious when you see these massive blow off tops on the mvrv, uh, the mvrv
so i will be looking at this in the future to help us navigate the tops of the cycle
but at this moment in time, we would be looking for the bottom of the cycle rather than the top
and what you can see two metrics that we do have to help us identify that we are very near the bottom
is, number one, the fact that the mvrv z score has capitulated down to the level of 025
and what i would also like to highlight with this is it does seem like we have higher lows on the mvrv
so, for example, uh, in the 2011 bear market, we came down to a z score of minus 067
coming into the 2014 bear market, or 2015, rather, we had a zscore of minus 049
coming into the 2018 capitulation, we have minus 047, which, once again, is a slight higher low
coming into the 2020 pandemic, we were assessing a valuation of minus 016
are we looking at this in terms of the market cycle lows of the bear market, or are we just looking at the summation of all of the data as a whole? because if we are including the 2020 capitulation, which, in my opinion, i don't think we should, uh, we should consider this
uh, you can see, you know, this was down here at minus 016, and we're currently floating below that level at minus 025
so it does seem like we are in that final capitulation stage, at least according to previous data that we do have on the mvrv z score
now, one other metric that we can use to look at whether we are, you know, extremely undervalued or, you know, the are, the majority of people are in profit, we can look at the realized price
and once again, this orange line, which is the realized price, is simply, what it does is it takes the average value of bitcoins when they were last moved, it adds up all of those individual prices, and it takes the average of them, and it multiplies that average price by the circulating supply
and what you can see with this metric is when the blue line, which is the price line on a logarithmic growth curve scale, crosses below the realized price, meaning that as a majority, you know, the majority of people who have previously transacted in bitcoin, you know, the average price that they have on that bitcoin is now under the water
and subsequently, you can see we do not spend long below this average price
if we zoom in to this range over here, you can see between the period of september 2011 over to december 2011, you know, representing a couple of months or so, we were out of this range coming over to the 2015 bear we capitulated below this in december 2014, and we were out of this in october 2015
if we do zoom over to other cycles, though, it is less bearish
looking at the 2020 pandemic scare, this really, we were out of here in the same month
but nonetheless, you can see for the realized price, we are currently, or the actual price, is capitulating below the realized price
and historically, whenever this happens, it normally means we are closer to the bottom than the top
as you can see, at this moment in time, the realized price is sitting at 22 638, whereas the actual btc price is sitting round about the range
once again, these are just two other metrics to help us identify when the market cycle lows are if you do want these charts, be sure to head over to look into bitcoin
and remember, this realized price chart is simply the blue line and the orange line from the mvrv zscore
we just talked about the zscore over on this chart, and then moved over to the realized price uh, to pretend that the mvrv zscore was not on this chart
[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
yeah? so we can cautiously think about the situation that the low might actually really be in
okay, so this does not necessarily look like a corrective move up anymore
but as i said in, i think in the chain link video, this could be a leading diagonal that is developing here, which means you can have overlapping waves
and, i mean, it did everything it needed to do bitcoin, didn't it? it came down
we came to one of my targets to complete this correction, which was here at 17 500
in the live stream today, i told you, as long as we're not breaking out of this pattern to the upside, my view would be certainly that we go down lower
now, you know, i'm sort of, i'm not leaning yet towards the the lowest in because we don't have yet confirming price action
and therefore, in the previous video i said, you know, we're pretty much in a 50 50 state
for the last seven months, i've been telling you we have to, we have to go in the region between below 286 k
the reason for that was that this low was a wave a low in a wave c low
it is just the highest likelihood that you go below this wave a low
a lot of people were like, here, you know, this is a running flat
and you know, if you know about elliott wave patterns um, you'd probably know what a running flat is
it would have meant that here, it could have ended this, this whole correction
and it was painful telling you that for the last seven months
and when we reach that target area, we reevaluated the situation
however, what developed here was a price action that i told you is not going to allow us to break to new autumn highs
and then when we um came down here, i told you, this is most likely another triangle
and i can't tell you yet that the low is in, and it's an abcde triangle
and we can, highest likely would expect another move down in five waves, which happened
there's a chance, good chance, that this was only the first wave of another five wave move down, which could probably take us to 10k
because we have fulfilled long term, medium term, short term, elite wave counts, five waves
now, what was still missing was confirmation in the shape of a five wave move up
now, what would support this argument? and what would be the point where i would cautiously start to tell you that i think the bottom is in? they would be here, 21 000 334
even better would be a move above three thousand two hundred ninety five
so here it's still a bit unclear then if we go above that level
but here we can really, really, yeah, with more confidence say, okay, twenty three thousand, two nine five
you know, with what we see, we can assume the low was in, okay? and, um, everybody who used my buy orders was able to buy here below 18 000 on discord
so it's not that this was the only buying point, but, um, yeah, that's that those buy orders on discord just help to deal with fomo
because if we suddenly just start to see this, and this is what is happening in the crypto space, when you start to see these impulsive moves up, it can be big
and a few days ago, i posted on twitter, and by the way, if you're not following us on twitter, just make sure you do it if you're interested in this channel and content, because there is additional content on twitter
now, what i can't tell you yet if it is a rally that will be corrective, in a sense that it will not take us to new autumn highs or will it be an impulsive rally, but because we are so oversold on various time frames, irrespective, not considering the overall economic situation, because my view is the overall economic situation is priced in into the chart
you know, you can't, you can't just give the economic situation, um, give that as a reason that we will drop further, because markets start to recover way before you actually see it in the real economy, way before when you see it on the news headlines, on the bbc or cnbc, or wherever, that markets recover, that is already too late
and you know, we we've seen it times before in in times of war, that markets even made new alltime highs in a war, yeah, and recovered, like when a war started, for example, markets recovered just a month or two months later
um, so, however, you know, it's not confirmed yet, don't get me wrong, but we can become carefully optimistic
in this scenario, should we really start to move up from here, we would have even held the 786 percent fibonacci retracement level
but i would like to see confirming price action above 21 334, and even better, 23 295
that's, by the way, what i posted yesterday already in the telegram chat group
what was missing yesterday was the first impulse, which is starting to evolve here
after a scenario is finished, like this one, we need to wait for the next step, which is happening now
so if we close the weekly candle, and i mean, the way this is going up now, today it moved up already from
where are we now? no, it moved up from around 18 000 now to 21 000 nearly
um, [Music], it would be a good, a really awesome sign for bitcoin should we close above the 200 week moving average
so let's just see where the 200 week moving average is at the moment
it's a very, very critical, uh, level of support, which in the bitcoin history has always supported bitcoin price massively
so you can see that one of the only times the price really broke below it was here
and, yeah, the weekly candle seems to have closed actually below it
because it would mean that we closed the weekly candle actually above the previous bull market high
so that is obviously, uh, something that happened on the weekend that we crossed, that we broke the previous bull market high
um, which acted as support around the 20k area, just below that
so then, and don't close the weekly candle below it also another good sign
if it is, that's what what it might become, you know, at the beginning of a new uptrend um, then it is still too early to confirm it, but it's worth looking, and it's starting to look good

[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
so bitcoin, obviously, as mentioned in the previous video, did hit here, my target level at 17 500, just a little bit higher
but, um, from here, theoretically, bitcoin has now a chance to move up
as you know, if you've been following my my videos my channel, you will know that i actually expect a reversal fairly soon
i can't give you the exact time and how long that takes, because we have two options now
bitcoin fulfilled my longterm count, my medium term count, and also here the the short term elliot wave count, means that it has, honestly, it has now a really good chance to move to the upside
but without having confirmation, without really turning around and seeing a trend reversal emerging, i can't confirm it's now done
and as long as we don't see a trend reversal, which would mean significant price action, in my opinion, at least above 21 334, i can't call the low in
yeah, this is very important, because even though, um, the elliott wave count has been completed, and we can even here in the short term count five waves down, this could still evolve into something more extended
i don't know if this is going is, if this is, of course, it's a five wave move, but is this only the first wave of more downward pressure? yeah
you know, we're now driving on site, all my scenarios have been fulfilled
so i've been talking about these levels, you know, below 286 k all the way down to 20, since november december
now we dropped a little bit below 20, but that is not a problem
it's all still covered in that current elliot wave scenario mentioned before, and also in the last few days
especially that the next key fibonacci retracement level is around 16 900
this will be significant support, or it should at least be significant support, for bitcoin
now, um, it could be that this was already the absolute low of this correction, and we are now going up
we need to see a five wave, elliot wave wave count, impulsive move to the upside to confirm that we will go up
and even better, a three wave correction down, making a higher low
um, no financial advice, but typically that is what what the best you can get
as long as we are still below 21 334, i am still, my primary expectation is further down, because we don't have a reversal signal yet
irrespective of if we see here, whatever, w pattern or something, this doesn't really mean a lot, um, because, you know, we've seen w patterns everywhere here
so all of this patterns, you know, we need to wait for confirmation
now, one way to play this, yeah, one way to play this, if you want to follow the chart closely, one way to play this is, of course, you know, when you have a swing low like here, yeah, maybe the next swing low, when you see now, a bullish divergence, or, no, a bullish engulfing candle, for example
so the key level here would be, i think, 20 080, that swing low of the wave
but then what i would do, i would certainly set the stop loss, and then in every swing low that goes higher, i would move the stop loss up
that is the best way of taking this, in my opinion, of doing this in such an early turnaround point
i think the lowest one around 1700 500 or 17 800, triggered here um yesterday
so i'm, you know, i have no reason to film when it goes up from here, because i've, i've sort of secured my position in bitcoin um already, and therefore i don't need to have any fomo
so there's two ways of playing this, either setting a stop loss, or not setting a stop loss, putting your bitcoin onto a hardware wallet
but then you need to understand that price could still drop to seventeen thousand, maybe even ten thousand dollars
and in my opinion, we are due a rally, posted on twitter a couple of days ago, and in my opinion, that will be the biggest rally since the alltime high
what i don't know is if it will be an impulsive rally, which can even go to a new cycle top, or if it will just be a a larger, corrective rally up maybe the 40 maybe the 50k before we come down once more quite strongly
and therefore, in the current environment, i think stop loss important if you're doing trading
and at the moment, this looks very, very much three wave like at the moment
but it's really too early to say, because this could become either after this five wave moved down, this might have been the the first wave, only this might be the second wave, which means there will be a third wave down
and in my opinion, this will be confirmed below seventeen thousand five hundred
so it would look like something like that, a wave one, a wave two, a wave three, oh, a four away
that would be the wave count that could seriously bring us close to the 10k level
yeah, um, but only if we go below that wave five low here that you can see here
and then there's still a chance to find support here at the nine hundred dollar level
but when that gets broken, yes, i think this is going to play out
now, the other way around would be that we can count this here
this might be another one two, and then we should now see bullish and move higher from here
should break, in the next instance, the 20 000 um, what was it 80 level or something, the resistance
and then also significant and strong price action above 21 331 um
if we don't see another move up, this is just a three wave move that would be followed, very likely, by a five wave move down
or if you feel fomo, why don't you buy a position at the next swing low? that's up to you
well, why not do that and set the stop loss? you know, this is how to play this
because at the moment, we don't have we are in a difficult situation
we are in a situation where we have completed, for the first time, really, since i've been covering bitcoin and elliott waves, and since i've started talking about this downtrend in december, it's the first time that we have completed the longterm count, the medium term count, and here the short term count, which doesn't mean that it guaran with guarantee, is finished, but it means on every time frame, we can count five waves
so there's a good chance for the market now to reverse back into an uptrend
but because i don't have a crystal ball, i cannot confirm that yet
therefore, we need to observe the price structure very closely at the moment
and what i can tell you at the moment, this is still looking like a three wave structure
no confirmation that this is an uptrend already, um, and also no confirmation that, yeah, you know, we are in a five wave move up already
um, we are in a possible turnaround space, but it's just not confirmed
and therefore, at the moment, the options are pretty much, in my opinion, quite equally, you know, bullish and bearish at the moment, because we have reached now, finally, that's turnaround space, where we have a potential opportunity to really end this correction
but if the market is unable to do it, then we will first go to sixteen thousand nine hundred, the seventy eight point six percent fib level
and then if we go below it, then, i mean, then this is really bearish, actually, um, because this would indicate that this is only a wave one, in my opinion, unless i find another count a one, this would be a two, then a three down, a four up and a five down
now, and we have a wave 4 up, and that might end somewhere here around 13, 14k, because you want the wave 3 to do the 1618 extension, which would be around 15k
so all of this would still be covered by the current elliott wave scenario of bitcoin being in a larger wave too, because this can stretch out much, much lower
and there we just get, and we have to be very honest, that we just get to the limits of what technical analysis can do
yeah, it could forecast those price levels six to seven months ago, but it cannot tell you now when we are going to turn around
because we've reached everything we wanted to reach, everything we needed to reach, and now it's up for the market to turn around or not to turn around
and anybody who wants to secure a position either do it dollar cost average and be aware, without a stop loss, that it there is still significant downside potential

and i said in the last video that, um, a lot of elliott wave analysts believe that we are currently in a larger wave four
so from the arithmetic chart point of view that i have here, i cannot come to the conclusion, because, especially now that bitcoin crashed below 20k um, it came into the price region of the wave one back here
so you you could count this as a wave one, you know, and the wave two, and then here of three and the wave four, potentially yes
but, um, it now came down too far, so it doesn't count anymore
but from a log chart point of view, a lot of elliott wave analysts use the log chart
but still, the log chart is a valid method of analyzing, and it is just a different way of doing it
but if you use the log chart, you can come to different conclusions then if you use the arithmetic chart
now, i purposefully don't use the log chart, but in the last video, i mentioned it that there is the scenario on the log chart
and want to show you here a couple of, um, scenarios on the log chart
but where are we in terms of the log chart at the moment? so this is the entire bitcoin history chart
and [Music], what it shows you that from the beginning here, the first cycle top, basically was a wave one
and here in white, you can see we are still in the wave three
but then within that wave three, you started a wave one, a wave two
that was a wave three, often times the longest wave, the strongest
then we came down the wave four, and we are now in this wave five, in yellow
so within that yellow wave 5, which could be complete or not, and we look at that in a minute
then we moved up in a wave 1, we came down in a 2, we moved up in a three, came down in a four
and this is exactly what many elite wave analysts believe at the moment, that we are here in this wave four
you can see that on the log chart, you're not cutting into the price region of this green wave one
i know, because it doesn't show me the, okay, let's just measure it properly
and i guess that might differ from exchange to exchange slightly, doesn't it? because, you know, you've got different exchanges with different values
so around about 13 820 would be the invalidation point here for the wave 4
so that means, you know, in this scenario, can still drop a bit more
but the way this is coming down, for me, it's just too strong for a wave 4, even on the log chart
however, looking at the fibonacci retracement levels with a log scale gives you an idea, uh, how far we are actually coming down in percent
and, yeah, you know, normally what i tell you is that the wave 4 is coming down into the region between the 50 and the 382 um fib levels, in this case, between sixteen thousand four hundred twenty and twenty three thousand fifty six
so that is why many eliot wave analysts, you sort of use the log chart, first of all, because it's easier, long term, to um, to chart it out, and also to because it currently adheres to that scenario
if you use a log chart, you probably come to this conclusion, that we are in wave four, which then would mean that in the wave 5, which comes next, we are going to make a new alltime high
and then we can also possibly project here out what the target for that next wave 5 might be, just assuming, and let's just assume we've might, we might hit the low here
but the wave five here in green, you would say the one to one ratio
so assuming wave five will be as long as wave one, which is a possible possibility
and that would assume that we make a slightly higher high compared to wave 3
now, if we come any lower in this wave 4, all those targets will move as well
so if we go any lower, you cannot use that target anymore, ideally, because you will make a lower low in the wave 5 compared to the wave 3
then you go to the next sensible target, and that is the 1618 fibonacci extension level
but, um, even even if we stopped here now, yeah, and we've made the low, and we say, okay, bitcoin will go as per this one to one ratio target, to the one to the 76k level, we still need to keep an eye on the next target, which is the 1618, which is, you know, if bitcoin moves to 70, if the target is 76, the one to one, the 16185 extension, would show us a target for that wave 5 of 187 k
so this is still far away and difficult to forecast, but these are sort of the the targets you would get here on the log chart
and that is what will lead to invalidation, in my opinion, of this waveforce scenario
so the alternative would be that you've already seen the um wave 5 here
so it would mean that we've had a wave 3 here, we've had a wave 4 there
and that would mean also that we are in a wave four, but we are in the, in the white wave four, basically
so what would that mean? it means you are here now in this wave four, which means lower levels
okay, yeah, which means invalidation point here is, you don't really want to know, 34
no, sorry, we don't, because we want to calculate the length of the wave three in white
that would mean we are in a white wave four, in the next higher level wave four
so what would that mean? that would mean, in a way, four, you would need to go down to a minimum, actually, of 236 fibonacci retracement
and that would be at around about 6 000, as you can see it there
now, and fair enough, you know, not telling you it's impossible
um, but even after this one, it would indicate we will make another wave five to the upside, which would be also another bull run
it just means we come down a bit lower in this current bear market
but, um, yeah, it's, it's from a log point of view, this would then be the scenario you would use here from a log chart point of view
from my own chart point of view, i wouldn't change the scenario at all
and in a wave 2, you can, without a problem, max it out all the way to the beginning of that wave
so it would all still be covered by the same scenario, but it would just mean we max out what we can do, which, again, is all about likelihoods and probabilities
also, in the way of waves 2 scenario, it wouldn't be because bitcoin, in my opinion, as far as i'm aware, has never dropped below the 887 fip level in its whole history
and, but even on the lock chart, you would actually, um, go up from here
so all of that, you know, it shouldn't really matter too much how low we go
i know everybody wants, always wants to know, when do we start the next bull run? when do we go to moon? but think about it from an investor point of view
if you really believe in bitcoin, and if you've made the decision to to buy bitcoin and maybe other altcoins, you want to be able to buy bitcoin as long as possible, isn't it? because if you don't, or if you can't, then, from an investor point of view, um, you will soon buy much higher prices
okay? so as long as you can buy cheap it, um, yeah, you should be happy
but i know it doesn't always work that way from a psychological point of view
now, as far as i'm aware, bitcoin never moved below the eighty eight point seven percent fib level
that would be the two ten thousand six hundred fifty two dollar level
my view is that after the correction is finished here, we move up in a wave three
the wave three should be a very strong wave, the most bullish wave, normally, and should really lead to a rocket start as well
but i can't promise you that this will happen, um, because there are two alternatives when the correction is finished, either we move up very strongly, or we just go into a long, long, sideways
and until we've hit the low and see the reaction to it, i'm not gonna able to tell you which of these possibilities is going to work out
so far, bitcoin is adhering very well to the elliott waves, um, and also the edit wave count
um, i gave you two targets here, two possible tower, three possible targets on the way down here
yes, we came down to seventeen thousand five hundred eighty five or something
so this was definitely a relevant target to end this wave five, in yellow
so this is now where we need to be on high alert, because this is again, a possible reversal point
and theoretically, the correction could now again be finished
and confidence increases in the view that correction could be finished
but i'm not gonna call the low here until i have positive confirmation, which means that we um see a fivewave structure emerging to the upside
now, currently here on dowel, each other cannot count that on as a fivewave move up
um, so i'm not going to tell you the lowest in, but as long as we make a higher low here and start to move up and maybe make a higher high here, then i'll get more confident and we'll take a look at that
but i posted it yesterday in the telegram and discord chat groups that i would want to see at least, you know, a five wave move up and price action above twenty one thousand three, three, four and twenty three thousand two nine five would be even better
and, um, personally, i also wouldn't be surprised should we go down to the, to the 786 flip level and touch it, which is here that
um, let me go to the daily chart, which is that 16 900 level? here it is
yeah, this is a very, very relevant fibonacci support level, sixteen thousand nine hundred dollars
that is just for a wave to a super, super important support level
um, and as long as we are above that, because obviously holding well, and here, i do expect a strong, you know, a strong reaction
um, and i have to tell you very clearly, we are in a downtrend
as long as we are in a downtrend, so as long i don't tell you we've already seen a trend reversal, like the five wave move up, or something like that, or we've crossed a structurally very important level downside, potential is still very much there
so, and all of that is covered by the current elliot wave scenario over wave 2
so the wave 2 can theoretically go down all the way to the beginning of that wave
yeah, the wave 2 would normally, especially for bitcoin, i would expect it to bounce off the 16900 level, the 786 percent flip level, maybe going a few percentage points below that
um, to go down to the 887, okay? in the current, a very difficult market environment, maybe
but i find it unlikely going below that even i find it's highly unlikely, really highly unlikely
i would never rule anything out, because that's just stupid, because i don't know
but because we have hit all my target levels so far, and bitcoin has done, from a wave 2 point of view, what it needs to do, like it fulfilled the requirements to complete the correction, we now need to be on high alert that at any point in time the reversal could be coming
but i also need to tell you very clearly two things, i don't know when the reversal is coming
from a time point of view, i don't know how long it will take
and also, i cannot tell you, um, if that fivewave move that we see here and can count as complete, if that is going to extend in any way
so it is really only at the moment when we can count five waves to the upside that we can see potentially high confidence this correction is complete
i'm currently not having high confidence in it as being complete, and i won't until we don't make higher highs, higher lows, and we change the trend to the upside, and we see a five wave move to the upside then, uh, until then, my focus will be on more downside
because until i have proof in the chart that the trend is changing, uh, the focus still needs to be on on lower
if we, if we fail to make a higher high here, next target would be the nine 16 dollar level
i'm very excited to see if we are gonna hit it, and how the reaction to that seventy eight point six percent fibonacci retracement level will be

let's analyze the situation for bitcoin, for ethereum, for crypto, see what's going on
are we gonna have a massive recovery? are we going to reject from this bounce that we've had, or are we going to continue to the upside? this is something that we're going to analyze right away on this live stream
guys, how is everyone doing? i'm just going to go quickly through the comment section
are we going to manage to close above this weekly this could give a little bit of strength here for bitcoin in the immediate, short term, next coming days, couple of weeks, before potentially continuing to the downside? or are we going to defend this level? you know, alltime high weekly close? 19 000, 20 000 range
now, my question here for the community, will bitcoin hold twenty thousand dollars? will bitcoin hold twenty thousand dollar range? okay, well, we are trading at nineteen point five, so it's not holding it
but, you know, you know, the deal the range because we could have that volatility
all right? we've actually dipped down to below 18 000, but came straight back up okay, can we get that consolidation? can we defend the level? okay, you can have that volatility
i'm going to give you my opinion on what is happening here on the chart
okay? and, um, i think there's a pretty nice shorting opportunity, in my personal opinion, here for ethereum
i do see a potential rejection here, and then maybe continuation to the upside
so the possibilities in actually getting a rejection here is pretty, pretty high
of course, with a very tight stop loss, it is worth the the chance
tight stoplosses are much needed, because if you start adding and adding to your position or have a large liquidation price, you can get that big volatility, and you will burn your account
crypto legends, how are you doing? well, over 400 people watching at this moment
say, hello, um, will we have, um, another red week? i think a green week will come, says esko, needs to be a green week, says esko
i mean, this is the thing we, um, i did buy some bitcoin yesterday, below 18k
it was good because we were just doing the live stream, and just as i finished the live stream, i did a transfer of my states from stable coins to my exchange, and i did buy some bitcoin, okay, for my longterm portfolio
bitcoin is having a little bit of a relief rally, a little bit of pumpy action
and this hasn't have been navin, how are you doing? thanks for joining
why not? shall we take a look at a coin? uh, what's going on with apecoin? let's take a look at apecoin right away
why not a bitcoin? what's going on with apecoin? uh, let's go to the daily here
um, apecoin is having a pretty nice consolidation at this level, just above three dollars and below 450
let's take a look at the full hourly car uh, chart here for apecoin
[Music], very hard to say on apecoin, a large, large consolidation, bigger relief rally could can be possible on apecoin
let's take a look at apecoin right away here on the chart, see what we can see
i mean, a potential careers is possible here on a coin in the immediate, short term
uh, if bitcoin does behave, if bitcoin does defend this 1920k levels, if we close this weekly candle, okay, above the eighteen thousand
we could see a little bit of a, more of a relief rally in the coming days, before potentially continuing back down
we've had such an aggressive drop here on bitcoin the last, you know, few days, massive red weekly candle
is it time for a consolidation, or are we just going to slice through and continue back down? something that we need to know here on bitcoin is that, of course, the possibilities and breaking this this level, you know, are very, very high, which is currently at this level
if we do break it, remember what we have been talking about on the latest streams
once we create a big weekly candle breaking below this major support level, okay, it's going to be absolutely crazy
the biggest volume that we do have here, traded from the last four years, starts at eight, twelve thousand dollars
why is it the strongest level? because it's been the level where we've had most of consolidation
okay, back in 2019 and 2020 as a resistance zone, price action in between twelve thousand dollars and twenty thousand dollars has been relatively fast
okay, in between 12k and 20k, the only level that we could get a potential stop is exactly 14k
why 14k? once we create a solid breakdown here on this 19 000 range, if we do start closing a weekly candle, you know, hitting 18k, 17k, we can expect the price to come all the way down to 14k
and why is 14k can be a solid level? well, just because it's a monthly close
all right? it's a very important monthly close from the old time high created back in 2017
let me just show you here the monthly chart and how this level has been respected
it's the monthly close here, as you can see, from december and the open of january
okay? this monthly close was perfectly respected here, back in june of 2019
you can see we exactly touched at that monthly level with the wick here
okay, just a quick, massive relief rally hitting that level and very much respected here
you've also got a wic touched to perfection, and you have that monthly close from october of 2020
as you can see here on the chart, we start closing weekly candles well below nineteen thousand dollars in the next coming weeks
okay? it's very likely that the continuation is going to happen
you lose this alltime high level, you lose this monthly level also
you have a monthly close exactly round about that, um, seven hundred, 19700 range
this is why bitcoin is just sitting at that range with a little bit of volatility
i think that the possibility in holding the next couple of weeks is, is very possible
but if we do lose this level, i will be very much interested to continue shorting the market with those bouncers, with those retracements
the reason why is because you lost the most important support level, alltime high of 2017 at this moment
and looking at the, you know, monthly chart, weekly charts, you can see here that, you know, the volume basically, you know, disappears
the price action to the upside, like i said, from 12, 14k all the way up to 20k, is very, very low
you can come as fast to the downside when price action moves fast from a range
what i what i want to explain, price action from 20k all the way up to 29k, to 30k levels, was very, very fast
now, this level that we did respect as support in january was respected in the summer of 2021
what happened? okay, we can see weekly closes above this range
we were holding that 30k range, but not for long, until we broke down
look at the price action from 30k down to 20k levels, even below 20k
you know, one of the main reasons that this was so fast in just a couple of weeks is because we did go up there very, very fast
also here in december, november, okay, of 2020, price action was very fast
you break a solid support level, price action comes down as fast, or even faster
when there is selling pressure and there's panic, you move faster to the downside, then you actually go to the upside
so this is why, if we do lose 19, 020k levels and start closing daily candles, even a weekly candle, you know, round about 18 175 k levels
that is enough weekly daily candles to confirm that you are actually going to continue back down
because price action from 12, 14k levels has, as has moved very, very fast to the upside
and when you have fast move moves to the upside, and you break the most important support level, you have that fast move back down
so this is why, you know, is, you know, the panic and the capitulation, the fear can very much continue if we lose the alltime high a lot of people are eyeing this level, alltime highs
if we lose alltime highs, um yeah, 12k is gonna be very, very real
so we as traders need to take advantage, you know, of this big, massive panic selling moment that can happen in the next coming weeks, guys
so make sure to subscribe to the channel, smash up that like button, because we'll be finding very good opportunities, no doubt about that
if we do lose this last kind of support level, we had a pretty nice consolidation here in november, december
sorry, yeah, around, well, november and december, you know, several weeks consolidating here below the alltime high
price is reacting to that level, you know, dipping below, pumping, holding the range
is it going to hold for a few days or a few weeks? it doesn't really matter
we want to take advantage, you know, if we do lose this level, the probabilities in coming down actually to 14k, 12k is just very, very high, guys
it's the only support level that is left until we actually hit 1412k
anyway, that's just one, an explanation that i wanted to give you here, what i think on the chart, you know, best example was this one right here, the runup that we did have in november, december of 2020
it was still, it was also about four, five weeks from, you know, these 12k levels all the way up to 20k levels
and we know that the capitulation, the selling pressure, the fear, is much worse than the euphoria
you know, markets move much faster to the downside than to the upside
um, what's up guys? monk, how are you doing? btc, will fall fall further? hey, says brown boss, yeah, probably, yes
like, like i was just saying, you know, the probabilities and and losing this range, the fear is still there in the market, uh, worldwide
if we do lose this nineteen thousand dollar range closing, strong, daily candles, weekly candles, you know, just hitting that eighteen, seventeen thousand dollars, expect, okay, any relief rally to have more continuation to the downside, no doubt in my mind
seems like people are off work, they have some time to enjoy a little bit of, you know, technical analysis
so just i ask one thing, absolutely destroy that, like button guys for me
this was one of those cryptos that did, uh, something absolutely amazing
what was that amazing thing? well, just, you know, just with a bunch of lines on the charts, and it was that, really, that kind of easy
you know, it was pretty insane how we were just hitting this major consolidation level, a big support range where i had this orange box
second rejection was a confirmation that this was going to continue
this was just about, you know, two weeks ago, approximately, when we were trading at this range
and, you know, very likely that this kind of bear flag, it was a little bit over extended, but this ascending channel was very likely going to break down and retest this exact level, which was the 5 cent range, the lows of the sum of 20 21
and it's pretty insane how these levels are very much respected sometimes, you know, there is money to be made, you know, with these
seeing the probabilities also, you were hitting, you know, round about that 50 fibonacci retracement, okay, from this major drop, exactly, getting, you know, from the highs here, grade in november to the lows in january, 50 fib level, getting that resistance, double top scenario, uh, resistance trend line, ascending channel
we were looking, you know, that drop from about the the eight cent level down to that five cent range
um, what now? well, i mean, this is the thing bitcoin behaves
let's take a look at the short term here on trx, see what could be the probabilities
i mean, probabilities on trx actually getting rejected from this range is is very, very high
reason number one is because we are basically hitting the strongest level on the vpvr, from the volume trade of the last six, seven months
this trading range, biggest volume right is right over here, right now
so i think on trx, it is very likely that we are going to continue back down
this very much looks like it is going to come down to retest that 5 cent level
you need to stay cautious with these alt coins, because volatility is insane
probabilities and actually coming down to try and retest the lows in the coming days is very, very high
could you get an abc correction? this is the thing you need to be staying cautious
from this major drop, i would take fib level, bib level, looking at the four hourly, i mean, it's you could actually take it from here, or from here
this could be a level we're actually getting rejection from this, six, one, eight, fifty percent
i mean, this is a little bit difficult right now, because with the fibonacci retracement, because we are getting, you know, could you take it from here, from here, or from here, from this potential big drop? you can use both actually
you know, you're hitting the 382 from the drops starting from this range on the second of june, first of june, and it's hitting the 382, getting that resistance from this level
i wouldn't say you stay extremely cautious with this, because you might get a drop hit the 618 from this pump
very, very likely, not even retesting the lows, and you could get a bounce
but probabilities on trx coming down from this level is just very, very high
i would say, very likely in the coming days, we'll be retesting 618, which is around about a 53 level, currently trading just below six cents
major drop to this level is highly probable next coming hours, couple of days on trx
i would be, um, cautious with a potential abc kind of correction, trying to claim these highs and then a bigger drop
um, yeah, that's what i would be looking for here, this kind of momentum wave after this huge drop, and then continuation
from the last six months, from the last six months, trader trading lost the value area low
i'm just going to take a look at the poll right away, because i asked, will bitcoin defend the nineteen thousand dollar level? fifty eight percent of people are saying no
so, yeah, there's not, uh, all of the, all of the people not extremely bearish
binary x, should be this one, because this one's not dropping
i would stay extremely cautious, because this one has had a pretty severe drop, and this kind of, we are hitting the perfectly right now, the 618 levels from the highs of november
but taking a look at this chart, from the major drop from the november of 2021, this kind of recovery, this kind of consolidation, we are hitting the 618 from this drop
i mean, look at this, these higher highs, you know, higher lows right there
we usually see the smart money, you know, leaving at these peaks, ready for that potential collapse
okay? i mean, this is the thing, but i think this is probably very, very ready for a big, big drop, especially when you're taking a look at, you know, most of the altcoins are dropping
you are not successfully breaking the highs, and you're coming straight back down, breaking the highs not successfully
i think this one is ready to pop and have continuation to the downside in the coming weeks
i mean, it's pretty cool to see how these levels are very much respected
um, so, yeah, i think you know the reason why, i don't know why it's pumping
i have no idea of the fundamentals of this project, but i will take a look at it
this is not any type of buying opportunity, uh, in my opinion
so, yeah, let me scroll down here through the comment section
why do you say pump? you missed the pump from, you know, early this morning, it had a little bit of a relief rally
we having a little bit of rejection right now, stay cautious, because looking at bitcoin also very recent that we do have very, very strong resistance at these levels
okay, in between the 13th of june and the 18th of june, all right, big, big, big consolidation level created a solid, solid support range
we're currently, you know, almost, almost, kind of hit this level
we actually hit the lows right there that we did create on the 15th of june, you know, getting that rejection almost to perfection, hitting that level
also, you know, the aggressive downtrend, if you are shorting, take profits
there's no secret of that, because a massive, big, short squeeze is also very possible
okay, very possible for a short squeeze, a very strong, kind of recovery, relief, rally before continuation to the downside
so we are, you know, let's not try and fight the trend and find the bottom
if we are getting hitting major resistance levels, you know, short the market, take quick profits
but you can see here on bitcoin, just keeping it simple, okay, with some major levels
this low, this low over here, created on the 15th of june, 17th of june, june
where could we get fib label fib levels? okay, you know, you could either say that the drop started from here, right? you've got a green pump here on the four audi and then you get a collapse
or you can either say it collapsed from this level, right? big relief pump, and then it collapsed
so let's just take a look at fibonacci retracement from these two levels on the four hourly, this top to this low
we are exactly getting a rejection from that six one eight also
so we got the lows, and we got the six one eight hitting that level
four hourly closers below the range starting to get that rejection
so you could already, you know, short that range, take profits, protect position
and also, let's take a look at fibonacci retracement, see what levels it is from this high over here
fibonacci retracement from this height to the low, almost hitting the 50
and if this leg up does get rejected, and we close a four hourly below this high, or even a one hourly, if we take a look at the one hourly, remember, this is a strong level, big spike on the vpvr, it will be 50 fibonacci from this low
and it will be also, you know, just be a little bit of volatility created, all right? and you will be very likely, still inside of the 61865 range
okay? just get that spike and potentially still consolidate and get a failed attempt
if you get that bullish momentum in the next coming hours and days, it's this is shorting opportunity
the thing about this is that you could get a huge relief pump on litecoin against bitcoin
you can see litecoin in the short term, maybe outperforming bitcoin, maybe to the downside or to the upside, it doesn't really matter
but this is kind of ready, but it is still in a very aggressive downtrend
but, yeah, this is, uh, i wouldn't get too excited about this
is litecoin doing? well, look at this huge, aggressive downtrend
i mean, look at the pump that had litecoin against bitcoin back in april and may of 2021
you know, since then, aggressive lower highs, is just continuing um, yeah, i wouldn't get too excited
uh, this is a conversation that you are having from someone in the comment section
uh, well, uh, we try to make very successful trades on the channel
um, we've been doing some very, very good calls on the channel
uh, mark dutch, how are you doing, my man? bitcoin pumps 10k bucks
ready? montenegro? um, mark dutch, thanks for joining the live stream
uh, so, yeah, hey, bro, you're the best on analyzing on bitcoin
um, and you don't you see a bear flag forming on btc usdt, let's take a look
let's see the time frame, because it's important to say the time frame a bear flag forming on a bitcoin
it should be, what? in the lower time frames? is it in lower time frames or higher time frames? this is extremely important
it's still in a pretty aggressive, um, down, you know, big, aggressive drop
why not? let's take a look at ada right away and see what's going on
let's go here on the binance chart, where we do have more data
why is it currently a good, strong support range? because zooming in, checking out the trading range that we have had on ada, we're currently at these low levels, 44, 43 level
if we do get a solid four hourly candle close below this 43 level, a big, solid drop
okay? i would be looking for potential levels where we can bounce on ada
a good level is the 36 cents, okay? this is where i would be looking for potential long opportunities if we do get that drop, for that relief rally
why 36 cents? well, if we go to the daily zoom out, this has been a very, very large consolidation area
okay? as you can see here, a lot of daily closes in between the 35 and 37 level
okay? this is a consultation that we had back in january of 2021
so expect a potential claim from this level and create a kind of a double bottom, just slightly creating, you know, a lower low here and getting a stronger relief rally back up to around about that 44 cent level where we are currently trading
um, so yeah, level to level, these are, this is the next range where we could see those opportunities now with, this is the fourth retest from this range
are we, you know, are we going to get a bounce from this level this time? you know, probably not
probably you might think to yourself, okay, i do long support levels, but i don't long support levels on a fourth retest
if we break down, the price will have to stop some at some point
and your best chance here on ada getting a stop here at around about that 36 37 level, is just very high, because you have a very large consolidation, big spike on the vpvr
these levels are very much respected in the immediate, short term
so there are some potential gains to be made on that on that good bounce
you have some kind of relief rally and some kind of consolidation
the 43 level, it's very likely going to have that continuation back down
so these are the levels you want to look for, not once you've been trading here for a long time with a huge amount of volatility, then you know it can break up or down
you want to try and take advantage of that momentum once it happens, once you are trading here for a long, long time, then, yeah, it's not in you basically not interested
once you create that bearish momentum, find levels where you could potentially bounce, and find levels where you could potentially get rejected to have that continuation to the downside, if that makes any sense
you could get a bounce, retest these high zones, or you could actually break down
so we can go to the brave new coin chart and take a look at bitcoin
um, these are very interesting levels to start buying up, guys
can this bear market be, you know, multimonthly? can this be bear market be in between, six months, 24 months, 28 months, approximately? you know, it can, you know, take several, several months, but if you take a look at the overall trend, of course, yeah
you know, when the price has that bearish momentum for a few months, it, you know, we do not know where the exact low is
so when we're going down this aggressively, i am accumulating bitcoin
not sure how long this is going to take, but i would say several months till we have the next hype, bullish momentum
it is a very unlikely to see a vshaped recovery when you create this aggressive bear market downtrend, okay? it does take some time to recover
you might just go consolidate sideways for the next coming months
you know, it might be in between twelve thousand and twenty thousand
you know, six thousand, seven thousand dollar range for bitcoin is nothing
you know, bitcoin moves seven thousand dollars, ten thousand dollars, in less than one week, easily
so we can see it here, the open from this month, oh, this is the monthly chart, but, yeah, we basically know that we've had a pretty aggressive drop on bitcoin last week
you know, in just one week, we went from twenty seven thousand dollars all the way down, you know, even retesting below eighteen thousand dollars
so having that consolidation in this massive bear market that we have, in in between 12k and 20k, i mean, yeah, who cares? who cares? accumulating bitcoin at 14k or 17k, you know, because, of course, you want to get into the lowest price possible
but are we going to reach there? you know, are we going to reach those levels? you just imagine bitcoin, very likely to happen, is going to have a vshaped recovery right now, in the next couple of weeks, in the next few weeks, a few months
so, you know, what do you think is going to happen? you you're going to have an a euphoria phase, okay, of people jumping into bitcoin back again, not expecting this recovery
i would be much happier if we do go down, then we actually have a recovery
i have, you know, mentally, you know, mentally prepared for the next, you know, several, several months, six, 24 months, maybe slightly more than that, to, you know, buy up, buy up
at this moment, you know, there's going to be time, very likely going to be time to accumulate
oh, we've had a pretty nice, um, relief pump right now on caster
but it does look like that cast is finding a kind of a bottom here
it is going sideways a little bit, slightly lower lows, having some relief pumps right there
what is very likely that caster will be launching the application, of course, soon
um, once the application is launched, of course, there will be massive, big speculation
once the application is launched, there will be heavy marketing behind, okay, the application, uh, for businesses to use it
and there might be a huge speculation on custer for big, massive momentum
once the application is launched, then, yeah, i mean, it's very likely to have some kind of hype and bullish momentum
i mean, we've got so many people that are bearish and bullish
um, this is also a possibility that, you know, who knows why not, the bottom can be in
has the dxy got enough bullish momentum to continue up? we were talking about the dxy on my latest live streams, looking potentially for that kind of double top, or higher high, or slightly lower height, but definitely coming up to retest this support trend line that was broken, to indicate that the parabolic momentum on the dxy that we have had for the last few months, because the dxy, the dollar index, has had a parabolic move, okay, for several months
uh, you can see it here with this trend line, with these higher lows
so what's happened? we have broken the trend line of these aggressive higher lows
you know, the possibilities on the dxy actually falling from this level, i think, is very, very high
we got a perfect consolidation from the trend line of the higher lows
i mean, if i could find the video, we were talking about that possible scenario
okay, very likely to happen on the xy, coming to retest the trend line and coming back down
um, so yeah, if the dxy, in the next coming weeks, starts to have an aggressive downtrend from this point, then expect bitcoin to pump
why do i think this is a possible scenario? because we do have that weekly close
we're talking about this weekly close that is going to be very, very important
we go to the weekly charts, that weekly close is at 189 k levels
weekly close is going to be happen, be happening in the next few hours
i like the 24k level because we do have a pretty nice daily level at 24k
also, if you haven't joined my world series of trading competition for buy bit, okay
if you haven't signed up for gia for bible and you are an experienced trader, make sure to sign up, because you get a bonus of up to four thousand and fifty dollars, and also zero percent make a fee for 30 days
you do not pay make a fee for 30 days, once you sign up with a link and join my buybit team
we are going to be extremely active on the special telegram people for only the, you know, the people that do join my team
the link for the telegram and the link for joining my team is down below
from the 25th, two days before this the the competition starts for 20 days
we are going to be extremely active, only looking for the high probability trades on bitcoin, ethereum and some altcoins, of course
what about their slant resistance where we have been dumping after hitting in the four hourly chart? it's still valid, right? uh, the four hourly chart? uh, major resistance
and what about that slant resistance where we have been dumping after hitting the four hourly chart? um, i'm not sure if i understand that
so, i mean, i'm just saying here, if we do close this weekly chart, okay, this weekly candle, then we are probably going to have some consolidation and some bullish momentum for the next coming weeks
but if we, you know, looking at the short term time frame, we are hitting big resistance zone
this was mentioned at the beginning of the live stream, right over here
where we do, you know, we can go to the four hourly, one hourly, even better short term analysis, we are getting rejected
what is happening right now is that we're hitting big resistance
you know, if you are thinking too long at this range, uh, yeah
it's not, uh, the best, high probable scenario, because we did hit perfectly this low created on the 15th of june, getting that resistance, as you can see, getting that rejection, i think there's a highly, slight, highly high probability, and continuing back down
um, what do you think could be the bottom for cardano and ethereum? for ethereum, i did a um an analysis on aetherium, you know, saying that, um, the potential bottom range could be in between seven hundred and and one thousand dollars, just because of, let me just go here
i mean, ethereum has had such an aggressive drop, it's been absolutely insane
you know, we've had a pretty aggressive hype, okay, in 2021, uh, you know, part of 2022, already getting that kind of exhaustion
something similar happened also here in 2017, and then early 2018
and then finally breaking this higher low trend line and having an aggressive drop
once we broke this higher low trend line, as you can see, the price action getting exhausted, exhausted
this is what has been happening for for ethereum, as you can see on the chart
so if i just take a look, you know, you could say that this is a kind of a head and shoulder
it's not the most beautiful, but roundabout, you know, this is kind of the projected move for, for for the drop
and, you know, you could speculate that this would be the kind of movement right there we actually hitting those levels
so, yeah, major lows can be around about this range, in my opinion, between 700 and 1000 dollars
i mean, people are calling for ethereum at two hundred dollars, one hundred dollars
of course, if bitcoin does, we could get that volatility dipping below 700, 600
but this is a major level where i do think we could consolidate for the, for the next several months
not make the exact same scenario, of course, but you know, it is very likely to be round about this this range, the 6, 700, 7, 800 range
i'm not, i won't say we are at, we're bottoming out right now, but i think we are close to it
once we start going sideways and having relief pumps, i think we are going to create a low where it's going to create a big, massive double bottom scenario, or a triple bottom scenario, and have big consolidation there
it's maybe slightly lower low, slightly higher low, and that will indicate very lightly in the next coming months
we are ready for the next cycle in the next coming um, anyway, that's just my personal opinion
i started buying ethereum when it was um, i did manage to buy some here at the cobid uh c19 crash, around about the 100 range, you know, scooping up some at, you know, 110, 120
but most of my average price was around about 200 on on ethereum, average price was around about 200
there is a downward sloping bear flag on near usdt on the four hourly time frame
this has had a huge, huge, huge drop, huge drop on the four hourly chart
there is a downward sloping bear flag on near usdt on the full hourly time frame
okay, so i do see this more as, i mean, this is very likely creating some kind of bullish divergence
yeah, i would say, all depending on what bitcoin does, all depending on what ethereum does
yeah, i think continuation to the downside here on near protocol is very likely for the coming weeks
i would say the summer lows of 2021 is going to be a range that is very likely going to be retested, which is around about the one dollar sixty cents
and on the four hourly, like you said, you know, can it have a short term relief rally? i'm not interested in in trading any of this range on nia protocol
the ideal scenario here for me, for me, for me, for me right now is, i'll tell you right away
um, let's i mean, just for entertainment purposes, let's take a look at the rsi
you know, we do have those massive bullish divergence, massive bullish divergence here on the four hourly
i didn't need the rsi, uh, to take to to know that this is bullish divergence
um, you know, after some, some experience, when you start green these slightly lower lows
yeah, this is a moment where you could get the market getting a big relief rally
what happens if we do get that relief rally? guys? it's gonna be the the shorting opportunity
and you might ask, you ask yourself to yourself, you know, where can i short the market? where is a good level to short? well, you know, just looking at the vpvr, you have a big gap in volume
so that relief rally on neo protocol can happen very, very, very fast
there's hardly any volume traded in between the 350 and the and the five dollar range, basically
and you do have here a pretty strong level, okay, with a little bit of volatility
what range right here? in between 480 and 5 20, approximately
you know, 40 cents of potential volatility at this range if you do get that leg up
and, you know, where does the major drop start? i think the major drop starts from this big spike
you have a big bounce here, and then the drop starts, right? so that is a good level to take a look at fibonacci levels from this height to the low
okay? it's a major, major level where you're very likely going to get rejected
and you don't have to get confused here, because if near protocol does have a pump for in the next one to two weeks, you know, from 310, where we're currently trading, all the way up to 490
and it's very likely just going to be, you know, a huge, massive relief rally, short squeeze kind of situation for continuation to the downside
i mean, this is the thing, in a bear market, lows are retested several times
so if you do create this low, you do get a big relief rally, these big resistance levels are going to get rejected
this level in the bear market will be likely be retested in the next coming weeks
once you get that relief rally, it's just very likely gonna happen
so that is a strong, major level here where i would be looking for a or a short on nia
and like i said, the risk on near right now in having a really, a big relief rally is very, very high
so shorting out these lows, it's just not, it's not the level too short
but the relief rally here with these, you know, bullish divergence, you know
um, you know, the risk here on getting a pretty large relief rally is very high
especially if bitcoin does get a relief rally to 23, 24 000, you might see the bitcoin dominance dropping a little bit
then you're gonna, you are going to see these all getting this, this big relief rally
flm, it was added in, it did have a big, massive pump if i'm yeah, there it is
had, you know, sideways action, and then massive, massive, big spike and big drop over 200, 300 pumpier, from the 10 cent level all the way to 40 cents
i mean, the good thing the re that we did actually retest the lows here from november and january of, you know, holding that range, getting a large consolidation
we had a massive, massive, i don't know what this was, massive, massive spike all the way up to 40 cents
um, this is probably just gonna not do much in the next coming weeks
you still alive? how are you still live? has everyone smash that like button? seb, mark dutch, thank you very much for joining the live stream
what do you think? uh, could be the bottom for cardano and ethereum, i said, uh, ethereum, we talked about around about a 700 range, maybe a little bit of volatility, plus minus a 100
um, successfully you want to buy low and sell high? hey, flat, smack
um, what do you think about eight coin? i think apecoin is just a big, massive speculation, not, you know, big, massive speculation on apecoin
if we do close above 19 000, you know, there could be some sideways action
if we do close the next coming days pretty strongly below, okay, 19 000, we could see massive bearish momentum, okay, for the next couple of weeks, several weeks
all right? because, like i said, we have this huge momentum to the upside, no price volume here, and we could see that happening
okay? we lose the nineteen thousand dollars closing daily and weeklies
uh, you know, june, july, a little bit of kind of sideways action
are we gonna have the summer, july? august, also having a little bit of sideways action? september is usually a bullish month for the stock markets, for crypto also
will we continue down? if we do drop in july and august all the way down here? september can be very bullish, in my opinion
could we see, we could see, you know, september, october, having a little bit of bullish momentum
if a bitcoin does manage to have some bullish momentum in the next coming hours, couple of days, all right, by tomorrow
just imagine we have that breakout from that 20 500 range where we have been bouncing here nicely, as support, where we do have the value area low
if we do have a solid breakout, expect the retracement that we potentially could have to get a big bounce and continue back up
big levels here of rejection is this one right over here, the daily level at 22, 22 700
so stakes from the cautious, extreme level here, to get a bounce, i support the 20 400, 220 500
okay? we do get that breakout, we could get a solid, solid bounce from this level
if price action goes crazy, if we start small consolidation at 227, we could get that rejection
it's a rejection level, daily level, and major resistance and support here, created in june
do you still think that the 12k btc is in? says jj groot, absolutely
it could happen, especially if we lose this 19 000 major weekly level
we could see that 12k bitcoin, if we lose 19 000, closing, big daily candles, even a weekly candle, will absolutely confirm this for me
if next week or the second week, has a weekly candle closing to at 17 000, you know, we only three, four thousand dollars away from these levels
big, big zone, this 19k level, we are getting that reaction, as you can see here on the price action
i didn't feel like trading, but i did see this reaction at this level
the reason why i did enter a short position here, it's sunday
go through my morning run, wake up early, do some meditation, analyze the charts and get into those best opportunity trades
so if we take a look at ethereum right now, what i was taking a look at here in the immediate, short term was this big reaction from this level, right over here, where we do have large consolidation levels, as you can see, support
i mean, this is not perfect, but, you know, you got one spike, second spike
i think we can retest this kind of neckline over here on ethereum
if we do go to the one thousand dollar, nice round psychological number m pattern right there
just a little bit of scalping, day trading, a little bit of speculation
remember, you do have an insane bonus on buy bit and also on primex bt

so if the echo comes back, we know that karma came back to me right away when i was happy
you know, guys, i was at the game yesterday, my friend was playing
yes, that was the only thing, that was the only thing that i knew
how are you? bernie, how are ya? how are ya? uh, okay, so let's see what we can see on the charts
okay, first of all, we're gonna go to forex factory to see what's going to happen during this week
yesterday, last week, we had a lot of news that came out, and we were prepared for that, because we went through it
we went through it, uh, the the days before, um, so last sunday
because we don't have time to focus on trading and not be good at what we do
we just want to figure out how to be good at the charts, earn the money from it
and even though i'm no financial advisor, but just learn with me how to do it, and then you just take it to your own, like, do it to your own thing, and then start live your life the way you want it to do, right? because you're here for a reason

yes, guys, if you haven't subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that
um, and if we go to wednesday, we have, okay, so the they, okay, so we do have this week on wednesday
and during new york session, usually that that's when the big um, uh, thank you so much for giving on guidance, even sundays
so on wednesday, everyone, uh, great to have this in mind, and especially if you are a beginner, uh, because when we have, especially when they have the, uh, when the fed speaks, the market moves very, very much during the a short period of time, which means that if you've been going into a trade around the level, uh, around the prices close to where, you know, when the, when the news comes out, it's very easy to to lose that positions, because the market is just going back and forth
so you have, like, the four hourly candlestick, you have one small, little body, and you have a wick
so the market has just been going back and forth, back and forth, right? yeah, you know, back and forth, you know
um, so, yeah, uh, go back to so just want you to make sure that you understand that on wednesday, the market can be a little bit volatile during new york session
and natalie, after she but yes, pedro, i think i can remember that
are you sure there's no alcohol in the coffee? no, it's called happiness, i think so, at least
and then on you on friday, we also have a couple of news coming out, uh, 4 pm
so, uh, wednesday, thursday and friday, we have some news coming out
you want me to lie? well, we are bullish right now, if that's something
so, but first of all, we can go to the dollar just to see what's actually happening
and, uh, even if the market is not moving, um, we're using the previous support at previous resistance
i i always, uh, as long as you're yourself, i think everything will be great
looking at the overall picture, we already know, because we've been looking at this one before, looking at the higher time frames, always good to go back in time
i know that on the lower time frames, this was a box that we use, but just drag it back, you can see that this is a previous resistance, support
resistance came back up, broke it, retested, broke down, and we are heading back up to this level right now
and 10695, i know that on the, was it on the three monthly chart, or maybe on the weekly chart only? um, if we went back in time, this is a previous higher low, now, sorry, lower low, support level
and you can see, so we spoke about this level before, and the market pulled back up to it, and we saw the, the, uh, the continuing the retest
and on the lower time frames, we're using the previous support at resistance at 104700
what i also did was that i took a fibonacci from the last highly low um that would have at 101360 mark
so the fibonacci, we almost came back down to this level, uh, friday or thursday
so either so we're gonna, so i'm gonna use this level now to see if we actually start to see some movements to the downside
because may we just might see on bitcoin that we do have a little bullish momentum, but that is only because we've been, we've been pulling back down for so long, or dropping for so long, so we just might have a bigger pullback
so on dxy, i use dxy as the confirmation to see where the direction goes
because bitcoin and every thing that's against the dollars is going to the opposite direction
so let's go to bitcoin now, when you can see we have some momentum
so and tomorrow, as diana said, it is a bank holiday in um in america, so that the market is closed
but looking at the weekly chart, we have one huge, big, big, big candlestick, right? it looks a little bit messy
now, when i have the key levels, i also have the three monthly fibonacci level
natalie, how to be patient? uh, how to be patient is that you have your setup
you don't chase the market, because when you chase the market, you will lose the money
but keep to the strat keep, uh, keep yourself to the strategy
anyone have a blur image? no, i think you can press quality and put it on
have you previously teached how to identify key levels? oh, no, i think i did it one time, but i didn't go, like, i didn't go into it, um, so deeply
and it takes some time, so i'm actually not going to take my time to do that now
so one of the things that we can do, but i want to see how it looks on the higher time frames
because before, if you just go back in time, you saw this huge pullback, right? you saw this drop, and the market was consolidating
and then, you know, slowly steady, you saw the market pull back up
so we just might see something, if the market will be bullish this week, you just might see the market, um, then just consolidating
i mean, even if you're bullish, the market will not just change the direction, right? you will not see a one, big, huge green candlestick breaking everything
um, but we can definitely, we can definitely say some bullish momentum
so one of the things that we can do, uh, is that we drag a fibonacci from the last lower high that we did have, around thirty one thousand three hundred and sixty three
but if we would see some big momentum, we drag it back down to eighteen thousand nine hundred and twenty
can you see how perfectly this, the 50 that we have is exactly combined with the key level, 25 040? this is great
this is great news, guys, because now we understand, if we start to see some bigger momentum to the upside, we can actually see the market pull back up to 25 040
so for everyone, if we start to see a big momentum now, from nowhere, if that would be the case this week, we know that we're looking at 25 040
because we always need to remind ourselves that, overall picture, we are still in a downtrend
so unless the market is not breaking certain like the last lower high, is technically this level at 31 040
so if we would be bullish, someone wanted me to talk about bullish, uh, scenarios
if i would be bullish, we need to break that level, break the resistance trend line
that's when i even you can, you can definitely take some trades inside of what's happening right because now we're looking at the higher perspective
but, but until that happens, i will still look for short is it better? now, gabrielle saw my face
how are ya? okay, but we can also do this, because before we come to 25 040, we can drag the fibonacci from the four hourly chart
that is also combined with the fib with the key level is slightly above the 618 percent at 20 850
and so yeah, this is also a level, of course, that i will look at before we reach 25 040
um, so what we're gonna do is that we will drag a support trendline
um, so i'm gonna drag it from this la, first high low and connect it with the other high low right here
and you could also see that did we come back up? no, we didn't
um, so we are inside fibonacci levels right now, twenty thousand three hundred and twenty thousand eight hundred and forty dollars
and from this level, we could slowly, instead to see the market to reverse back down
now when we, uh, when you ask me the question how to be patient, this is how you are patient
i wouldn't sell the market right now, because the market is not giving me any sign that we're actually is breaking to the downside, right? but i still use my levels, or my technical tools, to see where we could, where we could potentially see the market, um, where i could potentially find a sell opportunity
and what i also gonna do is that i'm gonna use this previous little resistance and also combine it with a small, higher load that we did have
if we would see that the market now on bitcoin, slowly and steady reverses back down
remember, guys, what do i always say when it comes to the higher time frames, fibonacci? i'm gonna ask you this question now, because you've been with me so for so long
what is the difference between a a higher time frames fibonacci that we look at right now and the lower time frames? i want you to add, i want you to answer that question, because this is really important, because this is how i see that
because i really want you to understand what i look at and what what i look for
so when it comes to the higher time frames, fibonacci levels, this is usually, this is also what i lost
phyllis, that is what's exactly what that was the everyone got the right answer, but this was actually the right right answer
uh? on higher time frames, the price bubble, uh, for more than exactly
you're 100 right? so in the around the higher time frames fibonacci, what we see is that the market use the, usually the 15, 60 percent, as a consolidation market
and then you slowly, instead, you see the market break to the downside
but on the higher time frames, when we're looking at the fibonacci, the market usually consolidates before it reverses back down
on the lower time frames, as you can see right here, let's say, for example, that i want to calculate where the next higher low can be, because we can see the market in a pool going to the upside, right? so i drag the fibonacci from low to high
what happens? you you see the market consolidate a little bit
if you go to the to the one 30 minutes or one hourly chart, you see the market just, you know, comes back down with a few two candlesticks, retesting, and then you see this huge push to the upside
but on the higher time frames, you will usually don't see that the market is, uh, usually what happens is that the market pulls back up, you just might break the 618 percent market go slowly back and down
and then from nowhere you see the break, and then you just see the drop
and usually what i do, i actually start to set to sell the market around these tops right here, because i start to see, and i look at the candlestick, and i start to see that, yeah, the market is not whole
and that is why it's really good using the higher time frames
and even if we start to see some momentum to the upside, that doesn't mean, okay, the market will continue up
no, the market just might need to come back up, retest the 618 and then slowly instead, you see the market reverse back down
and you can already see how the market is now, um, retesting these levels inside of it
you can already see, okay, one big wake now we're looking at the 15 minutes chart
we have on the one hourly, pretty big one, and on the and on the four hourly
and this is why it takes, why the market is consolidating more
it's because, oh yeah, i don't even know what i was supposed to say
so, yeah, first of all, looking at bitcoin, we are inside the fibonacci level twenty thousand three hundred and twenty thousand eight hundred and sixty
from these levels, if we start to see the market reverse back, uh, reverse, uh, when we break it, that's when i will start to look at sell positions
if we would see the market, don't care about these fibonacci levels
but if we would see the market have a huge momentum to the upside, i am looking at the fibonacci levels between 25 150 and 26 623
but obviously, as i said before, we look at what happening here
we need to focus on what's happening here, because if we focus on this part, we're gonna miss everything that happens
so when someone asked me, what what do you think will happen in the middle of the week, i have no clue what's gonna happen in the middle of the week
so we are, so we all, i kind of already knew, because i was just looking at the charts a little bit today, and i saw the market had the pullback and the i just knew that, okay, we're, i need to go in and see what fibonacci level, or what level we are, uh, retesting
we're gonna go into ethereum before we go to shiba, because i told you that i would that we were supposed to go to sheba
wagner, hello, how are ya? how are ya? i hope everyone is feeling great today
if you're new to the channel, i usually do this because i want to see who's new and who's not
if you've been on this channel since yesterday, or way back, put 222 in the chat, because i want to connect with you guys
i just love, i just love my subscribers and the people that follows me
so for the new people, who doesn't know who i am, uh, my name is natalie
i got introduced to trading at 2018, and since then, i've been practicing the charts every single day
i'm no financial advisor, but i'm definitely, i'm a very good when it comes to the technicals
and i also have back testing live streams right here, where i also share my knowledge
and i would love to do some back testing together with you today
uh, if we, if we have the time to do with love and the ta and yours as well
and if you want to be part of, uh, if you want to be part of my, the community that i, that i have, uh, with bitcoin sense is my, uh, my personal little community, you also will have the link in the in the chat soon
in this, uh, community, we speak about cryptocurrencies, updates
will you get more in contact with me? because this is where i talk to to you guys, and it's beautiful
we work with the same company between census, the beautiful company
we also have a previous support and resistance zone combined with the key level 1330
so if this would be a level where you see the because you the market can obviously break the the fibonacci levels, and then market pulls back down, and then see the drop
but if we would start to see a bigger, uh, pullback, what we're also gonna do is that we're gonna drag the fibonacci from last key level, 1530, combined with the last lower high that we didn't have at that level
but i still gonna use it against a 912 support, which means that we can pull back up to fibonacci level 1220, potentially 1292
and from these levels, the same thing, we expect the market to potentially reverse back down
and so, i mean, whatever the market does, uh, if we come back, push back up to these levels, we will do that
so we're just gonna follow what the market is doing and take my or i'm gonna take my decision from from there, right? um, but right now, i wouldn't do anything
another confirmation that we also can use is this previous, small, higher low that we have
and if we would say that the market break below it, and that would that means that we will also break the support trendline
and, uh, 1009 is a very important level for us to look at right now, because you can see the market drop below it, come back up and retest, and then see the market bounce back down again
i want to see, i want to see how the, how the beginning of the week looks like
and it is pretty hard to give levels when i don't even know if the market will reverse back down from it
um, but i think you understood what i was looking for when it came to, when it came to time for abba, we're gonna look at chiba because we had a beautiful soul that wanted me to look at she but i think it was sheba in the beginning
[Music], i don't know what this was, but we had this beautiful drop from the, from the fibonacci levels a couple of days ago
i'm gonna highlight this level because from it's, uh, between eight hundred and twelve dollars and seven hundred and thirteen, you saw this huge pushback upright? i mean, as smoking joel says, our beautiful smoking joe says, it's a lot of coins that will go back to zero now
and it doesn't look so beautifully right now on shiba inu, i'm not gonna lie
um, when it comes to the technicals, we came back down to the level that i that i just spoke about
and from [Music], from the from the support, we can definitely see a pullback up again, we can drag fibonacci from 1110 dollars to 772
if that is the case, i would look at 940 and the 980 to see a potential retest, if that could be where we see the market drop again, or if we break the level
i will also use his previous support that we have around 1050
uh? so, yeah, that's what i look at, chiba, you know, if this is the case, ah, take profit one
so now, guys, i'm gonna go into, uh, tell me, i don't know if anyone else said another coin
we've been going through bitcoin, ethereum and now shiba inu, and tell me if there's anything else that you want me to look at
so we know that we will have, we know that we will have news coming out on new york session, wednesday, thursday and friday
okay, so what i'm doing right now is that i highlight the levels where you saw from previous times
from this level um that we're at right now, between 07 940 seven and 07 hundred and forty four, we saw this huge push to the upside, right? but i will also highlight zero point five thousand seven hundred and six and zero point four thousand eight hundred and thirty seven
if we would break the first key at the first level right here, right? so we always know that if we break one level, we have the next level rate, we can potentially see the market break down to, right, um goal
on the daily chart, it looks a little bit better when it comes to market structure
what i'm gonna do is that i will use this previous lower high that would have before this huge push, and i drag it from, uh, one point 270 back down to zero point seven hundred, seven thousand eight hundred and ten
and we've already retested that level one time, so that is daily
i will also drag another fibonacci from zero point to nine thousand and two hundred, back down to zero point seven thousand five hundred
and we are right now retesting the fifty percent of the first fibonacci at zero point eight thousand three hundred and fifty
i will also look at zero point eight thousand eight hundred and fifty, eight thousand five hundred and fifty
if we would break it, we can pull back up first, uh, to the next target at zero point nine thousand and forty, potentially zero point two nine thousand three hundred and thirty
but if we focus on what's actually happening right now, you can see, overall, the market is very choppy
on the floor, i will charge, the market has just been going sideways
and usually you see the market come back down to a support, and then you see the push back up, and then potentially another drop, because overall, the market is still in a dungeon
but just because, i mean, we need the market needs to pull back up too, right? the market needs to pull back up too
another question, what does happen when we have an inverted hammer, kind of
what do we usually see when we see the market giving us an inverted hammer against a support? what does the market do? please give me an answer
uh, maybe not reverse trend, but definitely see the market being a little bit more bullish, right? because overall, you can just see the market drop
and technically, the last lower high on the higher time frames is 27 354
so what i could also do, i could still drag a fibonacci from this lower high to this low at 07 880
we could still see the market pull back up, potentially to 17 seven hundred one points and nine thousand eight hundred and fifty
and we're still in a downtrend, because the market just might need to do a bigger pullback
but as long as we're not breaking the last lower high at seven point two point, seven thousand five hundred and thirty, the market is still in a downtrend
and this is what we have to understand, that market structure is key
if you don't understand market structure, how do you, how do you, how can you even figure things out? to be honest, how can you do that? i mean, it just makes sense, right? lower high, lower low, lower high
because if we, the market gives us a lower high here, that is the one that we will use
we can't use this one then, because the market gave us another lower high to use, right? and if the market would create a higher low, and then market creates another higher high because we break this lower high, then that is a reverse in the trend on the higher time frames, right? okay, now we know
you don't even understand, uh, depends on if you're a trader or an investor
it's so differently when it comes to be an investor and a trader
i'm a trader, so i think from a trader's perspective, so you have to know that
uh, do you believe in longterm trade? of course, of course, of course, of course
and obviously, and obviously, how much leverage do you recommend? i don't, i don't recommend super much leverage, to be honest
but if you don't know how to, if you don't know yourself, i would recommend start with low leverage and just work yourself up so we understand
because, like, high level is good, but you can also lose a lot of money
i'm no financial advisor, but yeah, so, yeah, i wouldn't be surprised if we have a push back to nine thousand dollars or zero points, nine thousand three hundred and thirty two
if this would be a a level where we break, what we're going to do, or i'm going to do, is that i'm going to use a previous resistance support, also previous at higher high if we would see that these fibonacci levels, we just might only retest the 50 and then see the drop reaches from below, and then the continuation back down
but remember that on the higher time frames we're also retesting this previous support, which means that we can have a bigger proof to that upside not
okay, what else you want me to look at? i hope that i did explain pretty well on what i see right now on mana
i just want to say again, like i i just want you guys to know how much i do appreciate every one of you
i don't even understand how i know that i help you so much with this
it's so fun to be able to help people with something that i love
but you have to rem you have to remember that i'm also a female, you know, i can talk about emotions in a different way than guys do
i don't know if there's a lot of guys telling you that how much they love you, but i love you, okay? and i will tell you that
natalie, please explain how to read volume? ali, i don't read volume
i actually don't even use the only thing that i use is fibonacci
and the other tools is like trendline, support and resistance zones
i look at fake outs, but i don't use the indicator volume, to be honest
okay, so we're looking at, uh, so we do look at a link right now
okay, so were you i'm gonna use this previous little this is a demand zone that we are at right now, or below
and that is between, okay, i'm gonna make it a zone on the weekly chart
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna make this a zone from eight point thirty dollars and six point seventy
and we are right now below this level, which is really important for us to use
um, i'm gonna take this one away now, because we don't use it
okay? we're dragging other fibonacci from 928 back down to five point nine, two, two
we almost came back up, and we tested that level, but i would not be surprised if we see a pullback up to seven point sixty dollars and seven, uh, eight dollars
and if we see the rejections at that at around then around them, that could be the next drop that we see
another thing we can do, we drag a support at the resistance trend line that connected the lower eyes with each other
so what i also did was that i dragged the fibonacci from 734 back down to 552
i'd love to have you as my guest on my channel, bobby cryptogranny
who? who are ya? you want me to be a guest on your channel? i would love that
is no, who are you? who are you? you need to tell me who you are
you can already see that the 618 percent is right now getting, uh, retested
we use the support trend line, combine it with the higher lows
and you can see how perfectly this one is connected with the 50
now, if we were to see the market break below, uh, six point forty dollars give us a lower low
you can see it reaches from up below, and then see the continuation of the drop
and then slowly, instead, to see the market continue pull back up to potentially seven point sixty dollars, or eight points as to eight dollars
we drag the support trendline to connect the higher lows, and then expect the market to drop when the market comes to these levels, and then potentially see the market reverse back down
so this is what i look for right now when it comes to, when it comes to chain link
uh, we just need, uh, more good news that's bigger than hitting certain levels
just elliot alone pull the market up by saying he's still buying
i mean, obviously the fundamentals affect the market very, very much, but you, you don't even, you don't actually know
and that's why we still need to analyze, at least me, i analyze the chart
i use the the levels, and you see if the market will respect the levels or not
and, but this is all, this is also, this also comes into um, patient, patient
once again, depends on what you're trying to do, if you're an investor
okay, so we don't have so much, uh, market structure on on this one, because we're going, it looks like we're going back to zero
so first thing that i did was that i did highlight the support that we do have on the weekly chart, or did i take it on the two daily maybe
so i'm gonna, i'm using the wicks at the close of the wicks right here, and connected with this the low
if you connect the dots with the lower highs, the first fibonacci level that i look for is 557, and then 567
and you know what i look for, if this is where we start to see the market reverse back down
um, if we would see more momentum to the upside, i would also look at six point thirty six dollars
also taking advantage of the previous support that we did bray uh, that we're above right now, 543 and 533
if we, i would miss the entry on the on these fibonacci levels that i spoke about at 568, you can also use the previous support as a target to see if we will create it as a new resistance, as you can already see
i mean, the market, i mean, you can obviously just see the market pull back down and then up, obviously
but always good to use a previous support, because we did break the resistance trend line
and as you guys know how much more respected are the, the the trend lines combined to the, uh, horizontal support and resistance zones
so, yeah, okay, you you 90 the trend lines is 90 more respected than horizontal, horizontal support and resistance zones
so if you break one resistance, uh, if you break one trend line, if you break one trend line, usually that is a fake out
and in this case, we could see the market drop below, uh, drop below 532, and potentially give us a retest, and then see the market continue to drop
but first of all, as i told you, if we see a little bit more momentum on ecp, 557 and 568 is what i look for
so can you see how perfectly this was? i did have the support and resistance zones
how are okay? so looking at xrp, what we are in between right now is the resistance at zero point four thousand one hundred and forty the support at zero point seven that did i say? okay, uh, zero point two thousand eight hundred and thirty on the weekly chart
now, on the lower time frames, you see the market pull back down to, um, we are right now retesting the support
what we're gonna do is that we, um, uh, we drag the fibonacci from 04087 back down to zero point three thousand seventy four
that gives us fibonacci levels on the daily now, uh, zero point three thousand five hundred and eighty, or three thousand seven hundred
what we also can do is that we drag a fibonacci from zero point three thousand five hundred and ninety four back down to zero point two thousand and nine hundred and fifty three
you can already see how the market is right now, retesting, uh, the fibonacci level
and but before i even considering going into a trade, what i do is that i use a supported trend line to connect the dots with the higher lows
we can also use this little uh zone at zero point three thousand and two hundred
if we see the market break below it, you could potentially see a uh lower low being created
i will expect the lower high, if this will be valid at that time, i will use another fibonacci from this high to that lower low
because the fibonacci gives me, the market gives me the um the next lower high level
because what do we do from the lower low? we don't do anything
we wait for the market to create the lower low, to pull back up and create the next lower high
if we would see bigger momentum uh as on the other coins, because you can obviously see that happening
we look at the daily fibonacci around 03 580 and zero point three thousand and seven hundred, and the same thing
this is where i expect the market to pull back up to and then potentially reverse back down
but it's the good thing now, when we see the bullish, it's really good, because it is from the lower high we we want to sell the market from
so that for the market to create the lower high, the market, on the downtrend must be bullish
okay, so on a to a, we are creating, uh, the last another support
we don't have anything here to look at, lauren, thank god nobody else is flirting, saying things like, your eyeballs look like glowing red oranges
uh, i drag fibonacci from 06420 back down to the support at hundred 04, sixty four
another thing, obviously, we can use is fibonacci from zero point five thousand three hundred and fifty back down to zero point four thousand three hundred and thirty
we are retesting the fifty percent right now at zero point four thousand eight hundred and thirty
two and this sixty one point eight percent is zero point four thousand nine hundred and sixty
and another thing that we can do is that we use the previous resistance also
and if we would see the market break below zero point four thousand seven hundred and seven, give us another lower high, potential, uh, lower low
we can see the market, uh, potentially retest the previous resistances, create it as a new resistance around 04 738
okay, so this doesn't have to happen now, because the market is, obviously, can give us other prices
it needs to break the previous, uh high, create another lower low, give us the lower high
so it's a lot of things the market needs to do before i even going into to the trade, right? the market needs to give me the exact um what i look for before i choose to go into the trade
so just because i now see the market giving me the retails of the 50, this doesn't mean that this fibonacci level will be valid
you just might see the market pull back up and retest the previous resistance as they support, and then see the market continues back up to, potentially as the other targets on or the other coins that we looked at, because we've been doing the same thing on everything
now, we just might see the market pull back up to 05 thousand four hundred and ninety
this is where i look for, potentially then the market to reverse back down
so this is what i see right now on, do we have some people talking about political things? cardano
sorry if i miss anything, i'm just trying to go okay, so we can look at, uh, gr g l m, r usdt
so, uh, on glmr, we can pull back up to zero point six thousand nine hundred and eighty, potentially zero point seven thousand two hundred and ninety
yeah, it's pretty hard when we don't have anything else to look at, uh, in the previous um but, yeah, as i told you, i'm looking at zero point, uh, zero point six thousand nine hundred and eighty
so it's around these levels that i look for the market to potentially reverse back down from
it would we if we would see a bigger pullback to the upside, i'm looking at the previous support that we did break around 07845
we can pull back up, retest the previous support, turn it into new resistance, and then see the drop
i look for sell opportunities because the market is obviously in a huge downtrend
and that is also, if we would see the market pull back up to this resistance, a previous support
you can also see with this fibonacci that i took on the daily from high to low, uh, the 618 percent is at one point nine hundred and thirty dollars
so it's kind, i mean, the market connect connects everything very good
so we just have to wait and see where the market will reverse
crv usdt, oh, can you see? i mean, we did retest these levels, so good if we go back in time
so we're using the previous support that we didn't have the push from
ginger, oh, this looks so great when it comes to encouragement in making the correct choices in life
what is one one one, one one one is for beginners, just, uh, new beginnings
but what i use is this previous support and this amount of magnet yes
and i took fibonacci from zero point seven hundred and sixty seven back down to zero point five hundred and fifty fibonacci levels
i would love for the market to um, okay, so, i mean, we can, i can definitely wait for the market to break the support trend line, create the lower low, come back up, create the next lower high
but if i would see the market slowly, steady, you know, reverse back down, depending on how the candlestick is looking
um, this is where i, i can go into short positions at that moment
but first of all, i need to, i would wait for the market to break the support trend line, so i would see that this fibonacci level is valid
but another thing that we can also use, obviously, is this previous resistance that we do have around 06022
if we retest it from below, that can be the, uh, continuation back down
and after that, we, i think we definitely, uh, definitely, definitely will see the market reverse
do we have anything else that we want to look at? so john, i hope you you had your answered
um, even though i'm no financial advisor, guys, i only share what i see
i really try to, but there's so many people writing out, i don't want to sit and look at the charts for 10 hours
um, okay, but looking at ftm um, uh, first of all, we're gonna use zero point one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight
uh, we can definitely see the market push back up and retest its previous report around zero point two thousand nine hundred and forty four
i dragged fibonacci from zero point three thousand one hundred and sixty four, back down to zero point two thousand fifty eight
we are retesting, or we are slightly above fibonacci level 02 2 393, too
but it's monday, so the market can be, i mean, okay, so tomorrow the market doesn't, um, we just might not move so much tomorrow
but on ftm if we would see now that this fibonacci level is valid, same thing here, we just do the same thing over and over again
if we break below the fifty percent at zero point two thousand three hundred and thirty eight reaches from below, we can see the market create the next lower high and then see the continuation of the drop
we just might just see the market pull back down, retest the 50 and then see the market pull back up
if that is the case, i'm looking at 02 610, potentially 02 740
if we see the market, and on the higher time frames, you see the market reverse uh or consolidate
and we will look, we will look for alexander james johnson later, because i'm very grateful for to have you here
okay, so we are inside the fibonacci level on the three monthly
and so the first thing that i will do is that, um, we are right now retesting fibonacci levels between, uh, 211 dollars and 216 dollars
and this is also, uh, you know, where we can see the market reverse back down, slowly and steady
minus 12 is combined exactly with the, with this previous support that i also, uh, draw a drew, i'm sorry
if we break below, if we break below um, 209 dollars, create the next lower low
we're waiting for the market to pull back up to give us the next lower high
and if that's the case, if this fibonacci now will be valid, take profit one, 177 dollars
take profit to 153 dollars, and take profit three and 133 dollars
but that is only if i see the market break, break the support, create the lower low, give me a next lower high
and i mean, obviously the market could definitely, uh, the market could definitely, um, fake us out, right? but this is the thing, when it comes to trading, you're choosing to go in or you either give, you choose to have a loss or take profit
and if, if the market is not, even if the market gives me exactly what i need, it can definitely go against me
and that is definitely something that we always have to have in mind
that is why it's really important that we always stick to our, that is why it's really important that we stick to our, uh, to our strategy, and a good strategy
because a strategy doesn't always, it doesn't always work, but as long as it works, you know, more than i mean, at least more than 50 is good, right? and don't over leverage, because if you over leverage, it doesn't matter how many times you're in profit, because when you over leverage, in the time that you're in stop loss
it will just take away your, it would just take away the all of the profits that we, you know, got for ourselves
i don't even know if, uh, alexander is still here, but we will look at sc see a coin
so as long as we're below the trend line, as you can see on the weekly chart, we're definitely still in a downtrend, right? um
we're coming back down to the support around, uh, 295 dollars and to 320
this is, and you can, we can already see that we retested 318, but it looks the same as on the other coins
we do have this previous resistance that we can come a previous support around 408 dollars that we can retest
okay, so we came back up now where we tested 378 dollars and 390 dollars, and we saw the market, uh, retested
but we are still using, do you can we this is still a high low, but we're retesting the 50 again from below, right? and we are still above the trend line, which means that we can still see the market push back up on the lower time frames
if i would see us break below 363 around this level, that, for me, is a clear indication that this fibonacci level that you saw the market retested is actually valid, and that could take us back down to lower targets
but i wouldn't do anything unless i see the market create the lower high, lower low, come back up and potentially retest the pre the the support trend line, create the next lower high
we just might see the market pull back down to the support again
because you can, we can see that the market has been consulted, been consolidating in between 406 dollars and 322
so we just might see the market only give us a or you can see that we are been consolidating around, oops, this is a resistance
and if we break the law of 363 dollars, it can take us back down to the support at 316, and then it can actually take us back up again
so this is like short term trades, because that's what i look for
if we would break above 392, we can come back up and retest this preview support that i did take from the daily charts, and that is as 400 and around 418 dollars, 424 dollars
if we would break above that one, i look at the daily fibonacci at 460 and 490 dollars
and from these levels, you can see the market, or i can also see the market reverse back down from it
alexander, you also had something else, and that was sia, oh, isn't that? isn't the same, same one? maybe i was just mistaking it, but it looks like it

my name is josh, and there is good news for bitcoin here on the weekly bitcoin chart, as we're seeing this signal continue to play out
so i'll be talking about that in just a moment, alongside ethereum later in this video, which is starting to show some positive signs
so definitely make sure you stick around to the end of this video so that you don't miss out on any of this important information
first of all, starting off on the weekly bitcoin chart, and the next weekly candle close, which is coming up in just a few hours, is actually starting to look pretty good
because over the past one day, we have seen a bounce in the bitcoin price from around that 17 000 price level, which i've been talking about for the past three days
and this bounce in the bitcoin price over the past one day is obviously forming a massive wick in this weekly candle
and generally speaking, when we see a massive wick to the downside, that means there's a lot of buying demand in that region
and in fact, if you're looking at this entire weekly candle, just a massive red candle to the downside with a huge wick forming in the candle right now, this is looking very similar to the weekly candle that we saw back in the march 2020 crash
and i spoke more about that comparison between the current price action and the march 2020 price action in my last video on the channel that i posted yesterday
but what i said in yesterday's video is the fact that we're still yet to see a wick in this weekly candle
but obviously, since yesterday's video, over the past one day, we have now formed this week, which is great to see
and not only that, but looking at the weekly bitcoin rsi, this is still extremely oversold
but technically, the rsi is not confirmed into place until we see the weekly candle close, considering the rsi, by default, is calculated by candle closes
so once again, we have the weekly candle close coming up in just a couple hours, where we would likely confirm the lowest rsi print on the weekly time frame for bitcoin, which is actually a good signal for the price of bitcoin
but looking at the previous times where we've seen the rsi either oversold or very close to oversold, this is usually happening around the times where we see a macro bitcoin bottom, just a massive bottom in the bitcoin price action
and also, what we saw back in march 2020 was obviously a drop down towards that 300 week moving average, which is the blue line
we went down to around 17 and a half thousand instead of pretty much 17 thousands
but with that being said, going back to that march 2020 capitulation, after we saw that huge week to the downside, close to the 300 week moving average, we ended up seeing the weekly candle close slightly below the 200 week moving average
but basically the weekly candle close was much closer to the 200 week than it was to the 300 week
and right now we're seeing something similar, especially over the past one day worth of price action
and alongside all of that, what we are also seeing with this weekly candle close, coming up in a couple hours, is a massive spike in the weekly volume for bitcoin
in fact, on the majority of the big exchanges out there, we're currently seeing the biggest spike in volume on the weekly chance since the may 2021 crash
and what we saw towards the end of that may 2021 crash, which was actually quite similar to the end of the march 2020 crash, was a huge wick to the downside on the weekly charts
and once again, a massive spike in volume, like march 2020, and also like the bottom of the 2018 bear markets
but in that example, we didn't have as big of a wick to the downside
now, for those of you who have been watching my videos for at least the last one month or so, you might be wondering, well, what about this other spike in volume that we saw about a month ago? because obviously we did end up seeing a massive spike in volume about a month ago when luna collapsed, and we saw a capitulation in the bitcoin price down towards 25 000
and you could certainly make the argument that that was basically a false signal in the volume indicator, because obviously we did not bottom out at around 25 000
but once again, as i said, in my videos back then, you can even go back on the channel and watch if you want, i said in almost all of my videos back then that bitcoin still has room to the downside
also, at that time, a month ago, we hadn't yet reached the 200 week moving average where we usually reach towards the bottom of a bear market
and also, i was discussing in those videos that usually when we see a massive capitulation like this with a huge spike in volume, in the 2018 example and the 2021 example, we actually ended up forming one more lower low after we saw the capitulation with the spike in volume
so basically, because of those three reasons that i outlined over and over again in my videos, about a month ago, we technically had more room to the downside below 25k
and obviously, right now, in recent weeks, we have made a lot of use of that room to the downside
and so due to all of those reasons, this weekly candle is shaping up to look better than what we saw a month ago
because not only do we have a similar candle wick to the downside, like what we saw a month ago, and all of these other major bitcoin bottoms
but on top of that, the volume for this weekly candle is bigger than what we saw a month ago, which means even more bitcoin this week, in particular, has changed hands
it's not only that, but we've seen the bitcoin price drop below the 200 week moving average, close to the 300 week moving average, like march 2020
and we also have the weekly bitcoin rsi in oversold territories, which we did not see a month ago
and now, looking at the daily bitcoin charts, we actually got this signal right here, around a week ago, approximately
this right here, by the way, is the hash ribbons indicator, and basically it's derived from the bitcoin hash rate
and anytime we see this capitulation signal show up, that usually means we're about to see, or we are seeing, a pullback in the bitcoin hash rate
and this usually happens because the bitcoin price drops so low that for a period of time, the bitcoin miners, the people mining bitcoin, are essentially unprofitable because their electricity costs are costing more than the bitcoin that they are producing
and so when we see this happen, when we see a pullback, or a capitulation, if you want to call it that, in the hash rate or in the miners
we end up seeing some bitcoin miners turn off their machines, which reduces hash rate
but every 2016 bitcoin blocks mined, which is usually every two weeks approximately, we see what's called a bitcoin difficulty adjustment, where bitcoin basically reduces the difficulty if the hash rate reduces
so it makes it easier to mine at bitcoin, which then makes it more profitable to mine bitcoin
and then when we see that happen, we see the bitcoin hash rate go up, which is basically happening the majority of the time, almost all the time, the bitcoin hatch rate is increasing because, of course, computers are getting faster as well
and so the majority of the time, every 2016 bitcoin blocks, the difficulty adjustment is actually making it slightly harder to mine bitcoin as the bitcoin hash rate is going higher and higher
and that is to stop the bitcoin miners from mining a lot of bitcoin blocks all at once, and to keep that approximate 10 minute time interval between each bitcoin block
and so it's not very common to see the bitcoin minus capitulate
of course, it does happen from time to time, but generally speaking, it's a fairly rare event that we don't see too often, where, once again, we see a pullback in the bitcoin hatch rates once mining profitability is low
but when it comes to this hash ribbons indicator, before we can start flipping more bullish, we ideally need to see this blue buy signal pop up after we see a longer capitulation that normally lasts for around a few weeks on average, talking about two to four weeks or so
and once again, we have already seen this capitulation signal for roughly around one week
and if you want to know more about this signal and what it means for the bitcoin price moving forward, check out this video that i posted around a week ago titled huge signal just flashed
because in that video, i talked more about what this actually means for the bitcoin price moving forward
and now taking a look at the short term bitcoin price action here on the 12 hour chart right now, we're actually seeing a new bullish divergence form here on the 12 hour charts
and if we're looking at the last time where we saw a bullish divergence here on the 12 hour bitcoin chart
that was roughly around one month ago when we had that previous capitulation when luna collapsed
and not long after we formed that 12hour bitcoin bullish divergence, we also saw a bullish cross in the 12hour bitcoin macd
and right now we're getting close to a bullish cross in the 12hour bitcoin macd, but we're not there just yet
but we do have an active bullish divergence here on the 12 hour charts
so basically, when it comes to the shorter term price action, we could be in a very similar situation at the moment to what we're in roughly around a month ago, which means in the coming days would most likely see a lot of choppy, sideways price action
i wouldn't really be expecting a massive move in the bitcoin price, especially over the next couple days or so
and heading into the ethereum part of this video, here on the 12hour ethereum chart, the same thing as i just said for bitcoin can basically be repeated right here
because obviously here in the shorter term price action for ethereum, we're seeing a lot of similarities around this bullish divergence and this bullish cost in the 12hour bitcoin macd to what we saw roughly around a month ago, before we experienced a lot more choppy, sideways price action
and if you're zooming out to the weekly ethereum chart, what is great to see for this weekly candle close is, obviously a massive wick to the downside
but not only that, at the time of recording this video, the price of ethereum is trading back above the 382 fibonacci level, which is coming in at just above a thousand dollars
so once again, the next weekly candle close is in just a couple hours from the time of recording this video
and when we see the weekly kettle close confirm, if we see the price of ethereum at that time above a thousand dollars, or ideally above 1050, where, more specifically, this line is coming into play, then that would actually be very good news for ethereum here on the weekly chart
and also, the weekly ethereum rsi is currently in oversold territories
in fact, right now it's the most oversold we have ever seen in ethereum's entire price history
and once again, this actually gets confirmed in place at the weekly counter close in a couple hours
and now taking a look at the weekly ethereum versus bitcoin charts
and right now we're still experiencing a shortterm bounce from this upper training line of support, which is coming into play at around 0049 bitcoin per ethereum
but if we're looking at ethereum's only other bear market, which was the 2018 bear market, looking at the entire bear market compared to this bear market so far, i'm sure you can see just by this chart alone why i am still leading more bearish than bullish when it comes to the larger trend for ethereum versus bitcoin
now keep in mind, this is the larger trend i'm talking about, not these shortterm movements in the ethereum price
and also keep in mind this is for ethereum versus bitcoin, not a theorem against the us
dollar, which essentially means i do continue to expect the larger trends for ethereum to continue to underperform against bitcoin, especially while the overall crypto market is still in this bearish phase
and even in the most bullish scenario possible for the crypto market, where, let's just say, if the bear market bottoms and we see a massive bitcoin pump
even if that happens, one of the most bullish scenarios possible, we could still end up seeing ethereum versus bitcoin, it continue to pull back
because that is pretty much exactly what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market
because this bottom right here was the end of the 2018 bear market for bitcoin and ethereum against the us
but ethereum versus bitcoin continued one more major leak to the downside
because during that time period, both bitcoin and ethereum were actually pumping against the us
but during that time period in the crypto market, we saw bitcoin outperform ethereum, which is why ethereum vs bitcoin continued to crash
so basically, when the entire crypto market is in a bearish phase, basically when we're in a bear market, it's quite normal to see ethereum and especially the majority of the alt coin market underperform against bitcoin during the bear market
but then even when the bear market actually bottoms out and we start pumping back to the upside against the us
dollar, we still see alt coins and even ethereum underperform against bitcoin, initially
and then after we're bullish for some time, then the alt coins begin to gather momentum as more investors move away from bitcoin during the later stages in the bull market and decide to look for more risky bets in smaller, old queens
so that's just my perspective on the markets at the moment, based on the data that we have in front of us and based on my own experience in that previous 2018 bear markets, because i was in the markets during that entire time period
and make sure to check out this video popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
number one, we're going to talk about the bitcoin price drawdowns from the alltime high
we're going to be talking about a trend that i see on this chart
we're going to extrapolate the trend talk about what you would need to see in this cycle for the trend to remain true
and then we're going to move over to one bit of information that i want to spend a minute or so on, and that is the us
now, this chart, the bitcoin price drawdown from the alltime high, is very simple to understand
the pink lines you will see on the chart are the price drawdowns from the alltime high
and this correlates to the left side of the yaxis, where you will see the percent drops from the alltime high
if we look at the right side of the screen, and if we also look at this white line, this is simply the btc usd chart on a logarithmic growth curve scale, from when it initially started trading
and on the right side of the screen, on the yaxis, you will see the us
that is uh correlating to the price line at that moment in time
now, on the x axis, as always, as we have with all of our trading view charts, this is simply the amount of time that has passed when this chart is coming to fruition
so what you'll notice straight away with this chart, or at least in my opinion, what i what i notice is three major areas of capitulation
so really four massive data points that we have going from this period in time
now, what you will notice with this chart is, number one, if we look at the first drawdown that bitcoin witnessed, we had a drop of approximately 9268
now, the reason we're specifically looking at the percent drawdowns instead of the us
for example, you know, in the first cycle, when bitcoin dropped from, you know, approximately twenty or thirty dollars, uh, thirty dollars, and it moved all the way down to two dollars, you know, that was a 28 drop
and obviously, cycle over cycle of cycle, uh, the market cap of bitcoin is going to be a lot higher
you know, at some point in time, bitcoin could be one million dollars, and it could have a hundred thousand dollar drop, and it would only represent a ten 10 drop
so, uh, once again, to start with, we've got about a 93 percent drop in the first cycle
coming over to the second cycle, we have approximately, if i draw it right down to the bottom, we have approximately an 85 percent drop
so you will notice a general trend, uh, that is lining up over in these charts here
they always, you know, they, they seem to always drop by less of a percent terms, time over time over time
dollar valuation, but that is simply because the price is higher at that moment in time, because the market cap is higher
but nonetheless, the percent drawdown is a much better way of looking at what we've got going on right now
but what we can do is we can go over to trading view, and we can look, and we can see, uh, we can say, okay, you know, in the previous massive, massive drawdown from down here, we dropped 735 percent
and the reason why we're not drawing this draw down is because, you know, this dump here and then this pump and then this dump that we're witnessing is all part of the same cycle
so i'm interested in these cyclical drops from the first bear market, second bear market, third bear market, massive black swan pandemic crash, and then this bear market
so like i said, previous cycle, the last one we dropped was 735 percent
and if we come over to what bitcoin has done so far, we have now subsequently dropped 745 which is just over what we saw in the pandemic scale
which is, you know, quite worrying that we're actually dropping more than we did in the previous cycle
but what if you wanted to draw this from bear market, low, bear market, low, bear market low, and we weren't going to take into account the pandemic scan? now, i personally do think the pandemic crash should be taken into account
but, you know, as always, some of these charts are subjective
you know, some of you may disagree with me, that you wouldn't encompass the stage point
so i'd like to provide an alternative perspective and talk about what we would have to witness in terms of the bear market lows
and like i said, we subsequently dropped 836 percent, approximately
so if btc does not drop below, what was it 85 from this, from this cycle here, rather, we dropped 80, 83, 836
so if we, let's say, drop 83 percent, then this would mean bitcoin would be down here at 11 800
so, you know, according to this chart, as long as bitcoin comes back down to 11 800 and then has a strong bounce, then the cycle, bottom, over cycle, bottom, over cycle bottom would have played out nicely
i would also like to say, i do not think that we are going to drop down to 11 800
i would just like to highlight that within this chart, you know, we are already, you know, a very, very decent amount of the way to the downside
and subsequently, i do imagine that the bottom is definitely closer than the top
uh, i do not think that we're going to 10 000, or anything near that evaluation
over 7325 billion in btc losses have been locked in by investors spending cranes that were accumulated at higher price targets
now, if you want the full breakdown of this, then be sure to head over to glass node
so if you do want to head over to my my twitter at 618 underscore cowboy, because glass note does post quite a lot, then you will be able to find that over my profile
but what we see here very, very simply is, if we look at this massive pink line here, which is basically all we need to worry about
and also on the yaxis, you can also see, you know, in terms of the price in us
and this is correlating to the past three consecutive days, having 24 billion alone in losses
now, what you will notice with these as well is, not every single time, but predominantly, these mass, mass liquidations that we saw here, we at least had a bounce from it
this was not the bottom, but we at least saw a bounce from it
this liquidation, you saw a bounce from it, but it was not the bottom
and at this moment in time, you know, we're having super, super spikes, taking into new alltime highs in terms of the realized losses
in fact, if you are a seasoned veteran to my channel, you will already know that i tell you, i do the opposite of what retail traders do
and what do i mean by that? last year, every single retail trader, everyone in their nan was saying, bitcoin is going to a hundred thousand
so, you know, subsequently, the whole way we were capitulating to the downside
all the retail traders were saying, you know, this is still the same bull run
and if you watch my channel, you can see that i was telling you, look at this
i've been telling you that for the past couple of months, and, you know, our content has aged beautifully, unlike some other channels that have been chilling, that the bottom is in, the whole way down
now, the average retail investor, and i'm seeing it a lot recently, you know, they've gone from saying bitcoin is going to a hundred thousand, and now they're starting to say, bitcoins going to ten thousand
and i've been surprised how quickly the social metrics have just completely flipped on their head
from the average retail trader that, you know, buys crypto on coinbase, holds it in their coinbase account
doesn't know what a hardware wallet is, doesn't understand on chain metrics and the uh value proposition of bitcoin, hasn't read the white paper
they buy whatever's pumped up 100 that's the average retail trader
the institutional money does not let you know what they're doing
and if they do and they say, this is what we're doing, they're probably doing the opposite, to sucker you in to be exit liquidity, or something else like that
and subsequently, a lot of retail traders recently have been saying that we are now going to 10k
and because of that, i am now becoming more bullish than i have been in the past couple of months
and i think looking at the bitcoin realized losses and looking at the price drawdowns that we are currently massively, massively sitting in because we're in a mass capitulation event right now
and you can also see, if we're just looking at the volume, you know, normally these massive, massive volume weekly candles to the downside
and, you know, hopefully, uh, once again, i do not think the bottom is in yet
but i would like to highlight that this is one metric that i will be using, uh, to decide whether i will be buying lots of bitcoin or not
but if you're a veteran to my channel, you know that i've had a few different price targets, ranging from, uh, 18 500, which is the bitcoin cme gap, at the cme futures gap
i've also been looking at 16 500, which is the 300 week moving average
and i have been looking at the elliott wave, from our one wave
so if this market cycle was to remain true, and we are currently in a typical abc correction for the elliott waves, then we should bottom above the one wave, and we should bottom above 14 000
i hope you enjoyed today's video, short and sweet, but, yeah, that's all i've got
there's a lot of price data on some great places like glass node, which are signaling the bottom is in, or the bottom is closer than we think is i don't think the bottom is in, but as i've been saying on my channel, i'm not trying to buy the exact bottom
i think we're going to experience one last capitulation, and then the bottom will be in for bitcoin
[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
your bitcoin, as expected, did move down lower, made actually a lower low, as indicated today in the live stream
in the previous videos, i did not expect that the bitcoin correction was over
and i have to be very honest with you, this could now be the last wave down
so we've been talking about here, after this sort of wxy pattern, this triangle pattern in the wave y, that there would be another wave down
obviously, within that wave, you've got another five waves, which we counted
and we are now within these five waves in the last wave, which, again, has five sub waves
why target? because i gave you a target of 18 500, and there we are, you know
and i had a few comments today of people who are probably a bit frustrated
they, uh, they're like, um, ta doesn't work in in these circumstances
i think, honestly, on this channel, i think we've proved pretty well that even here, especially though that sort of micro counting that i do at the moment, it works pretty well
yeah, of course, it gets invalidated sometimes, but if you get it 70 80, right? i think that's damn good, you know
now, of course, i can't tell you if this is now it, yeah, because as long as we don't have bullish confirmation and have a five wave move to the upside, uh, i can't give you confirmation theoretically, and i'll get to that in a minute
but theoretically, this could, could theoretically just be the first wave of more downward moves
and that is all that currency at the moment, right? we've reached 18 500
we calculated here the length of the wave one to the wave to peak
uh, no, sorry, the length of the wave one to the wave four peak
so pretty much there are there about, yeah, depending on how accurate i did draw this
now, but why is this target? it is target because the wave five is often times the same length as a wave one
now, if this, there's no guarantee that the wave five now adheres to this price target and will bounce off from here
and now, when we reach a target, we always have to look at, what is the price doing now? does it seem like it's falling further? and they just said it, it seems to fall further
next target would then be the 200 percent at 17 500, or even the 2618, which is at 169 k
the other one here, 169 is, anyway, overlapping with a 786 fibonacci retracement level of the overall bitcoin move
and to be fair, if i look at that, and if i look at we've got a confluence here
we've got the 2618 fibonacci extension of the wave one, and we've got the 786 fibonacci retracement level of the overall bitcoin retracement here
that is the good confluence that we, like analysts, are looking for, right? okay, so i gave you two more targets, and these would be the next ones we're looking out for
um, so what do we have to expect next? um, as long as we are not making higher highs and higher lows, we're going with the trend, because the trend is our friend
but the 786 percent fitbit would be my personal guess here, the 169k level, and then to bounce off from there
because this way five here, i mean, the way five, even just the way five could extend
and as soon as we see a bounce here, then we can look further
but at the moment it seems to be, you know, maybe we're getting into capitulation
and to be fair, to be fair, i've been telling you that i do expect, for many altcoins another lower low
and as long as we're not seeing that lower low for the altcoins, um, i'm quite happy to drop further, because i want for some alcohol also here ada
and as long as they are not fulfilled, um, i'm happy for bitcoin to drop a bit further
um, and to be honest, everybody who, anybody who's short now should be happy, and everybody who wants to invest into bitcoin should be happy as well, because these will be amazing prices, you know
and how far is bitcoin really going to go? so i mentioned in the live stream today, 169 k is my personal guess at the moment
yeah, this is what i can sort of see at the moment, realistically
it is still part of the current scenario, um, but i would be lying if i told you i would have expected it this is really lower than i would expect
and therefore, you know, i try to give you always my honest view here
you know, in november, in november, what we could see back in november and december, it was like, below 286 k, all the way down to 20
and to be honest, we have come into that target area, spent a bit of time in there, and now we're just dropping a bit lower
but this is something that i pointed out many weeks ago, that everybody could prepare for
now, i don't i could be wrong, um, but and, and, you know, this is all still part of the current scenario
and in fact, a lot, a lot of elliott wave analysts, and in fact, most that i know, most elliott wave analysts, see the current move down as a wave 4
in my opinion, the log chart, especially if you do it long term view, the long term view, it distorts wave relationships
and in fact, it then would look like a way for what we're currently doing
in my opinion, we're coming down too much for away four, especially on the arithmetic chart
i don't know on the log scale when the wave four would really be invalidated
but the fact is, on the arithmetic chart, we've come into the price region of the wave one, which would have been here
i think in validation point here, on the low chart might be 138 k
i can have a look at that for you in the next video, if you want to let me know if you want me to chart out the log chart
i don't like to use a log chart because, you know, i've been telling you from, from, you know, my scenario back in november here, that we are in a wave 2, in my opinion, which so far has worked out
so there's no reason for me to change this scenario if we're still adhering to it
and in fact, it would be preferable if we are in a wave 2 because the wave 2 comes down lower than the wave 4
and in wave 2, we cannot be happy, because the next wave would be something that we've never seen before
it would be the wave 3, which would be normally the most bullish wave
and because the next one would be a wave three, i'm not believing in the long bear market
so we are going to look a little i gave you the key support levels
um, of course, talking about a reversal, it doesn't feel like reversal time at the moment, for some reason
but um, as soon as we see a reversal here, which could then be the lowest point and the the five wave move to the upside, of course, make you aware
um, what? what did actually bitcoin in the last bear market retraced to? and yeah, we can draw here the fibonacci retracement tool for the last bear market
and again, it came into the region between that 887 fip level and the 786, so between 2365 and 4334
that is the area where you would normally expect most, in most wave twos, bitcoin and altcoins and generally assets, to retrace into in a wave two
this was also a wave one and the wave two, and it recovered from there
and this is the area that i highlighted for altcoins as well in the current bear market, to retrace now, to retrace to and to find a reversal, ideally, yeah
for some in january, when they reached their, their nearly alltime high, like phantom
but again, bear in mind, i told you six months and before before that we would get there, which oftentimes didn't really see likely to be fair
but here what would that mean for bitcoin if that happened again? it would mean bitcoin would go into the region between 10 652 and 16907
now, on the other hand, bear in mind that every cycle volatility should reduce, so in my opinion, that reduces the likelihood we actually drop below the 786 fib level
at the moment um ideally, in my opinion, we should turn around, at the latest, at the 169k level
yeah, i'm open to lower prices all the way down to the 887 percent flip level, because it's all part of a wave 2 scenario
now, i personally, however, wouldn't have expected bitcoin to get to that level now
because, uh, i would have expected it for the altcoins that are more volatile, not for bitcoin
that is why i charted bitcoin's target area below 286 k, but above 20k, but six months ago, seven months ago
so summary, lower prices still very likely, as long as we're falling anyway
and i also can't tell you if this will mean this year might actually only be the first wave of another five wave move down, because this is, unfortunately, what we need to see
only when we have the first five wave move up, we can be certain that the low is in
and as long as we don't see a bullish reaction anyway, we can't tell
and i won't tell you that this is the low until we see bullish confirmation, until we see buddhist divergences, which, in fact, we are seeing on some indicators

uh, so if you like that we talk a little bit about bitcoin today and maybe some altcoins, please, please hit the like button
um, for everybody who's um, for every new member, maybe on the channel
this is just a public live stream, which i normally don't do, but i'll do it today because of, yeah, what bitcoin is doing, you know, sort of, um, first time, broken below the previous bull market high, broke below the 200 week moving average and might not get back above it this week
then the member live stream will be tomorrow at five o'clock utc
uh, what i'd like to do is talk a little bit about bitcoin, talk a little bit about some of the indicators around bitcoin, and maybe some altcoins
um, but i know a lot of people have also already asked the last few days about a live stream
um, and i thought, look, we'll just do a live stream and talk a little bit about a few things, talk about my thoughts around bitcoin, and i try to answer your questions as well, even though in a public live stream it's always very, very difficult because there are many more people like in the member live stream
um, however, i try to, uh, if you hear the dog in the background, sorry, but no, i try to
um, i limited also the, you know, how often you can send the message to 30 seconds, because otherwise it will just get too overwhelming
so we'll have a quick look at bitcoin latest movements since the last video
and then i want to cover a few things in the indicators, because it is very important and share a few of my thoughts, and then we can take a look at some of the altcoins
but please hit the like button because, you know, this is sort of the way to support this channel, which is amazing
i'll try to grow the channel, of course, and try to bring this message, obviously, to to other people, because i believe there's much, to, too much hype in the crypto space, too much fear, too much greed, you know, all sorts of things here, which, which, uh, just isn't, you know, we try to look at this in a, in an objective way, in logical way, you know, to keep the emotions aside
and i believe that that's the best way for your mental wellbeing, because there are so many channels who hype things, and it's always about, you know, the next big thing
what is interesting though that obviously, it seems to work out right
we even moved a little bit lower than than the target, which was here the um 1618 fib extension
so this is always very important for a wave 3, that it ideally reaches the 1618 fibonacci extension, which it did
and when it goes above below that, the next main target would be the 200 percent
and if it reaches that and goes below that, it would be the two point six, one, eight
now it did reach the two hundred percent, as you can see here, bounced off, moved up
and what you would normally expect after wave three is then, of course, a wave four retracement
now the way for retracement is you measure that by just calculating the length of the wave 3, which means you go from the high of the wave to here, the beginning of the wave 3, to the low of the wave 3 with your retracement tool
and you can see that it reached perfectly, absolutely perfectly, the 382 fibonacci retracement level, which is, for a way, for the ideal, the perfect retracement, really
so what you would normally want in a wave for is also, it's a three wave structure, so you want to be able to count an a, a, b and a c
which means, i find it quite likely that we will go a little bit higher in this wave four, which would be confirmed above nineteen thousand five hundred dollars
and the target would then be nineteen thousand, 19743, which is the next ideal target for a wave 4
if it goes above that, it might not be a wave 4 anymore, yeah
but primarily, i would say, because if we don't see the three waves, yeah, the 19743 would, uh? so, yeah, 19743 would definitely be be a realistic target
because, as you can see here, one more wave is actually missing
now, i would say one more wave is missing to finish off this overall bitcoin correction
this could really be the last wave down, that fifth wave here, because it is the fifth wave of a fifth wave of a fifth wave, blah, blah
you know, it really finishes off all of this, all of this higher level
go to the daily chart, it would finish off all of this daily um or the whole correction, it could finish off
now, this is not guaranteed, but it is a really high probability for a few reasons
and i want to talk about that, um, leaving all the macroeconomic factors aside, because i don't really want to include them in any ta
how far would the last wave down go? and before we go to the indicators, i just want to cover that
so, um, it's one target, and there are a few ways how to measure that
and one target for a wave five is just the length of the wave one
and if we measure the length of the wave one, it would take us to eighteen thousand hundred
around about, yeah, eighteen thousand five hundred that is the first target, eighteen thousand five hundred for the wave five
and my view is, if we go below that, then the next target is the 786 fibonacci retracement level of the entire bitcoin corrective move
because this is for such a wave in which we currently are, the higher level wave 2 that you can see here, an ideal level, that is the 169 k level, 786
okay? i don't find it very likely for a few reasons, and we'll get to them now
so few things here to say, i think we are close to completing this correction, but it could be, again, one more drop, and and maybe, and maybe, we just, we crash below the 16 900, but it might only be a quick week, yeah, quick, quick, a very brief top drop below that, okay? and then it might just stay there for a few hours
and, and if you then see a very strong reaction back above the 786, yeah, such like a vshape recovery, i would be very, very convinced that that might have been the low, depending on the structure then
but for me now this is really looking like the last wave down
because what belongs to calling the low is to find out how do we actually move out of this? what is the reaction of the price to a certain price point? for example, here the eighteen thousand five hundred dollar level
yeah, if it is bullish, that means we see a strong move up, we cut through certain resistance levels, and we see a five wave impulse to the upside, then there's a good chance that was it
but if we only see a three wave move up, which would be of corrective nature, it could really be that we will have another five wave move down
so don't be surprised if we go down here, see a reaction, but it will be such a it will just be like an abc up
okay? and i'm gonna tell you, sorry, there will be another five wave move down
so, however, there are certain certain hints that we can that we have obviously, like the seventy eight point six percent flip level at sixteen thousand nine hundred dollars
but also, very important a few other factors, which i want to talk about, fee and greed index, six
now, this doesn't necessarily mean we need to go up tomorrow, but it indicates a trend reversal, because this is the place where normally sentiments starts to shift
so this is fear and greed index, and also a few other things that are really important to point out here, some of the charts from look into bitcoincom, which i find so important
i've never really talked about the rainbow chart, but it is so important as well, um, because it covers that, um, logarithmic growth curve
so here, um, you can see that this is sort of a log scale chart
okay? and then they have categorized different phases of market sentiment into different colors
and i find that's so important, because with the elliott wave method, you're also capturing market sentiment really and when you're pretty much finished with your five wave move that is normally when sentiment shifts again
so you can see here, from the whole history of bitcoin, different phases down here, for example, when you're in the red phase, then it's actually time for selling
but when you're down here, where we currently are, i mean, long term, if you look at that, you all you needed to do is to look at the colors
so if you bought in the, let's say, the green territory, and you just saw it in red, without looking at anything else, you would have made a fortune
you know, the last in the last category, which would be fire sale
at the moment, we are still in by and i zoom in a little bit more, it could mean, with today's move, it could mean, with today's move, we actually broke, uh, it might not have been updated yet
i think with today's move, we might have gone into fire sale territory
and again, it doesn't mean it moves back tomorrow, but it means we are seriously, seriously in very, very low territory and actually in a buying area
but don't don't, um, don't expect it to move the up immediately
yeah, you can see that we were actually very, very low in that blue area, very low, but only for a short period
what is a really good indicator is if we go into it and then move out of it again, in my opinion, yeah, so, uh, but it is fireside
it means that the value compared to um what it should be, is really, really low, and it indicates a reversal soon
now, what else do we have here? the uh, logarithmic growth curve as well, which we talked about in member live streams before, here as well, only very, very briefly
and we are seriously, very, very low compared to where the band, actually, the lower band is
so again, here, compared to where we, oops, no, compared to where we were in the past
the only time i see on this chart where we actually seriously dropped below that level was, again, when covet hit, which was here
but again, as long as we don't see the trend reversal, it could still go further down
but i just want to indicate on this, in this live stream, that we are really, really in interesting territory, especially long term
um, but as long as we don't see the confirmation of the price to go up, we we can't really call the low
and then we can take maybe a look at eth and some other altcoins
is which one was it? here's a two year m a multiplier again here
and i don't want to explain them all, but this is basically a two year moving average here in green
whenever we were below the two year moving average, again, buying time, yeah, based on this indicator, you know, financial advice also, they say the indicator is no financial advice
but, um, we have come here, also, in that area, again, below the 200 a week two year, multi two year moving average
again, what is so important about this is, though, that we've actually stayed, always, quite a while below that level, uh, with the exception of when covet hit
maybe you know that we were below that level, um, which is actually good for for anybody who wants to accumulate
isn't that what we want? it's so paradox in financial markets, people always want higher prices, but when you go into the supermarket, you want cheap prices
but here it's, for some reason, it's the opposite in financial markets, even though you should think like that
you know, the longer it stays at this price level, the better
but i know how it is, you know, it's always difficult, um, but yeah, we've come below this band
and again here, when you bought below the band, below the green band, and then you sold when it peaked above the red band, you've made a fortune, you would have
so again, here, all these indicators, they really point towards a possible reversal soon, um, and especially the fear and greed index, which is so, so low
and what is so interesting as well is that, um, where do i find those? indicate bitcoin wallet sizes
they are not really selling, yeah, they are just, you know, who's selling at the moment? selling? people who've been holding bitcoin for less than a year
that is what brings the price down, actually, the whales they are holding, yeah
and some of them even accumulating, um, and that was just sort of an overview of bitcoin here
i don't know, but maybe this wave 4 is peaked, and we are going to see here the wave 4 go down into the wave 5, actually
um, yeah, let's take, what, have a quick look through the chat
but really, i actually wanted to do this only like half an hour, 15 minutes already, um, gone
um, but, yeah, um, please hit the like button because, you know, i'm not trying to sell you any sort of leveraged thingies
again, i can't answer all the questions, unfortunately, in this live stream, because it's just, we want to update you really share my thoughts, um, because there's so many questions
a lot of people wanted me to have a look at solana, but i think i covered solana earlier in the video
let's have a quick look, because that's what the live stream is for
so the only, the only way you can make this work now, yeah, um, obviously we've moved up in this way for in in pink
now this cannot be a wave three anymore, because we have come up too much, um, into the or at least the wave three isn't finished yet
okay? it cannot cut really into the price range of the wave one
it could now be a wave one two, one two, which points towards an extended wave three
that you have a wave one two and another one two, which would then, again, both of these require a wave three underway four
so it will just mean, um, it really is interesting what's going to happen here now, because all these altcoins, they've actually been holding really well compared to bitcoin
this is interesting, what's gonna happen now, in the next few days
but as long as we are below this ascending trend line, i think we could certainly see this as resistance at around 3160
so talking about a possible breakout for solana, which, honestly, at the moment, is, at any time, possible
um, but as long as we are below this descending channel, descending trendline, yeah, i i can't talk about a breakout
um, this would be definitely something like a sentiment shift
if we break above the descending trend line here, of this channel in which solana is, um, even better would be a price move above 4196
but then you're already talking about, from where we now are, something like a 60 increase
you know, when this correction is really over, you're gonna see 10, 20 percent a day for some of these coins
i bought bitcoin here a few days ago for, um, 20 and a half k
i bought eve for, i think, 1050, and made the channel members aware, because i'm not
you can't, you can't, um, you cannot um time the market in that way
because if you try to to buy at the lowest point, you either need to be lucky, uh, yeah, or lucky, you know
because you can really only confirm that the low is in afterwards
um, there are price targets we can define, but we cannot say in advance that this is already
then the end, we need to see how the price is reacting to a certain price target to come to the next possible conclusions and make assumptions
but again, for that, we need to see the reaction of the price, like here
yeah, you know, by all means, this could have been the low, but i don't think so
but even if it was, i would want to see significant price action above this descending channel to call the low
which doesn't mean i wouldn't buy already, because prices have come down like 85 to 90 percent for some coins, even more
now, if it really goes towards the 95 i'm really adopting that the coin might ever recover in a significant way
um, again, i don't think the low is in yet, but it's certainly interesting what the price is doing, because it's coming up quite a lot
and i'll think about this afternoon, if there's another way of counting this
we've made a lower low compared to the previous one, and if we now make a lower high also here, it's probably going to turn to the, to the downside
um, the other thing where i think there will be a swift recovery, you know, again, and another dip expected, but then swift recovery, i think, dude, because everybody's expecting now, like the 10k is, everybody started to call the 10k below 30k
when we drop below 30k for bitcoin, a lot of people were like, okay, we're now going to go to 10, 15k
um, now again, it's, it's a bit like what we had back in, uh, november, october
talked about the risk that we will get to a threedigit ethereum when we dropped below 1700
and again here as well, um, broke out of the triangle to the downside
i was thinking to myself, wow, this is going to be interesting, because you saw it, it was squeezed that much
i mean, it couldn't just have moved on, it was squeezed that much
therefore, i posted on twitter this morning, it will be an interesting weekend
now, you never know in which direction, but the primary expectation was down trend, continuation pattern
the market was even that weak that it didn't even reach the wave 2 target area up here
it just shows the weakness in the chart, you know, in the market
so this was then probably the wave too high, or if it was a triangle, probably back here
and again, target here, for we can just use the triangle height for example
um, target is, if we add it to the breakout point for all of that, around about 836 dollars
um, but again, is one way of measuring it and giving us an idea
now, in contrast to bitcoin ethereum has already dropped below that 786 fibonacci retracement level
and this, again, only in significant or in in critical circumstances, or maybe just a far very fast week, you know, going down and recovering quickly
one more thing i wanted to show you for bitcoin, very important as well
one is, if we add the vpvr, so like the historical volume, onto the chart, and just need to zoom in to the right, um, to the right level here here, so you can see this, this red line here, which is a volume spike
so throughout the whole 20 to 286 k area, there wasn't really much
and then here below 20k, it started again at like 19 and a half k, and it goes down all the way to around about, um, yeah, 17k
it's a good, good, um, chance for for the price here to to reverse to the upside um
but again, we need to wait for confirmation to to really call the law here
and, um, yeah, this sort of is is it? so i'll have a quick look at, um, any of your questions
again, i didn't want to make it much longer than half an hour, unfortunately, because, um, you know, it's, it's been a few busy days
so in my primary expectation, yes, i still think we will have another lower low for solana as well, and actually for most altcoins as well
one reason of why a lot of the altcoins didn't drop that much, i think because they they already and this, that is exactly what we talked about, i think, last week
couple of weeks ago, where the altcoins crashed so much and bitcoin didn't
now, we talked about that the altcoins might already preempting what bitcoin is going to do in the next couple of weeks
and there you go, the altcoins not dropping, but bitcoin dropping
yeah, again, if you enjoy the live stream, then please hit the like button
it's really, really, uh, a lot of work here, i put into the channel as well
obviously, maybe triggered by someone who wanted to manipulate the market down a little bit
and all it needs is one of these moves and it it can push the market into one one scenario
a few other people signed up for channel, memberships during this live stream, who might
they don't, uh, cost a lot, but i think only positive feedback
so if you're interested at all in joining, join the discord telegram, feel free to do it
you know, let's have a quick look of what the coins in general are doing at the moment
but i, you know, i wouldn't have expected the weekend to start like that
i mean, last weekend we had already that significant move down
for some reason, at the moment, these moves happen on the weekend
it is quite funny though, um, and quite interesting, because normally saturday sundays have been quite quiet, yeah
and then we've seen, usually, so towards the the end of sunday, you know, towards the weekly candle close, we've seen quite a bit of volatility, uh, quite a bit of movement
now, okay, that is sort of now happening on the weekend, which is makes it interesting, right? so, yeah, you can see very clearly here, bitcoin, minus seven, minus seven
you can see through the higher market cap cryptos b and b, going down quite significantly, whereas the other ones
now, okay, they are going down as well, but i think what it is, they recovered much more in the last few days, so it doesn't really, they are not necessarily make new swing lows at the moment, whereas bitcoin obviously did today
um, any significant moves here? now? they're all sort of around the um four to minus ten percent
but not really too interested in that, because i think it doesn't have any limit
yeah, by the way, i'm thinking about, maybe in the future, trying to to stream on theta as well, maybe once a week or so
um, i will publish more videos today anyway, but i don't really necessarily want to drag on that live stream for much longer
um, because in the end, i'm just gonna have a look through the different coins
but if we want to align it with the other coins, so we can count it like that, we can also count bitcoin as five waves complete, but to align it with bitcoin
but then again, you know, i'm looking at the chart and think, right, was this really five waves down? because i can't count five waves up, so i can only count three waves up, which indicates, all right, those five weren't complete indeed
so it makes it likely this was the wave four corrective move up, which also exactly came to the high or to the low of the wave one
had it gone any higher, it would have invalidated wave one, or this whole down move
it did adhere to the elliott wave rules, because the wave four can't really easily cut into wave one
so that could have been quite a large, there were quite a large wave for though
and this could have been, again, wave one down wave two, waiting for more downside potential
looking at the indicators, i think they are fairly oversold anyway, all of them are
looking at dot as well, still in this target area i defined back in november, again, between that six dollar level, i believe it was, or 560, and here 11 or something, it was, again, between these two fib levels, between the 887 fibonacci retracement level and the 786
and that is the area where, already in november december, i expected the correction to finish for polka dot
so it will be very interesting if, if polka dot listens and will actually really finish off the correction in this area
key support here for for polka dot is that 560 level, that is the 887 percent flip level
but would be, it would be awesome to just turn around from here
so again, what we need for confirmation is just a five wave move up, an impulsive move up
have a look at eve just we looked at eve didn't we? but let's take a look
eve eth would be, you know, we can count, we can calculate the length as few targets we can calculate here
so we can calculate the length of the wave one and add it to the high of the wave four
um, one more way of calculating this might be to take the just don't want to delete the wrong stuff here
then we can also take just the height of the triangle here, this was a triangle pattern, and we can take the widest point of the triangle and add it to the breakout point to get another target
where does that go that i actually need to add it to the lowest point of the triangle
and if even we break below that, then it would be the um, eighty eight point seven percent fib level
i can't tell you which one the price will adhere to, unfortunately
but as long as we keep an eye on all of them and we see how the price is reacting to them, if you see a strong bounce from one of these levels, that could have been the the low
and then obviously, when it reverses here, the potential for eth in the next bull run
i mean, we're talking here about, i think, uh, you know, we're talking about even for eth
we talk about now, uh, something like an, uh, here there is actually the extensions, i still have them on the chart, the 1618 extension, that would be, you know, here we've made the wave one
based on the elite wave method, we need to make an alltime high for that, yeah, otherwise it could just be a corrective wave up
but if we make a new alltime high in the next bull run, the wave three should take us to at least eight thousand seven hundred dollars
so i wouldn't be surprised to even go a bit higher than that, possibly the two hundred percent extension here, just above ten thousand
the 1618 extension 403, that's the target for in the next bull run, for an alltime high
target for ethereum, above eight thousand seven hundred thirty nine
so honestly, one of the calmest and most positive communities
honestly, in the past i've been part of so many other crypto communities as well, it's usually, you know, hype
someone wants to sell you something that, you know, selling is not bad, but it's always like those bibit links and pushing people into leveraged trades, people who have no clue about it
yeah, we have a quick look at engine, but i think after that, i'll probably close this live stream
and also here, if we go to the one hour chart, similar wave pattern, it even made, it even made a lower low compared to the one from the 13th of june
but if we count it like that you can now count here for engine yeah, exactly
bitcoin hasn't done it because for bitcoin, we're still waiting for that fifth wave to play out, isn't it? here? fifth wave could be technically complete
low could already be in, but it's stupid to say that without having the evidence
and realistically, it's probably not yet in, because on this move down, we can only count one, two, three
there's probably more to come on the way down here for um, for engine absolutely now
and if we again looking at possible target, taking the length of the wave one, adding it to the wave four, and here it is, normally, again, the 100 extension of the wave one
so next logical target would be the 200, which is at 378 or 339
well, i know coins kid, but i don't know him, if that makes sense
which chart did i use? that's the question now, cuz i looked at dogecoin in the last few days, but i can't remember which, which chart i used
talked to, uh, someone booked a zoom call with me a few days ago and asked me to look into dogecoin
and we, we talked about dogecoin, and said, yes, wave four probably complete up here
and also here, very, very similar to bitcoin, i would let's just compare it to bitcoin once more
bitcoin chart here, one, two, three, four, five, waiting for the fifth wave
also here, you can count after the wave e high, which was here
um, then ideally, then five should actually go below five cent, ideally
um, well, the question is, you know, we can count this, all right? one, two
if that was the wave three here, then we can count this as wave four, and that way five
um, so it also hasn't really dropped below the low of the wave three
um, personally, i think we will see here still a move below five cents for dogecoin, but, you know, from here
um, i can't remember how or why, but apparently in the past, i calculated here target of 38 cents for dogecoin
so here we had, um, it's more around the four cent range, isn't it? so where we currently are, you can see that area here, back in february 21
so that is where we currently are going, all the way down to around about four cents
so if it goes below that, there isn't much more in terms of support
um, i thought they, they're going to send something into the don't they? don't they send this? um, isn't elon sending this rocket up in in august? that's sort of paid with dogecoin or something? i heard about it
you want to buy the trading video? course, you get the 15 off
i will publish a monero video today because someone bought a ta from me, and i will publish that on youtube for everybody
and i've seen someone asking for me chain, so i'll try to push out the v chain update today as well
[Music], hello, and welcome to another update video about bitcoin
um, wanted to get the previous bitcoin video out quite quickly, and now we have a little a chance to look at what is actually happening here
um, so, yeah, as as my primary expectation outlined already, we would break out of this triangle to the downside
and we've already come to the, into the target area of that wave three
so obviously, on the 12th of may, we came down here in, um, no, sorry, that was, it was the 14th of june
that was, that was on that, on the other chart, now here on the 14th of june
and then after the wave e peaked, we started to move down in a wave one
this is pretty much complete, because we reached, you know, we, we definitely reached here, the the target for a wave three, anyway
and i and now it might be worth measuring that way for retracement
i can pretty much tell you without measuring that this is probably already the minimum requirement fulfilled of the wave four
because what you would normally see in a wave four is the the twenty three point six percent fibonacci retracement level
we then moved all the way to the thirty eight point two percent, which is the ideal level, four, away
so from from what um or even here? no, if i make it even even a bit more accurate, we've hit it perfectly
but you can see how relevant the 382 percent fib level was here at 19 511
so i just moved that a little bit lower to really cover the entire week
well, since then, we've already seen a bit of a reaction to the downside
i mean, i can't really count three waves in the wave four yet, so not on the one hour chart
so it could be that we see here a little bit more upside in the wave four, maybe to the fifty percent fib retracement at nineteen thousand seven fifty, certainly possible
yeah, i wouldn't rule out, though, that we go down straight away
the confirmation for that, though, would not be obtained until we break below really 18 735
and then we can also calculate the length of this wave five, at least one target for that wave five would be, if we take the length of the wave one, again, um, and add it to the high of the wave four, then we get as a target
yeah, the first target would be here, 18 575, if the wave 4 doesn't go any higher, and that would be a target for the wave 5
if we go below that, next target would be the 1618 fibonacci extension at pretty much eighteen thousand dollars
so somewhere at least what we can see now, somewhere between eighteen thousand and eighteen thousand five hundred, we should actually complete that wave five
um, as i said, it's currently possible that the wave 4 isn't finished yet, because we normally, you see your abc quite clearly here
so we should see maybe a little bit more upside in um, in another wave up and, yeah, it could definitely go to 50 percent fit retracement at 19750, and then we could go down from here
you know, it is quite a weak market at the moment, so i wouldn't be surprised to go down straight away to either 18 575 or 18 000
should we go below 18 000, my target would be the 16 900 level, which is the 786 fibonacci retracement level 4
um, yeah, for bitcoin, for bitcoin, which is, um, yeah, that one, another 786
now, if we lose that level, i mean, there are some support levels along the way, like here, 13783, that swing high
but let's just assume for now, until until the level isn't broken, it doesn't really make makes sense to speculate where we're going
and also, what is worth noting, obviously, for the first time in history, bitcoin is broken the high of the previous bull market, which was here in 2017, and which was around 19 800
we also below the 200 week moving average, um, which is, let me just add that onto the chart, this red line, we've broken below that
my understanding is, and it could be wrong, correct me if i'm wrong, but in bitcoin's history, we've never seen a weekly candle close below the 200 week moving average
no guarantee, but i don't think we'll see it break above that level on this weekend
so it could be the first candle close below that level as well
and, um, that is something else that is definitely note worthy
we bitcoin has done everything it needs to do in this current correction
yeah, definitely a realistic level for a wave two to bounce off
because this was a wave one, coming all the way up into, uh, april 2021
um, and in this wave two, yeah, one, definitely one target that you get
but for me it was quite, uh, would have been quite, you know, that 20k level
um, obviously, when i defined that target error between 20 and 286k
like seven months ago, i wouldn't have thought that we would, we are really going to break below 20k, but it became very realistic in the last few weeks
and, um, i've always outlined the risk that we could also go to that 786 fip level now, the 887 at 10 650, i don't think so
interestingly, we can see that, but that would be the worst case, absolutely the absolute worst case
um, it would seriously, seriously surprise me if bitcoin dropped below that level, below 10 652
um, it's pretty much everybody who's giving up, isn't it? so we'll see, we'll see
um, but nevertheless, what is important is today that a lot of altcoins aren't actually going, aren't actually seeing that much of a drop
yeah, so, even though ethereum made the the three digits, but, um, yeah, it's certainly an interesting day
uh, definitely, for everybody who's been following this channel, because i've never called the low
i said, yeah, the low could be in now at any time, but primarily still down
yeah, the shorter timeframe, elite wave counts still suggest an another lower low
and the next low here, that fifth wave, which we might already be in, you know, or just finishing off this wave four, going into the wave five, maybe later today or this weekend
this is certainly what we'll decide, if we are finishing off the overall correction here, or if there will be another iteration after this, another five wave structure down
i hope not, but it's not guaranteed at this stage that this is already the last wave down
and we also don't know if the next waves up, the next wave pattern up, will be only a three wave move which would be corrective, or will it be an impulsive move up, which would then suggest that the trend is changing to the upside? i'll definitely keep you updated

[Music], yeah, hello, and welcome to another video about bitcoin
well, as we go into the weekend, just finished my theorem video, told you that we'll probably have another move down um, as indicated with this triangle, and with bitcoin as well
we were waiting for the breakout below the low of the wave b in our two primary scenarios
you know, either way, which one will it doesn't matter which one
we had here the first triangle, abcde to break out below the low of the wave e
so, no, you finish the wave e, and then you break below the wave of b
and then the other scenario was finishing up the wave 4 here, and this was running flat
and that means that we have now, this was just the wave one, this was the wave two, and we are now in this wave three
makes it very, very likely, because the wave 3 is purely oftentimes the strongest, the longest one
this is exactly what we see here, forecasted by the elliott waves in both primary scenarios
and again, i gave you, uh, did that give you a price target? let's just double check what the price target for the wave 3 is
but i can tell you straight away, we either did go above it, or so below it, or we um, yeah, 192 k um, based on this one, because we are measuring here to the high of the wave two, and the length of the wave one, to the high of the wave to one point six, one eight fib extension
i don't think i talked about that target in the last video, but this is what you would expect in a wave three, in yellow here, to reach, which is basically now
then we would expect away four retracement and another y5 down
yeah, we are oversold on various time frames, absolutely on the weekly
um, here, bitcoin futures, i posted in the, in the in the telegram group earlier
um, the sentiment is so oversold, it's never been that way never, never, never, in the entire history
which just indicates that a reversal of the sentiment is coming
this could be what we're just seeing here, the last wave down
yeah, still think there should be a way, four up and away, five down
um, i'm not telling you this is the low without having confirmation
and i need to see what happens now, because we want to see the response of the market to this move
and i just really wanted to do a quick update here, because we now need to wait until the dust has settled
but this could already lead to a counter reaction now, and could push prices up again
i posted this morning on twitter as well, it will be very interesting weekend
and yeah, again, any low can now be the last one, as it was already up here
any low can be the last one, but without bullish confirmation, we have to assume we are going lower
i mean, there are various different targets in this range here, yeah, but an absolute key target is the sixteen thousand nine hundred dollar level
that is the seventy eight point six percent fibonacci retracement level
but, um, again, we just need to wait for this structure to play out
primary expectation would now be that, for me personally, as i can see it at the moment, that because we drop below 20k, we have a little bit more downside potential, that if this is the wave 3 that might be finished now, then there will be a bit of a wave for retracement
that would finish off all the sub waves here of bitcoin's correction
um, should we, as a response to that five wave move in yellow here, only c a three wave move up? that indicates that there will be another five wave move down? okay, so that is what we need to wait for the reaction of the market as soon as we have a finished five wave move down here
so again, there will be one more retracement in a wave four, then there will be a wave five in yellow
and the response of the marker to that will give us a clue if we are going to see an abc up
so three wave move up only, and then another five wave move down, or is the next move and that is what i think everybody hopefully wants, because we have come down a lot now
that is a first good indication that we are starting to move up
either even if the low could have been in here already, but it was not high confidence, not my primary expectation
update you later as soon as the death the dust has settled a little bit and we can see a little bit more structure in this

[Music], what is up, my crypto legends? how is everyone doing? hope you're having a fantastic saturday, guys
let's take a look at the charts, because bitcoin is in massive capitulation mode
now it seems like that 12 000 bitcoin is not too far off for that potential target, that bearish macro target that we were talking about, that, you know, was a possibility to hit those levels
we're not that far away from twelve thousand dollars away, uh, for twelve thousand dollars around about seven thousand dollars away from 12k
are we going to manage to hit those levels in the next coming weeks? this is something that we are going to discuss in today's live stream, guys, because it is looking very, very scary for bitcoin
how is everyone doing? i hope you all having a fantastic saturday
we've actually retested this range on bitcoin, okay? even below that level
we had a major daily level also that i want to talk about today
remember, i was in a small, long position, okay? i got stopped out from a position that i did enter here at the twenty thousand seven hundred, twenty thousand seven hundred dollar range
but this is why we do have a stop losses, okay? stop losses are your friends
because if you don't have any stop loss, and you have a liquidation price, and you are going to add up to your position until the price turns around, then right now you are probably in a huge, massive loss if you didn't get liquidated
this is why you have a stop loss because if i would still be in my position here that i did enter at the 28 700 area, i would be in a huge, massive loss right now
and am i going to handle this? are my emotions going to handle this? no
i prefer to risk about 1 or even less of my capital, so then i just get stopped out, and then look for the next trading opportunities, of course
a lot of people will add up to their position, uh, put their liquidation price lower, or use more margin, um, deposit more margin, if you're using margin trading
and this is extremely dangerous, because the possibilities on bitcoin coming down to twelve thousand dollars right now is very, very high, guys
and actually, we do not have any volume at all, hardly on the vpvr
the biggest volume that we do have on the vpvr starts here around about the 12 000 area, where it was a big, massive resistance back in 2019
if you zoom in here on the chart and you check out vpvr levels, big spikes on vpvr, they do hold very nicely as resistance or as support
it just shows you where the power is, where the amount of volume, where the amount of money is
okay, this was a very good shorting opportunity that we did claim, from a gartley pattern, from the resistance of an ascending channel
i did take, may maybe some of you did also take over the uh, take this shorting opportunity
but just to show you how these big mountains on the vpvr are very well respected, even though if you do get rejected or have a big, massive bounce, you can see it right over here, big, massive spike on the vpvr
well, this is actually from this volume trader, but if you do zoom at, zoom out
so now, of course, it is very likely, in my personal opinion, that bitcoin, if it does go down to round about that 12 000 range, it will be very likely gonna be close to the bottom
it is gonna be a level that's very much gonna be defended on bitcoin
if we do continue to the downside, i i will be looking for bitcoin to absolutely hit those levels, potentially in the next coming weeks
if it's not going to be in months, because we are losing one of the most important levels, the alltime high from 2017
we could actually defend it in the immediate short term, few days, couple of weeks
but it is a very, very likely that if we do lose this level, our next bit, next big, major level, is going to be the 12k guys
because the price action from from bitcoin going from 12 000, okay, all the way up here to 20 000, the price action was very, very fast
it just took a few weeks to have that insane momentum from 12k to 20 000
and back then, a move of 7 000 on bitcoin was a really big deal
okay? it was a big deal when bitcoin moved seven thousand dollars in just a few weeks
of course, bitcoin right now, moves seven thousand dollars in less than one week
we've actually fallen from 27 7 000 all the way down below 20 thousand dollars
but right now, you know, this is the kind of price action that bitcoin does
there will be a moment in the future, all right, you name it, 2024, 25 26, bitcoin will be moving ten thousand dollars, you know, in just one to two days
because, you know, the amount of money entering the market will be absolutely huge
i'm telling you right now, at 12 000 the moment, i have a huge amount of, well, huge amount for me, of usct and usdc, on the sidelines
and if bitcoin does reach twelve thousand dollars, it is going to be an absolute gift for me
you know, the reason why you do have dry powder on the sidelines, the reason why you do have, um, any stable coins, or dollars, or euros, whatever, on the sidelines ready for this kind of capitulation event? you know, things are coming to fruition right now, where you are seeing the collapse, you are seeing the fear, you are seeing potentially much lower levels
of course, i do have, you know, a quite large amount amount of usd and usdc on the sidelines, because, just in case we do hit that 12k level, this would be an absolute gift for me
and i will be, um, you know, i will be actually taking more than 50 of my, uh, stable coins and putting them in bitcoin, probably ethereum and some other all coins
of course, if bitcoin does collapse down to twelve thousand dollars, this is why it is absolutely insanely important to have those stable coins or euros or dollars or whatever on the sidelines, in my personal opinion, for this, you know, macro bearish, you know, recession, um, massive capitulation, basically to to i will be buying a huge amount of bitcoin
if we do reach twelve thousand dollars, of course, i am dollar cost averaging in right now at these levels
we can take a look at other markets and other cryptos, of course
but what i need you to do first it absolutely incredibly smash up that like button all the way to alltime high, as they say
so make sure to absolutely crush that like button here for the algorithm, and help me out here with the youtube channel
i got absolutely exterminated on my bitcoin long position, guys
it was, um, it was one of my only stop losses from the last couple of weeks
because we've, i mean, i've been absolutely doing some really good gains on bitcoin the last few weeks
of course, the trade that i did take a few days ago was stopped out with this massive drop, of course
but it's also true that i did see, you know, quite a lot of people being extremely bullish, right? the 20 000 range, the alltime high from 2017
okay, looking at this kind of reversal momentum, uh? and yeah, this is why, you know, this is why you have your stop losses, guy
uh, it was just a small percentage of the orca of my capital, so it's not too important
and if we go lower, and you do have some usdt, so in usdc, some stable coins, it is time to buy bitcoin, guys
monk labs, what's up, my crypto legends, you got that right, my man
we're at the similar way, we're, we're a little bit, we're at a similar point of breaking 6k in 2018
there's absolutely zero reason to call bottoms till price action proves it
this is total capitulation, guys, total capitulation that can be extended easily to, like you say here in the comment section, to 14k, or even 12k, right? 14k is a very interesting level
why is it such an interesting level? because if we go to the monthly chart, all right, back in 2017, the alltime high was wicked on the monthly, all the way here, just below 20 000
the major monthly close end open was here exactly at thirteen thousand eight hundred dollars
so a potential bounce from this 14k level, which is actually 138, is very, very possible
weekly dailies, we've been taking a look at dailies in the immediate, short term for those potential bouncers
and i'm going to explain how this major daily level has been broken
you know, you're breaking that level here solidly, early, early this morning, and you actually got rejected from this daily level
if i zoom out here, i want to show you what daily level this one is
this is currently acting as resistance because we broke it as support
big consolidation, big spike in volume, is actually getting broken right now
you get a small, small reaction, getting a wick, getting a consolidation
this 18 19, sorry, 4k levels, a major daily level from back in december
so let's go back here to the one hourly chart here one second
and i just want to make you understand that lower levels is very much possible
when you see a chart like this, it is total capitulation mode
this is absolutely insane hype, where the train, you know, is not going to stop anytime soon
and when you have this kind of dump action, it means that you know, dumping is not going to stop anytime soon
and we are just about to break one of the most important levels, which was the oldtime high from back of 2017
a major consolidation that we did have in december of 2020 is actually been retested and is very, very likely to be broken
not much volume here, he also traded back in december of 2020
when bitcoin reaches these levels, you can assume that the bottom is very close
guys, do you think that in the next coming months, bitcoin is actually going to consolidate here at twelve thousand dollars, ten thousand dollars, or even go lower and and go to zero? you're absolutely, incredibly wrong
it is very, very likely that you will be consolidating, having relief rallies here above 10 000, till the next big, massive cycle that will happen in the next coming years
guys, this is the absolute insane level that you need to start accumulating your bitcoin
okay? i understood this when i started investing in bitcoin back in 2018, that this, it has a huge, massive uptrend
and when we are going down, it is the moment that i'm going to start investing heavily
and this is what happened to me in 2018, 2019 and 2020, waiting for that big, massive hype on bitcoin that happened in 2021, in part of 2022, of course
so, you know, these next, you know, six to 24 months, all right
you know, it is going to be absolutely a lifetime opportunity, guys
and basically bitcoin is, is what, you know, is one of the assets there is going to be the people's money
the people that have more than one b one bitcoin are going to be, you know, they will, they're going to be all okay, in the next coming years, guys, it is very, very likely
and that is just, of course, my, you know, pure, um, personal opinion, uh
let me just, you know, make this a little bit of a, you know, educational content, as in, you know, what is going on, what is going to happen in the next coming years, um
i was not liquidated, but i was stopped out from my position yesterday
we've been doing, you know, i've been doing some some very cool trades
been totally transparent with my trades, with my analysis the last few weeks
um, you know, the best one, which was just about, you know, four days or four or five days ago, it was actually six days ago, on the 12th of june
this was the best shorting opportunity that we got in, okay, where we made absolutely insane gains
we were trading when we were, when i would when i did this video right over here
um, yeah, on the 12th of june, actually, this was on the 12th of june
if you are an old subscriber, well, you know that i, i was calling for this, um, big, major drop
if you are new subscriber from the channel, you can check the video, the live stream from the 12th of june, waiting for this exact level, for that big, major collapse, as we did
lose the biggest, major value area low from this trading position, from this, uh, from this volume traded for the last, you know, it was, you know, beginning of may till the first week of june, first second week of june
guys, we've lost the value area low from this huge consolidation
on the next retracement, it is time to absolutely go down to even retest the lows here
i took most of my profits here in a quick day trade around about the 277, and rode the rest all the way down here to the extreme low positions here at 25k and you can check that video on the 20, uh, sorry, on the 12th of may and the 13th of may
that was one of the best calls, uh, from june, actually, huge, huge gains and on
you know, the last few days, you know, i was trying to be smart, i was trying to be, i tried to be smart
it was just better, you know, really analysis, looking for that potential bigger relief rally, looking for that range trading after such a severe drop
but, you know, this is the thing, a bitcoin right now is in absolute capitulation mode
it is very, very likely right now that, you know, the twelve thousand dollar range, fourteen thousand dollar range, is only just a few thousand dollars away
okay? it's just probably going to happen, um, in the next coming weeks and months, guys
it, in my personal opinion, is going to be a lifetime opportunity
okay? it's just going to take a couple of years of accumulation, scary price action, recession
can we dip slightly below ten thousand dollars? yes, it is possible
but after that, guys, after big, massive fear, the pipe will be very real, real, and it will be even bigger than the one that we had in 2021
and you need to integrate this in your brain, because it is very likely to happen
and people will understand this in the next coming years, and we'll go to safer assets such as bitcoin
okay? once bitcoin reaches the market capitalization of gold, which is round about the 10 trillion dollars, gold can cannot be very manipulated, because it's got such a large market capitalization
once, once bitcoin gets to that market capitalization, there will be volatility, but it won't be as manipulated as it is today
we haven't seen these levels, you know, since september of 2019
we're currently below the extreme levels of, you know, march of 2020, which was at 8 10, 12, march of 2020, you know, kovitz c19, massive capitulation, massive feat in the market
and, you know, you know, you know the the the saying of warren buffett, you know, buy when there's blood in the market
be greedy when others are fearful, right? so let me just go through the comment section, guys
i just want to give you my personal opinion, because i, i do get some, i do get several messages from friends, family, you know, how you doing? are you good? and i'm doing absolutely phenomenal
i'm just saying, you know, it is time to absolutely, uh, buy all of these, uh, different you know, bitcoin basically, and and some other crypto assets
despite the massive fear, despite we're gonna go lower, i don't even care, because i'm dollar cost averaging
because if we do dip down below, you know, i'm already passing all of these stable coins onto exchanges, because i am ready for that major drop
and when we are in capitulation mode and we are going to lose a big, major support level, the drop to 12 14k
what do i mean with fast? i could me i mean a couple of weeks
we've just dropped from 27, 28k down to below 20 000 in less than one week
you know, we could follow easily another weekly or two weekly candles coming down to this level, guys
800 people watching the live stream, and we've only got 200 likes
if you are a new subscriber, if you're new to the channel, make sure to absolutely subscribe to the channel and smash up that like button right away
and if you are a trader, if experience or nonexperience, it doesn't really matter, because we're all going to have, you know, a great time
if i click on there, we are already 158 people joining the bibic competition
if you are joining my team, you can join the telegram group also
that will be extremely active from the 25th of june, which is two days before the competition
we'll be sharing charts, we'll be taking a look at, you know, we'll be doing insane scalping
so make sure to join the telegram group if you are joining the team
if you do not join the team and join the telegram you will be kicked out
this is only going to be for people for the trading competition
and we're going to absolutely be crushing these scalping opportunities on bitcoin ethereum and many other markets
anyway, let's, uh, why are you crying? yeah, only, this is for the thumbnail
i'm absolutely phenomenal, even though i've lost, you know, my portfolio is absolutely bleeding
portfolio is, yeah, it's almost at levels from back in 2018 and 2019, which is absolutely crazy
you know, let's just take a look at solana and solana, solana
what's a good analysis that we did do on solana um salon is very likely going to test, yeah, the 26 dollars
okay? we didn't test it on this early, this morning's drop, but it's, you know, very likely, especially if bitcoin is is going to start losing it
we do have solana losing this insane 35 range, coming up to retest the zone just three days ago, uh, three, two days ago, on the 16th of june, and got insanely rejected
we did say, you know, this does look like kind of a huge descending triangle
we had this descending triangle right over here that broke down, retested support
look at this, from descending triangle to a bigger descending triangle right over here
as you can see, look at this descending triangle inside of solana, right? you break the support, you retest the resistance and get rejected, right? technical analysis, just a bunch of lines on the chart, doesn't work? well, you know, you can see here it does
okay, where you do get these bounces at this support range, the 35 dollars
now what is very likely on solana to happen is that we are very, very likely going to retest these lows in the next coming days
could you get a small relief rally if bitcoin does of course, that could definitely happen
but the probabilities in retesting these lows are very, very high
so you know, some relief rallies will be good opportunities to short and continue the trend, basically
okay, a major level on solana here, looking at the daily chart, is this summer lows
let me just zoom in right there and and show you that this has been a very strong daily level
so if you do dip down below here on solana, you are very likely going to get a bounce
are you going to be ready to take that trade here? you've got a major low level, okay, being bounced here
if you do get that drop on solana, you know, this is the thing, price action
you know, we had this box leveled already just in case you did came back up here to potentially take that short
so if we do lose this low, we got a major daily level here at the 2346
it's a major level on solana where you're probably going to get a little bit of volatility, but you are very likely going to get that bounce
so if you do get that bounce, you know, you can range trade in between these levels
make sure to mark those levels, those daily levels, weekly levels, major support levels where you did get those bounces
and here is where you could take those potential trading opportunities
and if you are trying to to um to to fight the trend, right? trying to call the bottom, like i did just a few days ago with bitcoin, you know, yeah, bottom is not in
i got stopped out from, you know, potentially looking for that reversal move, right? but i did see quite a few people, the more people that see this, you know, the more, you know, the more i don't like it, because then, of course, most of the people were wrong
i'm retail also, and we do not want to think like retail at the end of the day
and this is something, you know, you know, the last couple of days, i was seeing so many people, too many people, saying, this is a bottom scenario
we're having an inverse head and shoulder, you know, this is the neckline
very likely, if we break the neckline, we're going to go higher
and, you know, then when you see this, i'm like, why is most of the people, you know, looking at what i'm looking you know, this is probably because i'm going to be wrong at the end of the day
this is why we do protect our positions, and this is why, you know, get stopped out
let you know, let's look, look at the next training opportunity
so let me just, um, scroll down here through the comment section, because every time i read a comment, i just talk and talk here through the chat
i haven't bought anything yet, but i'm getting close to says, stay humble, absolutely
i mean, these are already very interesting levels to start, you know, accumulating for the long term
if you want a longterm portfolio, if you, if you are an investor, we've got, you know, i'm a trader and i am an investor
and, you know, oh, as an investor, you know, my portfolio, i only took about 20 profits back here in may of 2021
okay, right over here, before the collapse, i only took 20 of profits in between bitcoin v chain um, ethereum
i am riding still, my chain link that i did buy from 2018, 2019
but, you know, from my 90 on my portfolio, i only took 20 profits, which was huge profits anyway
i did speculate on some all coins, and did, you know, okay, i did pretty good on some all coins
um, but i am riding, oh, i'm still holding 80 on my portfolio from 2018 2019
but this is the thing, you just never know when the exact top is going to be or the exact bottom
so this is why, for me, this is already, you know, accumulation zone for bitcoin and many altcoins
this is very, very similar to what happened here back in 2018, 2019
and i do strongly believe that the same kind of scenario is going to happen for the next 6, 12, 24 months
and this is the moment you need to be 100 interested in bitcoin and good cryptocurrency projects
i am already accumulating bitcoin for the last couple of months, you know, from that thirty thousand dollar range
you know, do we really know that we are going to go to twelve thousand dollars? this is the major question
let me ask this here to the community, right are we going? are we going to 12 k bitcoin? let me know guys in the comment section, because this is a super, super interesting question that i do really want to know
um, len, and i'm going to go quickly through the comment section right away
what is flow? i mean, we're going to try and avoid some altcoins
we actually at the lowest levels here from the launch on kraken exchange
there's nothing to analyze on this till we actually see floor levels
when are we going to see floor levels? the moment we go sideways for the next few months
it will probably slow down next month, by the end of the year, we do not know
i will be on unloading a huge amount of, you know, stable coins that i do have to start buying
do you know in the dump, they actually, you know, froze or the transaction
because i think it's about 70 or 80 people, percent of the people use binance
i absolutely hate finance, because then what they do is they freeze their, you know, their their exchange, you know, you cannot make any transactions on finance
um, so, yeah, they can go in and, yeah, i'm not going to swear, of course, don't sell
most of my chain link have been bought at one dollar, sixty cents
i wrote it all the way up to fifty three dollars, alltime high
um, still not in a loss, but almost, very close to my, you know, actual price that i didn't buy
if you are a new subscriber, this is something that you should know
of course, if you are following me, you want to know, what are your cryptos? what is your portfolio? what are you trading? so just something that i wanted to point out there, for new subscribers, what do you think about liquidation levels of microstrategy? is it 18k? i mean, this is pure speculation
also, there was an article of microstrategy saying that, you know, he can, they can come down as low as, you know, sub 4 thousand dollars, and they could even be still, okay
i've seen articles of, you know, microstrategy, you know, you know, michael sailor being absolutely okay, even though if bitcoin comes down to four thousand dollars, it would be absolutely fine
well, i, i, i do think that he's absolutely crap in his pants with this kind of prize action
uh, i don't know what is real um at the end of the day, because it was 21k, then it was 18k
he says that bitcoin could go down to four thousand dollars and it, it'll be absolutely fine
if bitcoin does go to four thousand dollars, this guy is in absolute big trouble, because he's invested a huge amount of micro strategies capital into bitcoin
uh, if bitcoin does go down to four or three thousand dollars, i think his average price entry is, uh, thirty thousand dollar levels, approximately
i mean, this is the thing, when there's a massive hype, i was already very cautious
you know, in 2021, when we were seeing all of these meme coins, when you were seeing the laser eyes all entire twitter
i had my brother, you know, i had, you know, a lot of friends investing in crypto
got into big liquidity pools um massive speculation with some altcoins, okay, such as cyto, metis dao
metis is a layer two solution for the ethereum network, which i do think it's gonna do very, very well
i bought metis dao at 45, okay, back in late 2021, and we arrived to about 320, and i sold 50, guys
you can actually check the youtube video back from then, and i'll tell you the exact date
i'll tell you the exact date if you can find my video on youtube on the it must have been about then, 20th of january, or 21st of january, or 19th round this range
saying, guys, i have sold 50 percent of my metis token that i did buy on an average price of 45, 46
i remember selling at market at around about 299, 300, when we were just having that volatility
you know, the reason why is because i did see this kind of divergence, i was seeing these kind of divergence, i didn't see this as a sustainable breakout
and, you know, this was very likely going to have that collapse because of the entire market sentiment
okay, i didn't, haven't done insanely best moves in crypto, but this was a huge one
i did buy at 26 cents, and i'm actually 50 down on my investment on saito, uh, because my average price was about 26 or 24, i can't remember exactly, and it's currently trading below one cent
it was over about, um, a 6x, because, uh, on my average price was 46, and sold at 300
so did a 3x in total of my initial investment on metis um and
but if you do the average, i'm, i'm in a, i'm still in a big win
you can check the video on youtube, because i'm totally transparent on my entries, on my exit
you know what i invest in you check that video from the 20th of january
you know, it must have been the 20th or the 21st, maybe a couple of one day after where i do say, guys, i sold 50 of my my medes, doubt
i still still believe in the in the project in the long run, but my average price is 26 cents
now, let me take a look at the poll, because we got 380 votes right now
are we going to 12k? bitcoin? is bitcoin going to 12k? we've got almost 400 votes
67 of people, most of the people, think that we are going down to twelve thousand dollars
because if i did a poll, if i did a poll back here in early 2021
and if i asked the same thing, but of course, inverted, if i asked in a poll, is bitcoin gonna go to 100 000? are we going? are we heading to 100 000? i'm telling you for a fact that, you know, about 70 of people would say yes
so say yes, because people go with, you know, that kind of trend reaction, right? you go with a trend reaction
but i'm telling you already, you know that these, these are levels to to to start buying, the same as these are levels to start selling
you know, this is why i sold 20 of my portfolio right over here at round about 59k
do you remember? i mean, if you are an old subscriber, we were also talking about this, why cough, distribution
once we lost this low, i sold 20 of my portfolio at this bounce, at this bounce, right over here
it was, i mean, i mean, i made a huge amount of videos already since then
but we were also, of course, talking about that, um, the wike of distribution, right? and this is the the reason why, you know, just in case, just in case, you know, i'm selling 20 of my bitcoin because of my portfolio, because there's meme coins coming out, this massive hype, you know, we have, we were having, dogecoin going absolutely crazy, shiba inu, a lot of meme coins, crypto gaming coins, um, yeah
we were talking about that distribution event, and also saying, guys, i'm out
this was a video from the 29th of april, you know, making that intro of that potential collapse down to 20 000
and, um, that was the reason why, i think, you know, the end of the bull run
but, yeah, just right at that, at that peak over here, is when i was saying, you know, what, what if? what if this distribution event was going to happen? so, yeah, definitely, you know, selling some of my portfolio, it was around about 20, just in case we had that collapse
and of course, after this relief rally, you know, it happened
we always updated on the possibilities of what could happen with bitcoin
make sure to be prepared to potentially enter one of the best opportunities in the next six to tw to 24 months, um, and expect it to be very, very, uh, long also, um, andy, can you please check matic, please? thanks
andy, could you please take a look at matic your stream? yeah, absolutely
and what two people already take, uh, saying to me, can you take a look at matic? absolutely
what happened on matic? if we do take a look at the three daily charts, we did manage to hold this alltime high level from march of 2021, which is exactly at round about the 53, 54 cents, just holding that range
this is a bearish pattern because you do have that selling pressure coming here on matic, as you can see, big, massive lower highs, trying to hold this range
what happens? you have an explosive breakout to the downside, as the demand doesn't, you know, equal the amount of selling pressure
basically, what is a good level here on on matic to potentially get a nice bounce
what range is that? this is exactly the 30 cents, 29, 30 cent level
okay, once we hit that 30 cent range, it is very, very likely to happen
if we take a look at vpvr levels, i want to see, you know, what kind of volume do we have at that range? i mean, we we have a higher volume here at the top, but what kind of volume do we have down here, looking at the vpvr? you know what? we do have some volume
let me see the price action here on matic back from march april of 2021
um value area low, you know, we are actually trading at the middle of the range of this trading zone
we do have, you know, on the daily some candles closing at this range, some volatility, some wicks actually getting about from this level
so if we are just trading at 35 cents, we haven't reached 30 cents level level yet, you could assume that we are very likely going to get some kind of reaction, some kind of small relief rally at this level, of course, we know, you know, it is risky to too long here
i'm longing because i have good risk management, you know, you know, if i get stopped out, stopped out on any longs, such as the one i did two days ago, it doesn't matter
it is absolutely, you know, totally fine, because the amount of money that i lose is very, very small
if you don't have risk management, of course, you're gonna long or, you know, and you have your liquidation price, you know, very far away
i won't be getting liquidated, you know, so many other people, you know
how much are you going to add? you're going to add in, add an ad till you get absolutely exterminated, you burn your account, or, you know, lose more than 50 of your capital
to get back into that trading wheel, you are gonna, you know, you it's gonna take a long time
this is why i do not risk more than three percent of my trading capital
i used to, and it was absolutely a waste of time and a waste of money
but it is good to to to learn, of course, at the end of the day
i mean, you know, matic, that's a good level where we could potentially bounce
what if, you know, what if we start getting a relief rally from this range? a good major level is exactly that 55, 56 range, where we do have the highs here, created from march of 2021
as you can see where we do have these support levels very, very much respected if the price action does have some kind of relief rally
does happen if we do have that relief rally? this is going to be insane level to potentially short matic
okay, we take a look at fibonacci retracement from this high to the lows
we're also looking, you know, all depending on where the lows are going to be, we are looking at that six, one, eight, six five, fifty, four
if we have a miracle, big relief rally, expect continuation to the downside
this is only going to be a good shorting opportunity on matic if it does pump to round about that 54, 55 cents
remember, on buyback, you do get the best bonus available on buy it
it is up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus, and you get 30 days of zero percent maker fee
okay? make a fee is free for 30 days if you sign up with a link in the description on buy a bit if you want that insane bonus
it is my favorite platform to trade different assets such as natural gas, oil, s p 500
this is an exchange that i am using to accumulate as much bitcoin as i can
you can deposit bitcoin and use bitcoin to trade oil, gold, natural gas, silver, forex
so if you are good in trading other markets such as forex, and you are interested in accumulating bitcoin for the long run, you can use bitcoin as collateral
you know, this is a good platform to accumulate more and more bitcoin
you know, i've got now unrealized profits right now that i will be taking profits by monday
i've got point 13 bitcoin here, over two thousand six hundred dollars in internet profit
i will be doing a transfer next week, very likely, you know, to my, you know, cold wallet where i accumulate my bitcoin
and this is the platform, and i'll be looking for other trades here
the good thing about primax bt is that you get seven percent added to your deposit, which is an insane bonus, guys
and i'm only saying this because this is a platform that i use, and i obviously get a small commission
but is it platform? if you're a new subscriber, you will be seeing this
use primex bt for different markets that i do talk about also on the live streams and videos
and buy bit for swing trading, of course, because the fees are extremely cheap
you can have a trade open for weeks and it will just cost you a few dollars
you know, you will be able to join on the next um, on the next trading competition
uh uh? guys? have we a little up before we fall harder? i mean, this is the thing, full capitulation mode right now
okay? but if we take a look at the 30 minute chart, i'm just going to tell you, what are the major resistance levels, guys
what is the biggest resistance level that bitcoin has right now? we can clearly see it here
okay? in between the twenty thousand and twenty thousand five hundred dollars
if bitcoin does get that relief rally, okay, over here, we are probably going to create a double bottom
i'm not sure about this, but if we do, if we do create a double bottom, let's check out the big major levels, guys, for trading
these are zones where you can take very much good opportunities and have insane gains
okay? the last five to six days value area low from this range will be huge resistance
you could arguably discuss taking the fib level from this high to the low
you're probably not even going to hit the 20 500 range, which is the biggest level on the vpvr
this zone is already a good shorting opportunity, especially when you have this huge amount of volume
if the price retraces that up here, guys, let's go with the trend like we we have been doing
the only reason i was slightly bullish at this level is because of this round formation, guys
it was only because of this round formation, this kind of descending weight scenario
and the reason why i placed a tight stop loss is just in case of this, just in case you do this, and just in case you continue down
just risk a small amount in your of your of your capital, because, you know, tomorrow's another day
no matter how much experience you do have in the market, every day as day one
and if you risk only a time of a tiny amount of your capital, you can trade all day long, every single day, for many, many years, and make good gains
because you only need a couple of good traders, a couple of good trades, to making huge gains
you know, the latest one before, the one from a couple of days was, you know, just less than one week ago, on the 12th of june
on the 12th of june, we were talking about the risk to reward from this trade where you had your stop loss above
because i entered this trade, and you can check on the video, guys
and i do explain it on the video on the 12th of june, live stream or video, i can't remember what it was, right over here, saying, guys, it is getting rejected from this big, major level
so this is why, if i would have got stopped out from this trade, but then we look for another trade and make more gains
but, you know, i can get stopped out five times, or even six from the amount of gains that i made from this trade just last week
so this is why, you know, you know, getting stopped out early this morning from the the the long trade that i did have
it doesn't matter because, you know, it's less than, you know, a fifth of the actual gains that i did make on this move to the downside
and this is the beauty of having good risk management and not even mattering if you are wrong with your analysis
we will all be millionaires, crypto millionaires, by 2025, 2026
constellation uses the same technology as phantom, which is not blockchain
air force, or something like that, was was looking at constellation dag technology to be used um
you can actually check this on articles and news here on on coin gecko
uh, in the next bull run, what happens with p l when you move your entry price down in future trades? do you have losses until you close your position? um, what happens with? um, profit and loss? when you, when you move your entry price down in future trades, do you have losses until you close your position? um, yes, you do
i mean, if your question is, when you add to your position, if you add to your position, okay, if i enter a trade right now, for example, at you know, say, yeah, if i, if i say, right, this is a double bottom
so my position entry lowers down, but price action goes down more
you are going to still be in a loss, if that is your question
um, when you move your entry price down in future trades, do you have losses until you close your position, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
if you, if you add up to your position, so your entry price goes lower, you will be in a loss, of course, until the price reverses
you can see it on many crypto influences for the last few days
i bet my ass that if you take a look at people saying, i am making the huge, biggest long position right now
and then if you check that, take a look at their videos, maybe looking at this inverse head and shoulder that we were talking about in the in my latest videos, also looking for higher levels
you know, we cannot, you can either wait for a retracement, uh, to enter a short, or maybe short now, because we are going to go lower
i could not show at the lowest levels, of course, it's just, it's not, uh, it goes against my, my, um, you know, my rules, of course
but, yeah, you know, a lot of the other influencers or, you know, traders, if you wish, saying, you know, i'm entering here a trade
you know, if we go to 17k, i will be adding to my position so i do not get liquidated
i'm gonna end, i'm gonna add to my position, so my liquidation price goes down, and my entry price goes down
guys, i'm putting my liquidation price down, adding to my position, so my entry goes down, and my liquidation price goes down
you know this, at some point you are, you know, from your initial entry, you are at such a huge loss that you're basically going to burn your account
you're basically going to lose your entire account, or over 50 percent of your account
i did get burnt out, you know, like this, you know, in the past
and i know it's not the smartest way to to to trade, you know, you're trying to find the bottom, if i'm wrong, finding the bottom, like from yesterday, you know, right? this was a daily level
you know, if i'm wrong, you know, calling this bottom from my average entry at the 227 k range, and i have my stop loss here below this 20k levels, up 199, 198
this is absolutely crazy stoplosses there are to save your butt
you know, all of these people that, you know, i'm adding more to my entry so my liquidation price goes down
whoever's adding to their position, yeah, good luck with that, because we might be going to 12k in the next coming weeks
you know, you do not need to take this as financial advice, of course
are we going to 12 k levels? are we going to 12k? bitcoin? guys, out of almost a thousand votes, we have 68 of people saying yes
let me remind you, if i would have done, and i'm a hundred percent sure, if i would have done a poll on if bitcoin is going to go to a hundred thousand dollars back here in april, back here in february, march of 2021, i bet my ass more than 70 would have said, yes, bitcoin's going to 300 000
i'm telling you, 70 of people would have said, yes, bitcoin is going to hundred thousand dollars
as soon as we start seeing these kind of spikes on bitcoin guys, at some moment, at some moment, we are going to be in a big accumulation zone
this kind of price action is what we want to see, but inverted
i mean, i'm not sure how can you invert this right now, like this
what if we do see this kind of price action in the next coming months? it is time, guys
i won't be afraid to do that once we see this kind of prize action
same as we, you know, uh, you know, same as the videos that we were taught, uh, you know, that was happening here in april
you know, that distribution event on wyckoff, this right over here, you know, we would take, i mean, this was pretty crazy
of course, a lot of people were talking about this back in april
and thanks to, you know, this kind of also wyckoff distribution and accumulation events, thanks to this kind of reading of the market where you do understand that the smart money is taking money out of these peaks
i have to say, i have said it, but i've been, you know, i've been talking about natural gas for the last, you know, two, three weeks, approximately
and, um, i gotta say it, my, i gotta say it, i did take the short
i must have been talking about natural gas for the last 20 days at least, saying, guys, this is this
but when i'm right, you know, where's that video? where's that natural gas video? where is it? looking for that distribution event or natural gas
everybody saying that natural gas is going to go higher, it's going to go to 15 because of the current european, eastern european situation
and i was saying, guys, you need to be bullish on natural gas down here, before the conflict, before everything happens
while it's happening, get bullish, not when we are entering the summer and natural gas demand goes down
i'm actually inside still with that trade on natural gas here on primix bt, with a few thousand dollar inner profit
i only get you said we were bottoming out and we were gonna have a because i did get some nasty comments, but it is what it is
wasn't it someone in the comment section, wasn't this a good call? i know, yes
let's take a look at algorand bro i think it's a crypto channel, then why? gas and oils? terror, absolutely the reason why it is a crypto channel
but, you know, it's, it's good to take a look at other markets as well
so it's, you know, it's a crypto exchange, but you can use crypto as collateral
and, by the way, gotta say it, because i do get a small commission
i got both full tutorials on primex bt and on by bit down below

so this is why we are currently holding this range? uh, very likely
says steve lego, uh, bro, can you take a look at al grant? yes, very true
it is sad to say, people want to have a good time, and i've got seb seb here
he must be home with his kids, with his family, and he can join the live stream
let's take a look at our grand i mean, this is something long term analysis on algorand something that we were eyeing
i mean, you get yourself, your cup of tea or your cup of coffee, because what what i'm about to say on our grand is something very, very powerful
but before you pay attention, make sure to scroll down, smash that like button
we are here to make the best trades, the best financial decisions for the next coming years
so anyway, al goran, something very powerful on our algorand i'm not sure you said check algorand short term, we are in a very aggressive downtrend
i i would, i could say, i could say, i do have the balls to say al goran is potentially very near the bottom
because we are maybe going to go to lower levels, especially if bitcoin drops down to 14 12k
but what i can tell you on our grand is something very, very special
if we go to the threeday chart, okay? is this big, massive abc correction going as low as the second wave
and if you have studied elliott wave theory, you can go in between first and second wave, okay? on an abc correction, it can be that aggressive that you can come as low as the first second wave
and this is what is currently happening on our ground, okay? and also also something very, very powerful
let me just take a look here one second, and just go with elliott wave theory
if you have studied the elliott wave theory, um, let me just go here, quickly through, right over here, you know, abc correction
and then al goran actually broke alltime high, of course, back in october november, making the fifth wave, and then having a very aggressive abc correction
we had the a coming all the way down here, as you can see on the chart
and the c correction can come as low as the first second wave
so remember, when there's fear and blurred in the market, you know, it is time to be greedy, guys
it's just as easy as going on and to algorand, you know, you might think to yourself, yeah, but tara luna also, you know, a lot of people were investing
but this is the thing, guys, there is a, you know, there's always risk in crypto
i do have some people that i do know that invested in tara luna, and they did lose quite a bit of money
and you can check the news, okay, on our ground, if you go on coingecko, there are a huge amount of of articles that you can read about our grand being a very good project for the future
you should be interested at these levels, not only because of this big, massive abc correction that's happened already on our grand trading at levels from 2020, okay? and also 2019, we have the biggest point of control here, the biggest accumulation level, right where smart money is investing
okay? and, um, yeah, this is basically what i could say for al gorant meet it
bitcoin is the king or the queen, whatever you want to name it
bitcoin goes lower, 99 of the old coins are gonna go lower too
bitcoin will lead you to find out where all coins could potentially go
if bitcoin does have the potential of going to 12k levels, the probabilities are very, very high at this range
we could consolidate at this range, at the alltime high from 2018, from 2017
and also the big consolidation from 2020, uh, december of 2020
but if we start breaking below the 19 000 range with daily candles, weekly candles, you know, it is, you know, very, very likely we are, we are coming down there, guys
we are going to come down to that 12k levels in the coming weeks
you know, this was april, just two months ago, we were trading at 48 000, guys
i am dollar cost averaging into bitcoin ethereum, and still adding to my usdt and usdc position
still adding stable coins, because we are going lower, and we are probably going to go even lower
but just in case, i am actually dollar cost averaging into bitcoin and ethereum
i'm having dollars on the sidelines for those incredible all coins, you know, such as chain link
i will be buying some unibrite, very strong believer on unibrite
so, um, i will be adding some other couple of cryptos that i do think that we are gonna, you know, have a good run in the next coming years
but anyway, we're not going to do, i'm not interested in the in the project
my average price entry on on chain link was 160, uh, you know, it went all the way to 50
but i did take profits on some other altcoins, such as v chain
i bought v chain at a fraction of a cent back in march of 2020
let me just go on vga, and i will tell you, vchain was my best investment
i only invested five hundred dollars on v chain and made, you know, of course, i didn't take all of the profits, but five hundred dollars
was turned into over twenty eight thousand dollars, because i bought, i bought v chain here at point zero, zero, 29 cents, i remember
and it reached, you know, it reached over, was it 20 cents? around about 25 cents
you know, that was almost almost 100, 100x, it was over a 50x um, made over, you know, i remember seeing my portfolio going crazy
did take some profits, you know, the profits that i took was way much than 500, of course
so, i mean, even though these pr all coins are garbage, and and a lot of them are gonna take a long time to recover, guys
and this is what i'm i'm trying to make people understand, we are gonna have, you know, all coins have a huge, massive sideways action, bearish momentum where most of the people are going to think that this project is dead, such as ada
ada is the biggest example, you know, the the the best example you could have
take a look at ada on binance, on binance, whatever, on on um, you know, on a chart from 2018
this was absolutely, you know, multiyear, 24, 36 months of absolutely boring price action with small relief rallies, sideways action
let me be, let me be clear here, but only a small percentage of the world population will manage to invest in, you know, these different projects
this is why it's good to have 10 cryptos, 15 cryptos in the bear market
you know, make it 10, make it 15, because you only need one or two that will absolutely, you know, make you huge gains
not even five percent of the world population have been using crypto and bitcoin
i i, i've seen videos, and you can, guys can search, you know, the dotcom bubble, you know, internet back in the early 90s, where you have, you know, these people, you know, going on television, and they're saying, you know, but what is the internet? what is internet? why do we need internet? what is the internet used for? you know, people doubting, you know, people actually doubting, saying, why do we need internet? you know, what is internet for? you know, people saying, you know, you can download newspaper, newspapers on the internet
and with the internet of, you know, the early 90s, it took about an hour to download, you know, a whole article on news
and people would just say, why am i going to wait an hour here, when i could just go down the road and buy it for 20 cents on in on the shop, right? uh
so this is why, this is very, very much similar to the sentiment, you know, crypto, d5, blockchain technology is an absolute total revolution, and we are at the very, very early stages, guys and you know, you know, you can be very wealthy
you can absolutely save your life if you're not well off, you know, with um, you know, with your your finance
and this is not financial advice, of course, what i'm saying, but, you you know, like like most of finance and investment and trading, 90 will fail
it is a fail they are failed projects, and a lot of them are going to be
i lost 90 of, uh, 90 percent of my money in shiva inu rakendra
this is very likely because you bought the top, very close to the top
if you survive this bear market, and and, you know, and accumulate some good projects, bitcoin, i'm only accumulating bitcoin in ethereum right now
i'm not touching one single altcoin, uh, despite the ones that i do have in my portfolio, because they're just there
and do like this, um, but i don't live from my portfolio, so it it doesn't matter
bitcoin cash absolutely lost it, because we actually broke this kind of ascending triangle situation
bitcoin cash is an og i mean, i think bitcoin cash will do good in the next run
i do follow some i think it's two youtubers that are um instead of bitcoin maxis
i used to hold a bit of bitcoin cash, but i, i just, uh, i did buy some, but i did sell on profit
i remember, back in 2020 or 2021, i did actually buy some bitcoin cash, um, but sold it and i sold it, uh, i in a profit and changed it for some other altcoins
we are trading at march 2020 lows, which is absolutely insane
the moment we start going sideways is, you know, very likely going to be a good moment to buy
i know, bitcoin cash is one of those cryptos that a lot of these, you know, payment solutions or applications or companies that accept crypto, they usually put bitcoin ethereum, of course, stable coins such as usd usdc, bitcoin cash also, and litecoin also
so, as being ogs, you know, they are having a bad time now, but i think, as they do have track record for many, many years, um, people, you know, track record gives trust
and, you know, litecoin is there, bitcoin cash is there, and they might gain a lot of trust, of course
uh, how can you not feel pain when your portfolio is getting destroyed? i mean, it is what it is
um in my portfolio is over, well over 60 percent down from its alltime highs
i'm very well much, uh, far off from, you know, two years ago, i was working as a welder
and with trading with um, with liquidity pools, trading, youtube, i mean, youtube doesn't hardly pay anything
you know, some affiliate marketing, you know, with links it does pay off something
but liquidity pools trading, i made insane gains, uh, trading back in april and also in may
you can check out, you know, the videos the last few weeks have, we've been doing some pretty cool trading calls, uh, except the one from before yesterday
you know, looking for that bottom scenario that didn't play out good
you imagine, if i would have, um, stayed inside of my position here, and, you know, stoploss was at 199, know what? 198 and 198, actually, stop loss was there
you imagine if i would have still been in that position and saying, i'm going to add to my position so my, you know, say, liquidation price was here or here, i probably would have got liquidated
you know, i'm going to add to my position so my entry goes lower, and i'm going to take my stop loss out, so my liquidation price goes lower
um, i'm actually going to transfer some of my usd, uh, usdt and usdc right away to an exchange to to buy up some bitcoin
i would do this live, but probably not, because you're going to see my password
and i don't want you to do that, because you're going to steal my bitcoin
but i am today, uh, going to pass some bitcoin, some stable coins, to my exchange, and i will show it tomorrow
i don't need to show it, but i will you know that i'm going to buy some bitcoin today
can we go why don't you wait for 12k? because i don't know if 12k is coming
but don't worry, i'll be having some stable coins on the sidelines to buy up here at 12k
i'm not gonna all in here by but i'm probably going to use five percent of my stable coins today when i end the live stream, and i can show you tomorrow, to buy some bitcoin
why are you gonna add why are you gonna buy bitcoin here if you are saying that we're going to 12k? because i really don't know if we're going to go to 12k
dollar cost, average is the strategy that i used entire 2018, 19 and 2020 the same thing
i'm going to do for the next 6, 24, 36 months, whatever you name it
over 1 350 votes right now, are we going to 12k bitcoin? 68 of people are saying yes
oh, i just spent 60 dollars on a ledger nano, but i haven't got any crypto to put in it, or i will send you
make sure to join the telegram group down below, because he's absolutely insane
i'm not that much active, but you can tag me there, and i will be answering some questions sometimes
if you have got a ledger, i will be sending you some some crypto
then two years ago, i've actually got to have a picture here, and i do want to show you guys
um, i'm going to show you right away, actually, i'm going to show you right away
i've got a, you know, i'm going to show you right away, right away
i can't show you now, but i'm gonna, i'm gonna send the picture, and i'm gonna share a a picture of me working as a welder
uh, you know, doing nine hours, ten hours, working saturdays um, uh, yeah
this is, you know, and it my life just turned around, uh, last year, just over over a year ago
and i just want to make understand a lot of people that are, you know, tired of, um, of work, and tired of, you know, not thinking that they can't reach financial freedom, and they cannot, you know, improve with their finance
we are going to be in very hard times, and, um, but we are going to be here to grow together, no doubt about that
we are going to be here to grow together, and we're going to absolutely crush it with trading
i'm going to create a discord so we can do active trading and make huge gains all together
and we are going to enter a lifetime opportunity in the next months
and you guys, if you stick around, if you know to dollar cost average
you will be, um, very much, you know, rewarded in the next coming years
there are gonna be a huge amount of people worldwide interested in buying bitcoin at these levels
it's very likely, if the longer we are here at this range, even better, guys, you have the opportunity to at least accumulate, point one, one bitcoin
you know, can you manage to accumulate one bitcoin? i remember my first bitcoin here, when i accumulated my first bitcoin, which was in 2019, before this major runup, i was very, very happy
thanks to this dip over here, i managed to accumulate one bitcoin
and once you have that one bitcoin, you're like, wow, i made it
what happens next? go for your second bitcoin, and it just, you know, it never ends
and never ends once you have several bitcoin and you have this kind of runup
maybe not money, but maybe if you accumulate, point one bitcoin, point two bitcoin, point five, one bitcoin
try and accumulate one bitcoin, maybe even, you know, even ten thousand dollar for one bitcoin
from some for some it is, you know, if you manage to to to to grab a few bitcoin, you will be set off in the next coming years
this these kind of comments, won't, you know, makes me want to to continue with this guys
because, you know, march, april may were insane trading weeks
you know, the only stop loss that i had in june was the early, you know, this morning's one, this morning stop loss on bitcoin
trades are doing great on primax bt, trading oil, natural gas
this is going to go directly to my cold wallet next week to add up to my um, bitcoin position for the long term
well, make sure to follow the channel, because we are going to absolutely be doing ins intensive technical analysis on bitcoin, on some old coins, but focusing on bitcoin
we might be taking a look at s p 500, but i focus on bitcoin mainly
um, and if you are, you know, obviously you not, but if you are experienced guys in trading
for the rest of the people, make sure to join the bybet competition
from the 25th, i'm going to be extremely active on the bibit world series of trading telegram group
we're going to be absolutely analyzing the situation, looking for the best entries
are we going to go to 12 000 bitcoin? we got 69 percent of people saying yes
i the two platforms that i'm only using at this moment, there are a lot of good platforms
there's bi there's bitget the both are the ones that i use the most
the only ones that i am using at their current moment is primix bt, and it is also by bit
my favorite is buybit, because buybit has a huge amount of liquidity
they got, you know, uh, they got gold, oil, natural gas, your s p 500, dow jones
and the sweet thing about primex bt is that you can use crypto as collateral, and no kyc needed
yeah, yeah, i'm not gonna, you know, i'm not gonna further it down because i might get into trouble
but, yeah, basically, these gains go, they go straight into the wallet
anyway, prime mix bt my favorite platform, okay, to trade other markets
you deposit ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred dollars on top of your account
if you deposit a hundred thousand dollars, you're getting seven thousand dollars on top of your account to add as buying power
i mean, these are, this is, you know, the only reason why i am recommending these platforms, okay, is because i use them, number one, and also because i do get a small commission
if you use my affiliate link, i get a commission, but you get the best bonus available
kda, there's not much to add, i think, on this, on this um chart, we're absolutely collapsing on cadena
are we entering huge accumulation levels? i mean, this is the thing, this, we are probably entering good accumulation levels on cadena
we could probably go as low, i think we mentioned this on another live stream, down to the one dollar range
um, i'll tell you what, caden is very likely going to lose this low
we are retesting this major support level for the we are very likely going to retest it for the third time
i mean, this one had a very good shorting opportunity just a few days ago
but looking for, you know, this lower high trend line right over here, this major level, very likely gonna get rejected here
got a beautiful rejection here on cadena, exactly at the 188, the lower part from this box, still aggressively creating these lower highs, retesting this level
you know, using a 10x leverage, which is relatively high for, uh, for an altcoin
in my opinion, i usually use four or five percent on all coins
but, you know, that's a 150 move if you're using a 10x leverage
and cadence can be traded on by bit i do remember, see, i actually did trade cadena, um, not a few weeks ago, a few months ago
you know, a lot of people here holding on there on the live stream
i know i now need 500 usdt minimum to enter, but i will, all gains go to my account during competition if i trade
uh, tony07, thank you very much for for joining the live stream
how does the competition work? well, your main question here, when i enter the competition, all games go to my account
you trade from 500, you make a hundred dollar gain on a trade, of course, it will be adding to your 500 account
this competition is only to see who is a good trader, who has the best performing, you know, trades, who has the biggest percentage, who has doubled their account or tripled their account in 20 days
who's going to be the best leader? all right, i might be winning as the best leader or the worst leader
but you know, who's going to be the best leader? who's going to be the the group with biggest percentage gains, who has had the biggest percentage gain trade
also, you know, there might be someone, there might be some lunatic, you know, they are usually chinese, uh, that, um, have these trades that have, i don't know, 20 000, uh, profit trade from an altcoin with a hundred x leverage
i, um, you know, it all depends, all the prices are different, all depending on, um, so, yeah, it all depends
you know, who has had the best percentage, who has made the best gains, who has doubled their account, who has been the best leader, who, you know, your gains are yours? uh, uh, right
i did a bitcoin giveaway, uh, about two months ago, trying to get people to smash up the like button, but it was complete fail people don't just smack people
i don't short at the very, very low i mean, could you short because we're going to go to lower levels? it's all up to you
i've moved accidentally because i don't know what's happened here
yeah, i'm not shorting bitcoin because bitcoin is at very low levels
can we still collapse from this range? yeah, we are in absolute capitulation mode, guys
so if bitcoin were to have some type of recovery, what we do know? you know, just imagine that we go up to twenty thousand five hundred dollars in the next couple of days
and don't say it is impossible because we were only trading there yesterday
so if we do retrace that, this is the moment you want to get into that high probable shorting opportunity
so, yeah, i mean, this is the thing, can you short from this level? yeah, you can
but it's a very risky trade because there might be a huge short squeeze at some moment
andy, do you think solana will get below that 26 low, as it's not moved much at all, even with bitcoin dumping? um, yeah, probably, yes
i think solana can go to the summer 2021 lows, which is around about the 20 22 i think we could get some kind of a bounce around that range
let's take a look at the rsi are we creating bullish divergence? i bet my ass we are
we are we actually creating bullish divergence on the one hourly? does this mean we're gonna have a reversal? no, but it just it does mean that, potentially, that the bearish momentum is getting exhausted
let me just take a look at the rsi here, one of my worst indicators that i like to take a look at
you know, we are slightly creating higher lows on the hourly rsi, slightly higher lows, lower lows
these are so attractive levels for bitcoin, i'm gonna at least put five percent of my stable coins into bitcoin today
hey, a long time since i haven't seen a lot, uh, some people, we are starting to get those people
i remember a lot of people saying that bitcoin will go to zero back in 2018, 2019
bitcoin has, uh, you know, over a 12year, 13year, you know, track record
only exchanges and only scams, which people, you know, a lot of is a lot of the news doesn't make it clear bitcoin, blockchain hasn't been hacked
no double payments has ever happened on bitcoin blockchain network
is that that, that, that that, um, a good major level on ethereum
let me just mark it here, because it's a potential level where we are going to get a bounce
and why do i mark this in these levels? well, i'm going to explain you
we got another bounce here from this daily level, kind of a rejection
broke down, got a bounce from the daily rejected from this daily huge consolidation on a daily level
and if ethereum does, i mean, if we do retrace back up here, it is very likely going to get rejected
you are very, very likely on ethereum, if it comes back to retest the 1005, 1050, it's a huge daily level, we are going to be looking at the six one eight fifty percent fibonacci retracement from the start of the drop
if we do stop here, six one eight is exactly at the one thousand forty dollars
if we were to stop here, of course, if we go lower, we could see, you know, the fibonacci retracement level
um, it is very likely going to have, uh, it's going to be a good shorting opportunity the 1050 range
if we start seeing that reaction, if we start seeing this kind of price action on ethereum right over here, we do get that this kind of price action, those kind of bars, once with the price action does pump to this level, the resistance range like this, you will probably get that collapse to come back down
if you fight the trend, you will get burnt, like i did yesterday
and major consolidation level that we did have from um from december of 2020
we're over a week of consolidation before breaking the old town high
if we are closing below 20 000, it's going to be looking very bad
they are my favorite trading platforms that i use on a weekly basis
check out the bitcoin sensors website if you want the latest news and technical analysis ideas
we've got the latest crypto news articles here regard, you know, regardless of the the bear market, crypto is still running
you know, even though prices are going down, prices are going down because of the general market sentiment
but crypto will be back, and it will be back stronger than ever in the next coming years
we're just gonna give everyone the content to our beautiful community, first of all
i did expect um might take profit to get hit, at least maybe beginning of next week or something
but this morning, when i did analyze the charts for twitter, for bitcoin census, um, you know, afterwards, when i was just looking at the choices, wow, market just had already hit
hello, harris, how are you? mohammed, how are you? the garden? mark reborn, hi nat
how are you? steven? uh ayodele, how are you? dj, hello alessandro
well, oh, the mark can be is it better now? is it better? maybe we can do this and that
how did you know it was supposed to go under 20k? sammy, well, i don't know, i just knew, you know
well, why i knew this was because, look at the candles like you you have this huge drop
i just, uh, guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so we can, you can help me with the algorithm to reach out to more people, so we can grow this channel
you see how much you learn through me, and i want so many more people to do that
just gonna say this, you can receive a bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars on vibe
it's up two for four thousand fifty dollars, by using the link in the description down below the video
and between census, i did have my take profit at ninety thousand and forty, might say
i did, i didn't either expect the market to drop this much either, right? and from nowhere, you just saw the drop
um, coin telegraph, we just, we can go in and see if we see anything
um, on coin telegraph, what actually happened? um, if like, let's see something on bitcoin an hour ago
a brutal day of losses unfolds as bitcoin crosses under its previous cycle high for the first time in history
but because you've been following me, we already knew the market was supposed to come to 1940
if you go to my youtube channel, you can see a couple of days ago, i was talking about the next level, 19 040
so we already knew the market was supposed to come to this level
so if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, you should do that right now
but why? data from sighting first december region as nerf's heightened after united says federal reserve comments on the inflation outlook
crypto market bore the bounds of selloff, which began after shock
bitcoin also achieved a lifetime first, dropping below its previous half cycle high for the first time in history
this begins reserved for a coins, uh, which has also now slipped below mark for the first time since reach income
we can use the the seven percent losses for the first two weeks of the months making june 2013, 22, the worst month of june on record, according to data from unchained
is above average for the first time this week, but much more in need for okay, well, a huge drop huge drop
but we did expect the market to do this because of the 90 point level
i essex even know how to, um, to say that, but, um, love for pakistan
it's the first time that i feel s i feel super when the market goes down
next level for us to pull back down to, that is the next key level that i look at, and that is 17 040
um, what were you doing before bitcoin and crypto? i was back testing the market so much while i had, uh, i think i had how many jobs? i've always been very hard working, so i had like two, two to three jobs at one time, and i was a flight attendant
uh, okay, but what now, perfectly we came back down to 19 040
i don't, don't worry about this, because the market needs to drop
and obviously, it's a lot of things that um is is affecting the market
and, um, it still works, right? but it's definitely something that i study at the moment to become a better, um, fundamental analyst, too
but it takes some time, you know, to learn new things and how to combine it with the with the technical but it's definitely something that i think it's important
and for myself, it's just also good to come to just add up other things
that makes your confirmations better, right? because it's actually the fundamentals that moves the market
so, yeah, but i'm not gonna say, i, i'm actually not the best one when it comes to fundamentals
okay, so looking at bitcoin now, it's pretty hard now because, uh, the market
sorry, i'm just going back and forth now i'm so, i'm so happy today
have we spoke about this previous highly low around twenty thousand five hundred and seventy five
and we saw the drop during the live stream, but we saw the market pull back up
but if we had, you know, we usually have the stop loss above the high, either this high that we did have from june at 17, or this previous high right here at 20 and 800
so when it comes to stop losses, i have pretty, i can have sometimes pretty big stop losses on on cryptos, because you can see, obviously, the market is very volatile
and if we had the stock, i did not take this trade because i was already in position
um, but this, usually we take our stop loss a couple of pips above the previous high
you can see how the market just came up and gave us the fake out, and then you saw this huge drop
um, so i, i didn't take it, but i think a lot if you took it from here
a lot of people would have their stop losses around this week
so they would probably be taking out right if you didn't have your stoploss above this high that we had since also 70s of june, but just in a different time
and then now we saw this huge drop and came back down to 19 040
um, i wouldn't expect the market to pull back up super, super oh, my god
um, i i wouldn't expect a super huge movement to the upside at the moment
if you know me by now, you want, you know that i want to throw this out of the window and just scream
so, looking, we can't what we can do right now to see a pullback we're taking the fibonacci from 19562 back down to the low at 18 9508
i, first of all, i don't expect the market to give me such a huge moment to the upside
so i'm looking at, i am looking at two hundred 19 sixty eight and nineteen thousand three hundred and thirty eight
we should all like and praise alpha queen nat and call her the new central bank
unless you put one, one one, if you took some trades off from me this week
if you took trades from me this week, even though i'm no financial advisor, please write one, one, one
so many people told me that they are in some really good profits
remember, i am no financial advisor, but i'm so happy that i can help you guys
remember to, even if you decide to take my trades, always trade with risk management
because, you know, i can obviously also be wrong, and sometimes i am that
so i know we get so hyped when we take the trades and we're in profits but then next time you're like, oh yeah, this is going to go so great
you lose more money of the account because we chose to go with with too much leverage, or too much of a lot size
um, seems like people using crypto as saving turn spending as to why the market is fumbling
biden says bitcoin will go to zero, that and then that, and the vanish
and never listen to the government, right? never listen to the government
but you know, is it worth longing b2c from here? i actually, i actually do not know how far we can come back down to um, if we continue, if we would see that the market, uh, uh
that is the next key level that i see we can pull back down to if you continue to see this drop, obviously, but it's pretty hard
you should think about that you have money, even if you don't have it
uh, same thing when we're looking at ethereum, uh, same thing when we're looking at ethereum, uh
no, i know the market is just dropping and we obviously try to see where the market will find the support
we're waiting for the market to find a support looking at ethereum, if we go back in time, it's easier for us to look at the highest time frames, right? um, yeah
you know what? it's pretty hard to tell you exactly where the market will find the support when we have this huge, huge candlestick
um, if we would see not you speak and and think things, seem to experience
think only of your peace, love and health, balance in your amounts, no bad juju, exactly
so if we just go back in time, if we would see, in the in the near future, that the market is start to pull back up, slowly and steady, we always use previous support and resistance zones
and, um, going back on the two weekly charts, we can see more clear that, uh, 1 330
if we would see that the market is um pulling back up, and we're closing above this level
that can definitely, slowly, instead be the market continuing up, right? but it is
i mean, it's not something that we will use at the moment, because the market is all, you know, coming back down to nineteen, nine hundred and thirty dollars on ethereum
next key level to drop back down to is, uh, seven hundred and thirty dollars
so we go down to the lower time frames now, because on the higher time frames, we only see, or at least how i do it, we only look at the direction, or what level we can come to
on the lower time frames, this is where we use the previous support and resistance zones and people notching
so we broke the level, uh, also the previous support at one thousand and twenty five dollars, and one thousand and thirty dollars
if we would see bigger momentum, we can try to take your fibonacci from one thousand and seven to eight dollars, back up to 988 dollars, if we would see the market pull back up
now, because the market did create a lower low, right? and what do we okay, so one question
what do we do at the lower low? i want to ask you that question
what do we do around the lower low and what do we do at the lower high? what's the difference with the lower low and lower high? i'm waiting, i'm waiting for you guys
i want you to tell me, because this is the most important thing, the difference between a lower high and a lower low
where do we sell the market from in a downtrend? do we sell the market from the lower low? or do we sell it from the lower high? wait and retest as a buyer
so if you want, if you buy from the lower low, do you know how far the the pullback will be? you don't you trade against the trend
but usually, if you buy, if you buy the market from the lower low
so that is the, sorry to say it, that is this stupidest thing that you can do, and especially if you are a beginner, is to buy the market from the lower low, lower law
i mean, you can do that, but if you lose money, you know why? because you're trading against the trend, if the market is dropping
okay? so say, for example, now, i i wait for the market to potentially pull back up to 1030 or 10 045
this is where i could potentially wait for the market to drop, right? but i don't know if the market will come up to these levels, because on the lower time frames we have different levels, right? we can also take fibonacci from this high to this long
and if you're like, oh yeah, not natalie says the market will pull back up to these higher time frames, fibonacci levels, but then the market only come to 1004
and you've bought the market because you think the market will pull back up to this level
and especially when the market goes back down, market drops from here, you're like, yeah, but natalie said the market were supposed to pull back up to this level at 1030
i expect the market to potentially come up to that level if we see a bigger pullback
don't you have, if you don't have the patient, to wait for a couple of hours for the market to either to come back up to this level? do you really have to buy the market? do you really need to do that? can't you just take some time off the charts, let the market do what it's supposed to do, and when the market comes to your levels, then you but you sell the market, because the profit from the lower high to the next lower low is always bigger than the pullback the i speak for the people with no experiences, because usually this is what happens
you just go in and buy the market just because you see the market drop, and now you think the market will have the biggest, you know, movements to the upside
you only see a small pullback to this level, on the lower high, because after this huge drop, usually the market is not giving you the biggest pullback
and now you sit in draw down, and you're getting in panic, because most of the time people over leverage
you know, you lose the the amount of money you you all you had now in profit
and now you're stuck in your own brain, and you're like, why did i do this? and now you just feel bad, and now you angry
so don't, don't if you're not experienced, if you do not know what you're doing
i cannot tell an experienced trader what to do, because they already know what to do, right? experience is the best thing
okay, so the next level we could potentially see ethereum now, uh, pull back up to um is one thousand dollars, and one thousand and five, one thousand and four dollars
and if we, if this fibonacci now, we're coming back up to this level, if we see the continuation of the drop, i don't know if the market will just, you know, go sideways
we had the big drop, and i'm not sure if it's going to continue to drop
but if that is the case, on this little pullback that we have, take profit one will be 906 dollars
take profit 2 will be 960, and take profit three will be in 930 dollars, because that is the next key level
but if we see a bigger pullback to the upside, if we break this one, because right now we are retesting, uh, 102 fibonacci level, if we see the market have bigger momentum, we're looking at where i look at one, at 1025 and 1033
guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, we have 250 people on this live stream
come on, help me to grow the channel so we can reach out to more people
and look at the hello dobies, how are ya? yeah, we're just going to wait and see
if we would see a bigger pullback, would drag fibonacci from 2444 on bitcoin back down to 1008, 18973
so we take these ones away, and we're waiting for the market to pull back up to potentially 1913
because what what we do right now is that we wait for the market to create the next lower high, because the market is obviously dropping
these are the levels that i look for the market to pull back up to right now
um, but i still, because we do have a pretty huge candlestick at the moment
so i want to see how the close of that candlestick, and potentially how the 15 minutes charles does look at five minutes chapters look like
what else do you want me to look at, guys? uh, i saw that we had some people, uh, we had some people wanted me to look at some other coins
did anyone buy in the market? because obviously we see see different things
so did anyone buy the market? i mean, if you did buy the market and you weren't, stoploss
this is what we need to understand, is that the, uh, the losses is our biggest and best lessons, because you can go back and see what actually happened and what you can do better next time
so never, never feel sorry just because you were in in stop loss, right? it's just part of the game
now, crypto, so we're just gonna do the same thing, because everything looked the same
we dragged fibonacci from the high at 212 back down to the low at 199
and this is also if we, if we see the market break through this level, we can also pull back up and retest 209 dollars
certainly, i'm running and laughing for the first great school question
are you drunk, tomasu? what are you eating? okay, so i'm being beat
the pullback can come back up to 205 dollars, potentially 207 dollars and 209
take profit to 189 dollars, and take profit three, 183 dollars
guys, if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, you should go inside and do that right now
i got introduced to trading at 2018, and from that, i've been hooked
but i guess you can see that on my energy and the way i talk about trading? trading is like my baby
trading is the best thing i've ever chosen to do in my whole life, because it opened up so many doors, not just within myself, but just, you know, have the people around me that i have
and you guys, it's amazing what, what? what? it actually can change your life
so that is why you should follow my channel, because i'm very good when it comes to the technicals
you can clearly see that we have this huge, a huge, huge drop right here on xhc
so what i did was that i took a fibonacci from 4043 back down to twenty seven point five dollars
the fibonacci is at thirty four dollars and thirty five point forty five
and slowly steady, if we start to see that the market is breaking the uptrend, because on the lower time frames, you'll see that it is an option the drop
the first take profit, if this is the case, will be twenty four dollars
take crap in one, take profit two is eighteen dollars, and take profit three is twelve point thirty six dollars
but, uh, so this is if, if we see that the market pull back up to these levels, it can definitely happen
um, but if we would see a break, uh, if we would see that the market breaks below potentially 31 with huge momentum, and then see rita's from below, this just might be the drop back down to to the levels, right? because we're trying to break a previous resistance, also, a previous report
you can see that we tried to break this level before, but you saw the fake out
um, if you don't, you know, push back even more to the upside
we can look at matic magic usd okay, so magic did the exact same thing
can you see what a beauty this is? so market pulled back up and retested the fibonacci levels at zero point four hundred and zero point four hundred and five dollars
take profit two was at zero point and at three hundred and fifty eight
and take profit three zero point three hundred and four forty two
so we're just gonna take this one away, and we're gonna take another fibonacci
if that is the case, and we see the market create the lower high against this level
when you can see that we're also pulled back up to retest a previous support, we can also come back up to zero point three hundred and eighty five
take profit one will be zero point three hundred and fifty eight
i'm just gonna go, i'm just going to continue to do our xrp usdt, guys
i just want to show you, um, i just want to go through this quickly so you, you everyone can get to see their coins
oh, yeah, but this isn't, uh, we never came back up and retested this fibonacci
we're coming back down to rita's this low right here at zero point two thousand seven hundred and seventy four
so if we only have a small pullback at the moment, we can come back up on xrp and retest zero point three thousand one hundred and twenty zero point three thousand one hundred and forty if this is the pullback, or this is the lower high, and we see the continuation of slowly and steady to the drop
uh, take profit one is zero point two thousand two hundred and ninety four
take profit three is zero point two thousand nine hundred and five
and take profit three is zero point two thousand eight hundred and twenty six
i'm just going through everything that you want me to look at
would you say that fib is the responsible for your trading success? no, i am the responsibility of my trading success
so we we're looking at aave, uh, where we could potentially see the market pull back up to fifty three point seven dollars
uh, fifty four point three dollars, if we see the market pull back, oh, we can also, okay, so if we would see the market having a little bit bigger movements to the upside, we can also look at 557, because that is the previous support that we did break
but the take profit on this, uh, baby is, uh, take profit one is 14, uh, it's 498
i was actually in the trade a couple of days ago in chain link
and i was like, this is the first time i traded link and my stoploss got hit because we had this huge fake out to the upside
i think it was this one market just pulled back up, and then it dropped
i was so proud of myself, like, this is the first time i trade chain link and my stuff last got hit in front of my eyes
what platform? what are you talking about? watering you what platform? um, okay, so looking at chain link now
so we broke the support at six point twenty dollars, go down to the one hourly chart
um, so either we take the fibonacci from this high at six point forty dollars, back down to the support at 57
everyone knows about karen, right? and he just goes and he just goes to everyone and she's like, how are ya? so, now, that's why i say it, it's just, you know, i just like the way you say it
how are ya? okay? on chain link, uh, six point eight dollars and six point fifteen dollars is a level we can pull back up and retest
if that is the case, and we see the continuation of the job, i know is i know, i know
take profit two is 530 and say, profit oh, that was to profit, you guys
if we see the continuation, if we see, you know, this is the thing, right? the mark, if the market have big momentum to the upside and, you know, break above it, this fibonacci will not be valid, right? so we always have to have in mind that when the market pulls back up to these fibonacci levels, we need to see that the market is actually especially on the lower time frames, because usually when the market has been dropping this much, as it does right now, the market just gave you a quick pullback, right? a quick pullback
so on the lower time frames, you'll see on the 15 minutes chart how the market starts to um retest this level, and then you just see the market drop
so just because i give you certain levels, that does not mean that it will respect it
don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on five bits, up to four thousand and fifty dollars
and the great thing with with buybit is that when we hold our positions for a longer time, it's a very low fees
and it's actually really good because you can do, you do everything on by bit
when you take your stop loss, your your take profit, you see exactly how much you are about to risk
and you are, you know exactly how much you are about to to gain also
i i actually thought that, uh, by bit was a little bit complicated before, because i didn't, i didn't trade it
um, but this is, you know when you, when you use the, you just see everything when you put the stop loss or buy with tp sltvsl is great
but we can check it from 1594, first of all, because that is the closest one we and 1495 is the low
we can pull back up now to forty three, 1543, or fifteen points, uh, fifty four dollars
if we drag it back up, you'll see that the fifty percent is around this
or we can come back up to fifteen point fifty eight dollars, or fifteen point seventy two dollars
and that is also combined with this preview support that we did break
if that is the case, and we start to see that the market, and ask the same thing on the other ones
now i go through everything very quickly now, because everything looks the same
my my neighbors must have been so annoyed about me, because i started to play music very, very early in the morning
we we take um the fibonacci from 04865 back down to zero point four thousand and seventy
what time is it there, natalie? it's one o'clock in the morning now
okay, so looking at cardona now, can you see how perfectly the market is now retesting the level? if we would see the market continue to drop from here, take profit one would be zero point four thousand five hundred and five
take profit two will be four thousand, three hundred and fifty
take profit three will be zero point four thousand two hundred, two hundred and fourteen
i wanna see how bitcoin and ethereum looks right now, because i just might also see
uh, you know what? i would actually still wait for the market
been waiting on the sunset, but i think i need that, but i can't do it like that
we can pull back up to 3040 to i would actually wait, because you can definitely see the market feel this week
um, but if we also drag it, uh, i mean, it's pretty hard when the market is just giving you one huge pullback to the upside
okay, so if the fine, looking at the five minute chart, if we break below 2938, what happened there? and we see rita's from below, and we and we retest it
we can see the continuation of the drop from take profit one, if that is the case, is 28, uh
take profit two is 275, and take profit three is 26 dollars when it comes to solana
but you can also obviously see the market pull back up now to 302 dollars and potentially 3042
um, so yeah, if that is the case, take profit one will be 2764 dollars instead
and twenty, uh, take profit three, twenty four point fifty four dollars
okay, what? we can look at weights then, and then you can correct me if i'm wrong
um, natalie, in the fibonacci, always from the body, or sometimes from the wig
um, i take it, i do different things, but i usually take it from the body
some people say you need to take it from the wake, and some people say to the body
i say, go back, test it yourself, and you'll see what you feel more comfortable with, i feel more comfortable with, uh, the bodies, because that's just, you know, when you back test it, you see the pattern, you see how the market moves
and sometimes i use it, and sometimes i even use it from body to weak everything depends on so when i look at the charts, and especially while the market is around the fibonacci levels, i look at how the market is behaving around these levels
so i just play around with my, with my fibonacci and see, okay, this is where the market is actually retesting
but usually from body to body, i would say, especially on the higher time frames, on the four hourly, i always take it from, uh, from the body to body
but when it comes to one hourly and down to lower time frames, i play around with the fibonacci a little bit more
and 468 if this is the case, take profit one four point thirty three dollars
take profit to four point zero nine dollars, and take profit three of three points and ninety dollars
i'm just gonna see the higher time frames perspective a little bit
you know, yeah, how much minimal capital do you need to start trading? it depends on how much money you are willing to lose
i'm only here to share my, my own thoughts about trading, nothing more than that
so if you, if you decide to take my trades that i show you, that is not on me or on bitcoin senses
everyone take their own responsibility when it comes to to the charts
okay, so looking at ar now, juan, um, we can pull back up to seven point nine to three dollars and eight dollars
if that is the case, take profit one is seven point fifty dollars
can you hear the seagulls outside? they're going crazy up here
okay, guys, how many people is here for the first time? if you're here for the first time, put 111 in the chat
if you're if you've been on my live stream multiple times, please write, write, 222, so i'll see the new people, and i'll see the people that have been supporting me for a long time
i do every single day updates about cryptocurrencies, but i also have a playlist for crypto trading for beginners
you can go in here and just go through everything and just try to connect the dots
but i always promote the first two videos, mark structure, part one and part two, because on these ones, this is when you see me being in profit, or take my my entries
it's based a lot up with a lot of tools, but definitely market structure is the one that that i look for
so master market structure, and trust me guys that you will be able to do whatever you want to do when it comes to the chart
um, when you go into my market structure part one and part two videos, you also have to go in and back test it
so i also made a series of back testing live streams that i have that i do have with you
we did have one yesterday, and i had to put you on the big screen
i talk about fibonacci, obviously, because fibonacci is something that i use all the time, as you can see, uh, supply and demand zone
so you have so many different technical tools and so many different things that we can do on the charts to be able to see what's going to happen
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this platform is great if you are especially swing trader, because there is a very low fees that bibit gives you gives us, and that's why we love it
by doing that, i need to go now, because i'm going to go to a game
one of my best friends is playing off, uh, he's playing american football
and i have no clue the rules when it comes to american football
fun story, last time i looked at this a game, he sent me a video for me to try to understand it
and he was like, did you look at the video? i was like, yeah, but you still don't understand anything, natalie
so i'm gonna go and look at something that i don't even know anything about
if you want to be part of my community, not only bitcoin census, lauren will give you the link to that community
as i told you, if you want to be part of my community, natalie, bitcoin census, you have so many, so many good people in here
it doesn't matter if you are a beginner, if you know nothing about trading
and we, we, we just want everyone to, you know, succeed in this
my name is josh, and as i'm recording this video, the price of bitcoin is potentially on its way down to that 17 000 price target
and this is happening as ethereum is breaking below its important level of support at just above 1 000
and at the time of recording in this video, the bitcoin price is actually getting quite close to the 300 week moving average, which is currently coming into play at just underneath seventeen thousand dollars per bitcoin
and if you're looking at the only other time throughout bitcoin's entire price history where we've seen the bitcoin price touched that 300 week moving average, which is the blue line, that was at the bottom of the march 2020 capitulation
and at that stage in the market, at the bottom of the march 2020 crash, we actually experienced a 50 dump in the bitcoin price in one single day
so that was actually one of bitcoin's most severe crashes throughout bitcoin's entire price history
and usually when we see a major downturn in the bitcoin price, in most cases, it ends in a capitulation, just a sharp drop off in the bitcoin price
and then eventually when we see a lot of leveraged positions gets liquidated and a lot of people just completely capitulate altogether
that is usually around the time where we see a major bitcoin bottom
after a lot of drawn out bearish price action, once again, we ended the bear market with a bang, a major capitulation to the downside
and right now, if you're looking at the weekly bitcoin charts, this massive, red, vertical candle does look like a massive capitulation like what we saw in march 2020 and towards the end of the 2018 bear markets
but what we need to see is some sort of weak form in the bitcoin price action, like what we saw in march 2020
we saw a massive week, basically a lot of buying demands coming in at lower prices
we're still on our way down, and we haven't yet seen that week of buying demand at lower prices, at least just yet
but once again, as i've been covering over the past few days, we have this bitcoin on chain chart showing us that bitcoin could potentially drop down towards 17 000
because these two lines on this chart right here, which are bitcoin on chain metrics, usually end up crossing over when we see a bear market bottom
according to the 2018 bear market bottom and the 2014 to 2015 bear market bottom, in both of those previous significant bitcoin bear markets, we saw these two lines cross over, and the bear market itself, in terms of the price action, actually bottomed out around these lines on these charts
in fact, if i zoom into what we saw at the end of the 2014 bear market, looking into early 2015, you can see right here at the bear market bottom, we actually dipped slightly below these two lines, but the bear market bottom was very close to these two lines
and it basically happens as these two lines were crossing over once again
and then if you're zooming into the 2018 bear market bottom, it's basically the same story
once again, we saw the bitcoin price actually drop slightly below both of these lines
but the bitcoin bear market bottom came into play pretty much as these two lines were crossing over
so now, considering what happened in these previous two significant bitcoin bear markets in 2014 and 2018, once again, zooming into the current bitcoin price action, and these two lines on the chart right now, we're actually getting very close to these two lines
in fact, the top line is coming into play at around 17 and a half thousand, and the bottom line is coming into play at around 16 and a half thousand
so they're most likely going to intersect at around 17 000, approximately
but remember, in both of the two previous bitcoin bear market bottoms, back in 2014 and 2018, the bitcoin price dipped slightly below these two lines when they crossed over
which means it's technically possible, according to bitcoin's previous history, that we could end up seeing a slight dip below 17 000, perhaps something like 16 16 and a half thousands
but obviously, that is just going off bitcoin's previous price history around these two onchain metrics
but what is really interesting about these two lines pointing towards around 16 and a half to 17 000 per bitcoin, is the fact that that is currently where the 300 week simple moving average is coming into play, as i just discussed in that previous bitcoin chart on the weekly time frame
and if you're looking at bitcoin's net unrealised losses, recently we've seen a massive spike in bitcoin's net unrealized losses, obviously
but if you're looking at the size of the spike in this bitcoin on chain metric, this is actually very, very similar to what we saw at the exact bottom of the march 2020 crash
but i went into this chart in much more detail in yesterday's video on the channel
so if you missed my last video, definitely check that one out if you want to know more information about this important onchain bitcoin chart
and just giving you a quick update on the bitcoin long positions on the bifidex exchange, right here on the daily time frame
and today, in fact, over the past few days, we haven't seen a lot of action in these long positions
and this entire chance is very interesting, because obviously we've been experiencing our fair share of bitcoin dumps
but despite the bitcoin price playing out multiple significant moves to the downside, these long positions are mostly remaining open
in fact, right now, at the current bitcoin price at the time of recording this video, the value of these bitcoin long positions is close to 2 billion us
and once again, they have not even budged at all over the past week or so
and just giving you an update on the shortterm bitcoin price action here on the fourhour chart
and obviously, you can see right here that the moment we confirmed a break below 20 000, which was our level of support we were looking at, then that essentially signaled our next leg to the downside, down to what's 17 to 18 000 at the time of recording this video
and if you're subscribed to this channel and you've been keeping up with my recent videos, especially over the past few days, then this move to the downside shouldn't have been too much of a surprise
because once again, over the past couple days, i've been talking about this bullish divergence essentially fading away because we're seeing some invalidation signals, like a lower height forming in the rsi
and that right there is basically a signal of weakness in this bullish divergence, showing us that the bearish momentum is beginning to build up a little bit more
but once again, i said the main focus is really that 20 000 level of support, because if we break below that level, then that is when we begin our next leg to the downside, once we confirm a break below 20 000, which we already have seen
and currently the bitcoin price is on its way down towards that 17 000 price target once again
and almost the same thing can be said about the ethereum short term price action here on the four hour charts
once again, we had this previous bullish diversions back here on the charts around five days ago
but over the past two days especially, i've been saying how this bullish divergence is essentially getting invalidated, because the rsi is breaking below this upper chaining line of supports
but the main support level in the ethereum price action itself that i've been paying attention to is around 1050, which is this fibonacci level right here, the 382 fibonacci level
at the time of recording in this video, we have broken below that level, which is why we started that next leg to the downside
and as for other levels of support for ethereum, i'll be looking towards the 50 retracement level right around here, which is coming into play at just underneath 700 per ethereum
but what is really interesting is if you're bringing out the 300 week moving average, that is this little blue line right here
because, of course, ethereum's price history isn't as long as bitcoin's price history, so the 300 week moving average has only just recently popped up on the charts
but with that being said, ethereum's 300 week moving average is currently coming into play at roughly around 900 per ethereum
and right now, as i'm recording this video, the price of ethereum is pretty much sitting right at that 300 week moving average
so that could be acting as some shortterm support for ethereum as well
before we start looking at that 700 level of support, once again, ideally we'd like to see a break below 900 per ethereum
and as i briefly mentioned in the bitcoin part of this video, one of the big parts of these capitulations to the downside is actually a lot of positions getting liquidated
and especially as of recent that has certainly been a big part of ethereum's downwards pressure, because in recent weeks, we've seen massive loans, like this over in d5, holding hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ethereum, essentially start getting liquidated, which means the massive amount of ethereum held as collateral in these loans is essentially getting dumped onto the markets, which, of course, pushes the price of ethereum lower
and then that liquidates even more loans over defy, which then dump more ethereum, which pushes the price lower
but soon enough, we'll eventually reach a point in the market where the majority of the debt, like these loans, the leverage, basically gets flushed out of the markets, which means we'll have a smaller risk of seeing more liquidations
but for now, once again, some of the biggest selling pressure, especially for ethereum, but really for the overall market, is just basically a lot of positions and loans, debt, basically getting liquidated, getting flushed out of the markets
but considering the fact that we don't have an infinite amount of debt in the market, there is a finite amount of debts, that means this massive cell pressure won't last forever
and that is when we could see a proper rally for bitcoin and ethereum, whether it's a full reversal or just a relief rally
and as always, i'll continue to provide realtime updates, just like this, over on my twitter
so if you have not followed me on my twitter, definitely make sure you're doing that
also, make sure to check out this video popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even when prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so we are breaking the bullish market structure that we've been holding since this started trading 13 years ago, which is pretty brutal
so as you can see, i'm sure a lot of you have already looked at the charts and have noticed that crane is currently capitulating below its previous fulltime high, back here in 2017
now why this is so important is because this is not something we've done before
if you look at the chart, you'll notice we have a arrangement of horizontal rays that are both green and red
the green horizontal rays mark the previous alltime highest from the past one, two, three, and i should probably put one up here, the past four cycles that we do have over on bitcoin
so if we look back at what happened, you can see the 2011 bull run, we came all the way up, had an alltime high, came back down
what happened next is, you know, we came up, made a new alltime high
and very importantly, when we did make our next cycle low, we made it above the previous alltime high
moving over into the next cycle, we obviously broke up, made a new alltime high, marking this green horizontal ray above this one
and once again, you never came back to that previous alltime high
but what are we doing at this moment in time? because you can see, we came down 2018, december 2018, came down, made the bear market low
we ran up, broke above the previous alltime high, made a new alltime high
and if we were following market structure, we would have bottomed already
but as you notice, this is from where we are at this moment in time
so i did just want to give you a quick update, letting you know this, uh, really not good in my opinion
and once again, i've been saying this in my past, uh, plethora of videos i've been talking about in my streams
but, you know, i i was saying i was here in 2018 for this bear market
and what i've been saying is, you know, if you are living through this bear market at this moment in time, yes, in terms of percentage drops, it may not be as bad
obviously, we can't celebrate the percentage drops at this moment in time because we haven't had the entirety of the cycle play out, or at least we don't know if we've had the entirety of the cycle play out
and if we mark what we've got going on right now, uh, this is a 72 percent drop
bear in mind, you know, from the previous cycles, we have pretty much experienced diminished returns, cycle over cycle over cycle
so if we look at this from the previous alltime highs down to the low, first cycle, this was a 94 drop
so, you know, according to the law of diminished returns, we should should be bottoming before an 84 percent drop
now, like i said, uh, if if you were back here in 2018, then you know that, you know, a lot of the markets were very shaky back then, but we really did not have, you know, the inflation levels
we didn't have the fed constantly increasing the interest rates
uh, you know, for the they've been increasing the interest rates higher than, you know, my entire lifetime
so, and i imagine most, most people's lifetimes uh, as well if you're not, you know, more than 30, 40, whatever years old it is
we are experiencing a bear market like we haven't seen before, at least in terms of price drops
it will continue to be the highest price drop, cycle over cycle
but nonetheless, we have broken market structure, which is very much something that is super, super bearish
now, in my opinion, the first pit stop should be round about where the, uh, bitcoin cme gap is
so if we come over to the bitcoin cme gaps, what you will notice is the next cme gap that we have
if we hop over to the daily time frame, so you can see a little bit better, we've got a big cme gap from down here, december 2020, that we never filled
and at this moment in time, this cme gap is residing at 18 500
now, once again, i made a whole video about this price target
but you know, first leg to the downside is going to be another 10 drop from where we are right now
in my opinion, 18 500 is probably the most conservative price target that you could have for this mic uh market cycle at this moment in time
the next leg down would be your 300 week, which historically has always been the bottom, even in the face of black swan events and massive amounts of fear, uncertainty and doubt
so, uh, honestly, i would really, really want to see 16 500 hold
because i think if we start sliding below 16 500, at least based on my ta, the only other thing that we would have is to come back down and fulfill this elliott wave theory
so if we hop over to the elliott wave chart, you can see, you know, from our cycle, low, let me put this on a log scale, from our cycle, low down here, we bottomed after having an abc correction into the 2018 bear market
that was the top of your one, two, three, four, five, bullish impulse
we've already had the a, we had the b, correctory wave, and we're seeing in the c right now
so as you can see, if we look at these minor waves, you've got your one, two, three, four, five
and while elliott wave theory is somewhat ambiguous as to the exact price target, it's gonna be at elliott wayfarer doesn't really tell you, uh, the exact price target we would be looking at
however, what we can say is, you know, if the elliott wave theory was to hold up, then we should be bottoming above the one wave, which is around about 14 000, which isn't 100 impossible
what i've personally been predicting is, i've been saying, i've been saying, filling the cme gap is in inevitability
i don't even think it's going to be like, okay, we might do this
so i do think we are going to come down and fill the cme gap, which, once again, is 18 500
uh, i do find it quite hard to believe that we would be closing weekly candle bodies below 16 500
have to emphasize that weekly candle bodies, because, yes, i really wouldn't be surprised if we had a quick wick down to maybe fifteen thousand, fourteen thousand
if we come down to fourteen, we'd uh, fulfill the elliott wave theory
and if we put a weekly close back above the 300 week, i do imagine we'd be having a big bounce coming in, even if i do not think, uh, the bear market is over in its entirety
so a couple of price targets for you, a little bit of food for four
like i said, market structure is currently breaking over on the bitcoin price
i think i'll be looking at how bitcoin is performing against the m2 money supply
so when we're accounting for inflation, we're already back down at the 300 week, which was, uh, very, very interesting
i'm just gonna post a link to the discord, get the chat up on my phone, and then we'll start the stream
let me load up the chat on my phone so i don't have to keep on going back onto this page
i load up my phone, and the first message i see is, the old crane will get slaughtered
this is, this is probably the most, uh, active i've had the chat out of all my streams
what's everyone's saying? um omran, what's up? vlad, what's up? uh, georgie, crypto, dude
i hate pronouncing, uh, people's names that sound complicated
dwarf, what's up? russell jones, uh, vacus, kid, crypto again
what's everyone saying? how's everyone doing? uh, do you mind covering the false top theory today? uh, what is the false top theory? i have not heard of that before
pretty weak bounce the dollar in the stock markets was worrying
i can't promise i won't stutter if i don't have to say the word economics
yeah, the dominance is heading down pretty strongly right now
we're still in our major fibonacci regions, so i'm really not worried about the dominance right now
like, we literally did this over here, like a month ago or so
uh, do you think we are going to consolidate here for a while? i really don't think we, uh, on what the the dominance or the, uh, crypto market charts
but the dominance, i have a feeling the dominance is going to go sideways until the next i have a bitcoin only rally, or bitcoin starts to massively move below 20 thousand
i think if bitcoin capitulates below 20 000, uh, you're probably going to see the bitcoin
uh, all pairs probably take another massive run to the upside once again
uh, how's kda? i haven't actually checked kd in a couple days
if you've been in the discord, i've been saying i've been pretty busy for the past couple of days, so i haven't kept up with these old cranes, so i'm gonna load them up one at a time
so, uh, the last video we made for kadena, i believe we were looking the four hourly time frame
i don't have my ema ribbons, and that's why i know we're looking at the daily time frame
we were calling for a move basically down to one dollar, which i still do think is on the table
uh, since my previous prediction, i do see something like a bear flag, i'm gonna go to go into the lower timeframes and see how it's panning out right now
but what we said in the last video is, if we do have a bounce, because at that time the dominance was starting to come down, if we do have a bounce, you're really not out of the clear until you at least take out the daily ema ribbons
so in my opinion, kadena is still showing extreme signs of weakness
and bear in mind, i've been covering this since 650, and a lot of the time, you know, not that i have anything wrong with it, but, you know, when we bounced up to like, six dollars, people, uh, were kind of like, you know, are you still calling for lower price targets? and then we broke down
once we bounced up to five dollars, people were asking me, am i still expecting lower price targets? uh, lower they were asking at 4 30, especially when we came up to 346, like this was a massive, massive bounce, and you can see all it did was come into the ema ribbons and start rolling back down, so we are still in the exact same position as we were from the last update
as you can see, i mean, i don't, i don't need to go through every single data point, but lower, high, lower high
i need to learn some of the, um, some of the commands on here to make my job easier
but, uh, as you can see, there's really, really not a lot of strength in the market right now
and i say relatively with a grain of salt, because it is very, very high
you know, when we have a big rally, this is going to take a big rally
so i still do think one dollars on the table would probably likely to start coming down
let's see what our previous fib from low to high is, because we've got our 1618 down here at 45 cent
i mean, even on the micro fibs, we could have drawn this out from like this uptrend all the way up here
and as you can see, you know, we're nowhere near any of the fibs that we need to be above
but as you can see, i mean, even from the most lowest uh, or even from the most recent macro impulse, or micro impulse rather, you're still under the 236
and at this moment in time, it looks like in the lower time frames, if i get rid of this, lower time frames, you're still struggling to get in the ema ribbons
i mean, i it's, it's not a precise technical because i really don't even see anyone else using the squeeze mom on youtube
but for example, if we talk about what happened over here, four hourly time frame, uh, constitutes these bunny hills so well
so, you know, you zoom out on kda, we look at this, we recognize, since six dollars and fifty seven dollars also, the downtrend has been perfectly defined by the four hourly ema ribbons
what you see here, little bunny hill into the four hourly ema ribbons
every time we have one of these bunny hills, uh, these correlate so perfectly, like i need to make a separate video about bunny hills, just because i, i really don't even think this is a thing
but it look, it doesn't look like he's correlating this to an oscillator
but this is just based on my ta, and it does seem to play out like literally every single time
and obviously all ta is made up by someone at some point in time
it looks like we're having a bonnie hill on the four hourly time frame
we are still in a pretty nice uptrend, but you can see, uh, left shoulder, right shoulder, we really need to start pushing above this invalidation point
and even if you do break above 188, you still do have to fight with the fourhour ema ribbons
and even if we did flip the fourhourly, you'd have to fight the daily
i mean, you know, you have a couple of days of a bounce, a couple of days of a bounce, a couple of days of bounce, a couple of days of bounce, and we're already trickling over into the red on the haikanashi
uh, as i've been saying for all of these old cranes, i do not think the bottom is in for any of them
i've been saying this for a long period of time, but in my opinion, the next leg to the downside is probably coming pretty soon for kda
and once again, my price target has not changed since we made the video up here at 194
i still do think one dollars on the table, uh? and bear in mind, one dollar is my conservative target
so when i say one dollars on the table, i mean that in my mind, one dollar is inevitable, but it's the most conservative price target you could possibly pull from at this moment in time
coming back down to these lows on basically all of your fibs, you really have no strength whatsoever
from this fib, you've only just broken 236 from the most recent, let's see, no, i can't do it from here
i'd need to draw it from here, from the most recent low to the high
i mean, even in these micro, micro, micro time frames, you are not even coming up to anything close, uh, to these orange boxes
and in fact, even in the micro time frames, we just got a pretty solid rejection from the six, one, eight
unless we get above two dollars, i really don't think we're bullish
and even if we do get above two dollars, my opinion will be the same
i think it will be a dead cat bounce before the next rollover
kda versus bitcoin, a lot of these old crane pairs have been performing relatively well against bitcoin, which is to be expected
and by the way, you might be looking at this thinking, where is this fib even drawn to? if we come over to the daily, it's the candle, body closes up here
once again, as you can see the the macro time frame has been completely invalidated
and, you know, granted, we do have somewhat potential of a double bottom w pattern playing out right now
but while you're, while you're below the 786, while the fed keeps on increasing the interest rates, while the bitcoin dominance is macro bullish, while it looks like we're in a recession, i really just don't think, um, i don't think kadena is going to be performing well for too much longer
so that should probably tell you something about the market structure, uh? and as you can see, if we look at the high quantities over on the weekly time frame for kadena against big crane, it is a pretty telling chart
like you can see, we have a lot of these wicks to the upside, which is kind of what we've done here
one dollar, once again, in my opinion, uh, i've been saying this for a while, but one dollar is is not my bottom price target
and i more likely think that we're probably going to head down to 80 cent
and bear in mind, once again, uh, i'm not saying i'm going to be dca at 80 cent, because i would not be surprised if, if we do break below 79, we could come all the way back down to the lows at like 31, which i know is absolutely, like, um, some kda fans might think that's blasphemy
but you know, the fact of the matter is, if you look back at what happened in the 2018 bear market, these old cranes do not hold up, uh, these old coins don't hold up well in a bear market
what do you think of algo? i think it's a good longterm project, as far as i'm, as far as i'm aware
but out of all of the blockchains that i've heavily researched on, and i know a lot of information on, algo is probably one of the most promising
uh, i believe it's called, what is it? because it's not net zero, it's net negative
so, you know, basically, if you use the algorithm blockchain instead of, you know, because people say, you know, using bitcoins bad for the environment, when you use al grand, they, they will use, you know, some of the monetary value to plant trees and stuff for the environment
i have hel, i have held algo for years now, but i currently don't hold any algorithm
i can't remember how often you get rewards, but i'm pretty sure it was like, every couple of hours
how often do i'll go awards? because i swear it was more than every one day rewards, uh, generated every 20 minutes
uh, is it going to be here forever? would i want to hold it for like, 10 years? absolutely not
would i maybe want to look at it if it's still a good performer in the next bear market, or in the next bull market, at the start of the next bull market, if it's still around, if it's still having partnerships, if it's still building, algorand is definitely one of the top ones that i actually do, uh, plan on looking on
so it's not often i have, you know, very, very positive words on on an oak crane
but once again, i would not marry an old queen, i do have to emphasize that
the second runup to alltime high was a false at the time the high, and that was the alltime high was in 2021, with a false top
so you've got the 2018 low, you've got your one impulse, uh, your two, your two correctory wave, three impulse, four correctory wave and five impulse
and it doesn't the five waves should have been higher than this
but, you know, the fact is, if you look at what happened in these waves, uh, i really don't think there's any other way to draw it, because you can see, you know, one, two, three, four, five
so, you know, we've already had one massive, massive leg to the downside
um, does that mean we can't go a lot lower in wave, in this final wave five? uh, i actually do think we're going a lot lower
once again, if we look at the the last impulse are in right now, you can see massive drop down to the one correctory wave, massive impulse down to the free correctory wave
so, you know, we should bottom, uh, at least according to elliott wave theory, above 14 000
and i'm personally not of the opinion that we're going that low
so, you know, once again, this is just the lowest target if elliott wave theory was to remain valid
and i have said this before in a lot of my earlier wave videos, uh, elliott wayfare is really not my favorite, um, my favorite theory
it can be quite openended, uh, quite and, uh, quite ambiguous
and some people do argue it's, you know, not ambiguous because there's a very finite er
well, there's a very specific set of rules, uh, that constitute elliott waves, like your, you know, your five, correct? like your five, your five waves in a four in a run, or a five wave to the downside, your abc
and they've all got these waves between them, and they all have to be measured at certain rates
but where, the, where you could draw it from, and where the price targets can go down to is ambiguously with the elliott waves
it would just say, you know, if you're in the last c wave, we should be above 14
best of luck with that, making us in the c wave down on the weekly
so i'll read through the comments until we get to the next request
and then i think, uh, some people want to see gst, and i imagine some people probably want to see some of the move to earn
okay? because i haven't looked at these charts for a couple of days, so you just have to bear with me
i think i talked about this last week, but we've literally just confirmed it in this week as well
i just want to highlight, the last time we did flip, light red over on the squeeze one was when we were having a train reversal on the 17th of january
as you can see, the last time we had a light red flip on the squeeze mom, we literally went down 80 percent
now, you know, once again, uh, just because it happened before, i'm not saying this is gonna happen again
uh, you know, past performance doesn't equals what we're gonna see today
but i still do think that this is a really, really bearish sign uh
so, i mean, it wouldn't even be like, it wouldn't even be out of the blue to potentially see a slight impulse from our low to high
you can see our fibs actually perfectly, perfectly line up with the weekly so, you know, in in the case that for some reason, old cranes decide to take one more last leg to the upside, uh, you could do something like this, but i'm really not counting on it
i just want to say, you know, if we do have another dead cat bounce, we're really not out of the water on the high kanashi's
so, you know, a lot of people look at the four hourly time frame, one hourly time frame, daily time frame, and say, you know, why are these all cranes bouncing? but, you know, as you can see, we had, if you look at this entire trend to the downside, what you'll notice is you have these these big, big wicks to the downside, uh, that get bought up on the weekly time frames
every single week we just have another wick back to the upside
so i'd imagine next week, uh, coming into, you know, saturday, sunday, friday of next week, i imagine 26 is probably the highest we're going to bounce
uh, squeeze bomb is trickling over into the light red, which is really, really not what you want to see
once again, i want to look at what's going on in the high quantities
and, yeah, it seems like we've just had another, another fakie
so, uh, once again, you can see little, uh, well, this is, you know, technically, i always talk about the bunny hills correlating to the four hourly time frame
so i'm gonna be checking that out in a second, seeing if these are bonnie hills
you've just got an m coming into another m, coming into another m, coming into another m
uh, in my opinion, there's really nothing to get out of bed for
um, so i'm gonna move on to the lower time frames to talk about, you know, personally, would i be shorting this right now? because, like i said, i've been quite busy for the past couple of days, so i really haven't been keeping up with these volts too heavily
but that being said, uh, i, i would imagine i'd definitely rather be short than long on solana right now
one daily timeframe is trickling back over to the downside since the last recent impulse, up to 35
head over to the four hourly, and i imagine we are going to be seeing bunny hills into the four hourly emas
let me remove drawings for a second so we can strictly focus on the bunny hills
so i was going to talk about what's been going on since may, so at least you've got a good perspective of what's been going on in the mid, uh, midterm time frames
if you look at the squeezebomb, this perfectly correlates to another
uh, this one was basically the same move we actually, we actually came down to reset this because this was basically such a big m and it was a lower high we didn't make a textbook bunny hill, or at least what i consider a textbook bunny hill
i mean, considering i'm the person who just, you know, invented these bunny hills or whatever, i guess i'd probably need to subside a set of rules for them before i do make a video for them
but nonetheless, you can always see these four hourly flips where you head over light term, or should i say, short term, bullish over on the four hour you just come into the ema ribbons, uh, squeeze one flips up to the upside, and you get pulled back down
once again, most recent bounce, we are already running out of momentum
but i'm going to head over to the lower time frames and see what is going on
so, you if you did have a big move below the six, one, eight, that'd probably be the place that i'd be looking too short because, if you, because right now we are above the, uh, short term ema ribbons
and i i never really liked to show, uh, while we're above the shortterm ema ribbon, so you're technically just above the 05
so once again, at this moment in time, i wouldn't be shorting
i'd be looking for this rejection from the fourhourly ema ribbons, which, by the way, i do think it's going to be coming into fruition
so, you know, if you're using five 2x leverage or something, i really wouldn't worry
but once again, like i said, this is not a trade that i would take at this moment in time
so if you are trading this, then, you know, i'm sure you already know this, but this is your trade, not mine
however, i do think it's probably likely we're gonna come back down to 29, maybe lollygag break down
and i think the breakdown below 297 is when you should probably start getting out of bed
so once we break below the 05, which in the next eight hours time, would allow you to also break below the uptrending level of support, i'd be waiting for about two four hourly candle body closes
so i'd give it four to eight hours, unless we strongly come down to the six, one, eight in like four hours, then it might just be a sign that we're having a big old queen market liquidation
and then at that moment in time, that would probably be where i'd be looking too short
if we check out the total crypto market cap, wow, bitcoin's really been beaten down this week
so total two, total one, has had, uh is basically lollygagging
so it seems like total two is is stuck in the middle of nowhere
but it's stuck in the middle of nowhere because it's waiting for the entirety of the crypto market to make a move
and at this moment in time, the total crypto market cap is sitting at slash, around 843 billion, which is where we are residing on the 200 week moving average
so i'd say a big move, you know, potentially even coming down another five percent, also would push us below these ema ribbons
and then i think that is when you're very, very likely to see a very, very quick flush out on bitcoin
but that that's kind of the period in time where i expect bitcoin to once again start outperforming
because once again, bitcoin dominance, if you go over to the weekly time frame, switch over to the high quality, it's been on an absolute murder spree
and, you know, this is kind of what people are kind of worrying about right now
people are saying, you know, why is, why is the bitcoin dominance having a correction? but, you know, in theory, this, this is just a little doji candle in a whole string of massive, massive moves to the upside
so i really wouldn't even be worried looking at this market structure if, you know, once again, we haven't even had um, because right here you can see, i mean, maybe if we switch over to the japanese candlesticks, it doesn't, it doesn't really look too nice
it just looks more like a textbook correction to the fibonacci
so i wouldn't constitute this as a ball flag, even though it looks like a bull flag
uh? or it did look like a bull flag over on the high kanashi's but in my opinion, you know, once again, if we zoom back on the bitcoin dominance
whether you want to put it on here or here, it doesn't really matter
so you know, as you know, if you do hold the six one eight, uh, market structure is very, very bullish
so the fact that we didn't even make it down to the six one eight the last time just shows how strong it is at this moment in time
so, uh, once again, if we do come down to the 44 percent region and then have a bounce, we could just be confirming this macro w breakout
and it looks like the price target is either hit or very close to being hit
and why 49 is very imperative to break above is because you can see, if we now bring back our og chart, oops, the the breakout target is is really around, i'd say 48 is once you are probably gonna start seeing the dominance once again, mooning so bitcoin dominance looks pretty good to me, i think, at some point, because it looks like solana wants to head down
now, like i said, on the four hour, it looks like we do have this bunny hill
but once again, i i wouldn't be short while we're above the micro fibs
i wouldn't be sure, you know, until we do have this big move down
so in my opinion, if i was going to short this, i'd probably short it from the 618 down to the 786
that's probably something i'm definitely going to include over on the discord um
i'm definitely interested in shorting this, but not at this moment in time
uh, hourly time frame, even though i really don't like looking at the hourly, i just want to see what's going on short term
you know, we're kind of just lowly gagging at this period in time
that's when i'd be very interested in taking a short on solana
but yeah, solana still looks like it wants to head down to lower price targets
but i said, in my opinion, solana is probably coming down to single digits
but nonetheless, what i kind of mean is we're probably gonna break below this and probably maybe head down to like, nine dollars
since i last made a video on this, we were at 43, and i was calling for a move down to 18
every time i make a prediction on green satoshi token, it almost, when i'm making the prediction, i'm, i'm like, because i'm just reading the charts, i'm just looking at the analysis objectively
and i look at it objectively, you know, my brain says, this is what's going to be happening, you know, because i look at ta like a robot
i think that's how traders get wrecked, bringing your emotions into the chart
but, you know, like i said, the ta, in my opinion, was saying, we're gonna drop like, uh, 57
and, you know, while i was saying that, my brain was like, yeah, that's right
but, you know, once again, we are, we are filling these price targets
i'm just looking at this objectively, down 43 since the last video
um, i can ask you, candles pretty not really a bear flag, although, no, i wouldn't call it, i wouldn't call it a bear flag
nonetheless, in my opinion, we are just lollygagging, trickling down before the next major, major move
once again, just look at, look at the daily hikinoshi candles
so, i mean, even if we let's just say that this was green candle, even though it was a tiny, tiny, dinky bump, uh? but let's just say the trend started shifting to the downside after that green candle
i mean, 27 days of moving down, nonstop, every single day, without a bounce, on green satoshi token volume is exponentially increasing
uh, at least out of the old coins that i've looked at today, which really haven't been many, because it's only the start of the stream, this really does not look like a good chart
let's see what is the next level down, because i do not think that 18 cent is gonna be the boston
bear in mind, you know, we take this one price target at a time
and the reason why we do that is because, you know, it's, it's very important to not say, you know, this is exactly where i think it's gonna bottom, and i'm not willing to change my opinion
what i do is i say, we're going to take it one step at a time
at this moment in time, the ta is calling for this price target
when we get lower, when we get closer to this price target, we're going to reanalyze the markets, because obviously we're gonna have things like, uh, you know, fomc meetings
you know, biden could be stirring up a storm in the economy once again
but nonetheless, this is why we look at this one step at a time
and as we are coming down to this price target, in my opinion, i do need a lower price target, because i do not think that 18 cent is going to hold for green satoshi token, even even though the market cap is relatively low
so it depends if the d gens are going to hold this um, what do you think about steppen a created a new market, which fueled by the need of earning
i don't know whether they're bearish or bullish, they're, they're saying, you know, this is great
but, yeah, if you don't know already, this is, this is obviously a ponzi scheme
as i have always said, with these move towards, they are around for a short time
and i was, if you're an og to my channel, you literally know that i've been saying this since we were around about, you know, four dollars
and, you know, people called me a father and said, it's going to the moon, when i was saying, you know, sure it's going to go up until the trend shifts bearish
because we were trading this, you know, we made a ton of money on green satoshi token, but more more importantly, we made a lot of money on green metaverse token when we started covering it ages ago
but nonetheless, we got out of it as soon as these ema ribbons started flipping bearish
since then, we've been expecting lower price targets, and it is heading down
so, once again, you know, i said this a couple of months ago, i'm going to say it again, these are all ponzi schemes
you know, the only way that you can make money on these pyramid schemes is if someone else comes in below you and buys a shoe, buys a token to buy a shoe, adds to the market cap, and that way they're able to use that market cap to give you rewards
so if you don't know already, these are all pyramid schemes, and they are not going to last that long
you know, once open interest and these, uh, move to earn starts to subside, you're gonna start seeing massive moves to the downside, which is what we're already seeing
once again, like i've been saying, uh, this highlights my point
exactly when all the hype was in this project, it was up here at 940
you know, people that the thing is, people think, um, you know, these move to earns are going to be great to hold, uh, and earn from over the bear market
and, you know, if you've got a mad shoe game down, and you just know all the ins and outs, then fair enough
but if everyone has the same mindset that they're not gonna buy green satoshi token, if they're not gonna buy new shoes, and they're only going to go and run and, you know, earn green satoshi tokens, you're going to start to see the market slide massively, landsliding
that's what we've seen from 944 all the way down here to 25 cents
so once again, the only way these move to earns will ever survive is if there is a nonstop flow of new investors
so the only way you'll make money off on this is if someone else comes and is willing to, you know, pay for more of it
so, you know, once again, it's probably not going to last a long time
but you know, the next level down, we need to start looking at new fibs, because these four hourly ones are invalidated
is that the one we were running off? because that looks the same, it's like, the same price target
so you've got another area of confluence down here at 18 cents
so this is going to be a massive, massive level, either of a support or resistance flip
if we bounce on it, you know, you might be able to see a massive 2x rally back up to, you know, almost 32
if we capitulate below 18, then this is probably going to the gutter
so, uh, this fib actually, let's keep it high level of confluence right here
we get rid of this arrow low to the high, your next level down to be 11 cents
so at this moment in time, i do have a new prediction on green satoshi token
so, you know, once again, i'm going to keep this previous prediction on the chart because we were predicting a 57 move, uh? and i do want to see, you know, once this pans out, i do want to be able to remove this and be happy that the target has been hit
so, you know, once again, i do not have any of the move to earn shoes or anything like that
but if you have some, you know, magical game pattern down where, you know, you're somehow able to make a ton of money from it, then, you know, go ahead and do your thing
but i don't think this would be something that i'd be looking to touch whatsoever
and then your next level down from that would be down here at eight cent
i really want to know what will happen with algo, as algo will be sponsoring fifa, which is bullish news
uh, this would make high price on november, world cup will start
i think it's going to be a buy the rumor, sell the news by the time the world cup starts, for example, everyone said the set the exact same thing for cryptocom
as soon as cryptocom bought, um, what was it called? they bought a specific stadium
and let me just prove my point here, um, cro buys stadium, staple center
and a lot of people don't understand why the rumors sell the news
because everyone was saying, when it comes to december, you know, everyone in their nan was saying, as soon as december comes, uh, it is gonna moon to, you know, five dollars, ten dollars, all these crazy price targets
but this was the exact top as soon as they announced they were buying the staples center
you know, we basically trickled into, the um, we trickled into, i believe it was the lakers that were playing that day
i only play it, so i'm not a fan of watching sports, uh, only playing them
so it seemed, once again, you know, you did have a rally into this, so let's, let's find the exact date, just like we did rally on the algo price, by the way
so, you know, one algo, we did rally when the, uh, the news came out
but, you know, this was literally within correlation of a couple of days at the top
so i don't think that by time the fifa partnership is coming out, that that's going to be bullish news
for example, we pumped on cryptocom on the news, because the news came out of nowhere
and everyone and everyone in their nan in the com ecosystem, was saying, as soon as the game comes in december, uh, i believe it was christmas time was where it was, the day after christmas, boxing day
everyone was saying, you know, the lakers game is on, uh, this is when cryptocom is going to moon
and that literally marks, you know, pretty much the exact top round about here, as soon as the game came into fruition, massive landslide ever since
and i especially wouldn't be buying owl grand at this period in time, considering the, uh, in my opinion at least, which is, it's not really an opinion
if you look back at every buy the rumor, sell the news event, uh, in the past year, all of them have played out
if you look at the axi update, everyone was so bullish on the axi origins coming out, mark the exact exact top
everyone was bullish about the solana open sea integration, marked the exact local top before we started moving down
and in my opinion, people are bullish on the ethereum merge, but this is when i think ethereum's probably gonna head down to much lower price targets
can you get a fair value of kadena? uh, it's, it's hard to define what the fair value of kadena is at this moment in time
uh, it has not, you know, proved its muscle and and been around for a plethora of time to kind of say that it would have a super, super high level of value
you know, a lot of people got bullish on this as well, you know, including myself
i think it's got a great nft market uh, nft marketplaces, uh, one of the strongest marketplaces out there
um, for example, you know, in terms of price, uh, more people use ethereum, but in terms of overall transactions, more people use solana
so i still do think, once again, kadena has a very, very long time to prove itself before i would give itself anything of a fair value
in my opinion, the fair value of solana, or, sorry, the fair value of kda, be around 30 million or something, which would be about a 90 percent drop from where we are
so, you know, 15 to 17 is what i'd associate the fair value of cadena on
and once again, uh, you know, i'm not saying that it's gonna go down to those price targets
but in my opinion, that is the fair value of kadena, much lower than we are right now
i think, you know, the old cranes are having a bounce, including kadena, because the bitcoin dominance is heading down
and, you know, obviously bitcoin is taking a massive tumble right now, and old cranes are temporarily outperforming them
but i think this is only because, you know, and i say this in the nicest way, because i, i even refer to myself as a, as a degenerate, uh
but nonetheless, oak coin degenerates are buying the dip on their favorite oak cranes
they have been buying the dip, you know, the whole way down, specifically for gadena
um, you know, a lot of people have been telling me they've been buying the dip down since, uh, 650 or something, or even higher than that
but nonetheless, i do really just think this is degenerates buying the dip on their favorite oak cranes
and bear in mind, all claims have a much lower market cap than bitcoin
pair that with the fact that you look at the haikanashi candles on bitcoin, and we've basically been in a straight run up for the past couple of months
yes, we've taken a couple of breathers, we are holding all of our major important fibs
i don't think these old cranes are going to outperform bitcoin for too much longer
once bitcoin breaks below the previous alltime high, i think there is going to be mass fear running into the market, and that's when i think alts are going to start heading down
oops, what did i do? how do i even get here? how do i get to ada? if you click space
all right, i never knew this, so we just found out something together
so if i'm on solana and my next chart down is soul btc, i can just click space and i'll head down
uh, gala, yeah, we'll check out what's going on with gala quickly
i i really don't think bitcoin is going to be down below 16 500 for long
and once again, i wouldn't be surprised if we had a wick below it
but in terms of the weekly time frame, in my opinion, once again, my very subjective opinion, because i do not have a crystal ball, i don't think we're going to close more than a weekly candle body below sixteen thousand five hundred
but nonetheless, uh, when you get a free 10 minute, 10 minutes, just see his elliott wave count
uh, my elite wave count, or someone else's? um, uh, i can't see you recommending anyone else's
so do you mean mine? let me know you asking if you want to see the eliot waves again
uh, i don't think it's time to buy alts yet, but nonetheless, the sidelines are the place to be
thoughts on kadena fundamentals? uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a good blockchain, but like i said, they, they need to prove themselves
uh, i don't think kadena has like, the craziest, most amazing fundamentals in the world, but, you know, i do think it's a pretty cool project
a couple of people asked for helium eagle, fitfire, tron atom, avac stamps
whoever sends the next message in the chat underneath tech world, uh, asking for gala and hb, i'll cover next
so i'll just wait for the next message and i'll cover that one
any thoughts on the tron stable crane? dpeg, i don't keep up with the tron eco system too much
if i'm not mistaken, it's usdd, or is this something else? like i said, i really don't keep up with, um, with tron, so, oh, i've searched for this before
it is usdd, uh, if you don't already follow me on twitter, then you might not know my perspective on tron
let me see, because, um, let's see, it was, uh, he copied something that justin trun, justin sun said, or stable quan
so this is what stable kwon said, uh, deploying more capital steady lights just before the lunar, uh, rugball
and it seems like, uh, justin tron, uh, well, justin suntron is either, you know, meaning this or, yeah, i don't know, but they've both got algorithmic stable coins, and i, i don't know, usdd, see how hard the dpeg is
in my opinion, the next major d peg, the next major stable crane that is going to dpeg, is going to be usdd, that's just my opinion
you know, i would really not be surprised if this had headed down to like, 50, cent, 30 cent
and then maybe, if it is one of, uh, one of these algorithmic stable coins that really can be, uh, completely manipulated, kind of like, uh, kind of like what happened with a usdt
i do think tron is massively, massively going to get wrecked this market cycle
so was that, was this actually an 88? i seem to remember it being like a, a six or seven percent trade
but this is where we shorted from, and at the time we actually came down and bounced in the lower time frames
so we had a big, big bounce back up, uh, from when we came down to this thing
and we went a little bit further, like we could have done this more, but nonetheless, uh, tron is probably the next one to dpeg, in my opinion
but in terms of the tron price macro time frame, 786 is literally your last line in the sand now
uh, ema ribbons on the weekly timeframe look like they want to flip bearish
after we break below there, as we've already come down to this next level level of support, the next line down is all the way down to here
so in my opinion, tron is probably going to come down about another 40, 40, uh, 405 percent very, very soon
uh, tron short or too early? i wouldn't short this at this moment in time
i always say this, but i like to play my leveraged lungs, or leverage shorts, from a position of strength
and at this moment in time, you know, i wouldn't be surprised if we had a dead cat bounce to the upside
we've got a inverse head and shoulders, which is a bullish pattern
even if it does, i do not see us getting above 67, which is where the top of these four alley ema ribbons come in
i think it's gonna start massively heading down, the place to short
uh, so you can have a conservative breakdown at 57, but i think once you start putting in those daily candle body closes below 54, that is the time to short, because we would have massively, massively capitulated below this uptrend's been in play since the 22nd of june
and i will be keeping my eyes on it, um, because i do want a short tron
uh, i don't long bitcoin in bear markets, and i don't short bitcoin in bull markets
so when bitcoins in a bull run, i like to, i only like to long bitcoin
when bitcoins in a bear run, i literally only look for shorts
because, you know, the matter of the fact is, if you're shorting in a bear market, you'll have a much higher likelihood of having the trade pan out
because how bull markets work is, most of the time, you know, for example, if you're, if you're in an uptrend in a bull run, uh, and you do something like, let me take that back, if you're in a massive uptrend in a bull run, and you do something like this, and you'd say, okay, you know, if we come down to the 618, this is probably like, for example, if you did something like this in a bull run, and you were saying, okay, it looks like we're probably going to come down to these fibs, so let's short this down to the 618
in a bull run, it's much more likely that you'll just have a complete fake out where you won't even come down here
like, if you're having a massive move to the downside in a bear market, and you start to see a slight bounce, you know, you could say, you know, this is the area to short
but you know, in a bear market, it's a lot more likely that you're just going to start heading down before you come up to these bullish price targets
so for example, the last major crab market we had was just after bitcoin bottom down here
let's go over to the bitcoin alltime chart just to show you what i mean
and from here, oops, from here to here, this whole phase, this was kind of like a crab market
and then once again, you know, yes, the bull run really started down here
but, um, you know this, this would be the time to flip long only, you know, this was the crab market, but nonetheless, we were still sitting in a, in a macro ball
it's much, much safer to only shorten a bear market, in my opinion
i look like, like i said, i look at this, um, i look at charts like a robot
what about ada and xrp? a good time to short? i don't know about ada, but xrp is probably always a good time to show
one of my favorite things to do with xrp is to put it in the inverse chart
because when you do look at, oh no, what did i do? i've looked the price scale
so one of my favorite things to do with xrp is just remove this and look how bullish this market structure is
you can see, i mean, obviously disregarding the accumulation range over here, you know, you've got your bear market
and you accumulated to the side because you've got extreme strength while you're up at these price targets
this was, uh, quote, unquote, the bear market in the inverse chart
so, you know, for example, down here, this was a massive, massive higher low
and what you've got over on xrp is a massive, massive macro w panning out into a mid to micro term w panning out into a micro w that's breaking up to the upside
and it looks like, in my opinion, xrp is coming up to its last range of resistance before it breaks to the moon
and obviously, we're using the inverse chart, so we're probably gonna break to hell, in my opinion
to answer your question, it's probably always a good time, uh, if you're shorting xrp on like a 25 x leverage, and you could probably leave for like, five years, as long as you've got enough funding fees
and, you know, this will probably go down to zero at some point
we've broken down from macro bearish pennant, and on the four hourly time frame, it looks like we're consolidating within the next bearish pen so i'd be waiting for the breakdown
i don't really like, um, looking at a macro trend and saying, you know, it's probably gonna go down, so i'll leave it on, like a 2x leverage to the downside
uh, you know, i have so many trades and i keep up so many charts that i do just like to make quick trades in and out
i really don't like to hold trades for more than 24 hours or a couple of in a bull market
with bitcoin, i like to hold longs, like look like, you know, 5x leverage, 2x leverage, 25x leverage for month
but, you know, when we're coming into this bearish phase, you know, i, i definitely wouldn't be holding it for too long
but, yeah, xrp pretty much heading to zero, probably coming down to 18
might expect to bounce from then, but, you know, the cascade will continue
you know, like i said, uh, this is the most bullish chart in all of crypto on the inverse scale
and, you know, that should obviously spell that it's the most bearish chart over on the um over on the regular scale
and also with xrp, like i said, you can literally, if you, if you left the market, um, obviously you wouldn't have been able to do it from here, because we dropped, we dropped a mental percentage, yeah
but for example, like if you were holding xrp back from the top here in the 2018 run, even in the 2021 run, this was a lower high, we didn't even make it to two dollars
and all the xrp cult was saying the xrp was going to like 100 or 10 was their most conservative target
and we came up to two dollars, and now we're breaking back down to hell
so, xrp, garbage, centralized bank of crane, going to zero, in my opinion
uh, am i any trades at this moment? uh, no, i'm not in any trades at this moment in time
um, i i've been pre like i said, i've been pretty busy for the past couple of days
i've been, uh, revamping my, my, uh, recording studio setup, which i probably will post on, uh, twitter tomorrow
uh, i, i'm waiting, i'm waiting for the good lighting to come back so i can take a take a photo
uh, was is, was that someone's xrp target? uh, 989, ust, maybe
what's terror again? what's the crane terrace stable coin called? that's why it's called us terror
or has it just been taken out? has it been taken out? it is ust
now, like i said, i really don't keep up with the lunar ecosystem that much, but, yeah, i mean, this would go up to, you know, 500, 600 against ust, but it's definitely not going to like 500
oh, so if it came down another peg, xrp would take it out, which is quite interesting
okay, you know, when your favorite cryptocurrency um, when your favorite cryptocurrency cult starts pulling out, you know, uh, predictions from the simpsons, then it's not a good sign
all right, where's my a to btc? do i have a to btc? i do have a to btc
so ada has been having a bounce on the weekly time frame against bitcrane
looking at the weekly squeeze mom, we're already trickling over into light red
so, yeah, i'd say the next leg to the downside is probably coming for ada
the last time we did make a video on ada, i believe we were here
uh, oh, there's a few cryptocurrencies that are quite popular that i'm just not really too interested in covering
i will cover them whenever i see something macro going on, but ada and ethereum are never really going to be something i want to cover macro term on my channel
i do think ada and eth will do well, even though i'm not necessarily the biggest fans of either of them
uh, but looking at it objectively, i do think they are here to stay for at least another cycle
but with that being said, like i said, i'm just, i'm just not too interested in them
the last prediction we made for this, we were saying it's gonna drop 33 down to 36 cent
but as we've now flipped back below, it seems like the trend has come back into play
when was the last time we did this? so, yeah, it's actually not too often that you do have these big fake outs over on the four hour and as we flip back below them now, i'd say that's the nail in the coffin
aid is probably coming right down to 36 when bitcoin takes out 20 000, which i could imagine would probably happen in the next week, maybe the next couple of days, ada is coming right down to 36 cent
and the next major, major target we actually have is down here at 29, which really isn't actually too much of a big drop
you've got, ma, i think you've got massive support back down here at the start of the trend, 12 cent
so i if i had to make like a macro ada prediction of where ada could probably bottom in this bear market, i don't think 12 cent is too off the table
about another 75 drop, but let's be relatively conservative and talk about the 1618 down here, 22 cent i do see coming into fruition
so as of right now, i would say another 54 drop to the downside is probably going to come into fruition
but you know, like i said, our last price target, which we were predicting was a 34 drop, is still in place
uh, bitcoin, ta, uh, there's there's not too much to update on bitcoin
let's see what the selling volume is like on major leverage exchanges
uh, the next level down is 18 and it looks like we're getting the volume to pull us down to here
so i'd probably say bitcoins probably gonna drop ten percent next week
i haven't checked out the waves chart, but i will check out quickly
um, let's pull this off, and then i'll quickly check check out bitcoin, and we'll move on to waves
uh, algo was one of the first ones we covered at the start of the stream
and in my opinion, 16 600 is probably in play by the next fomc meeting, which i believe is approximately 41 days from today
uh, i've been gone for the past couple of days, so i guess it just left my head
what is the chicago mercantile exchange predicting? so, so the meeting day is the 27th, so they've got the uptodate, and they are predicting another 100 likelihood of another interest rate hike, which is, yikes
and i made a post about this over on my twitter as well, while we are on, uh, while we are on the case of my twitter, once again, i'm going to shamelessly plug it, because we are coming up for 1 000 followers, so i do want to hit this, uh, very soon
so if you want to follow me over on twitter, at 618 underscore cowboy
uh, i post tons of updates over on uh, and just, you know, good information and stuff over on twitter
says the fed could uh raise the uh, sorry, let me start that again
paulo says the fed could hike rates by, uh, at 075 percentage increase in july
reshared this because i do think this is also good information over on frankie blanco's twitter
so, if the june monthly cpi is zero, so for example, you know, once again, the next cpi, if this does come out zero, uh, it will bring the year to date cpi down from eight point six percent to seven point six percent
and hypothetically, it would take nine months of zero cpi increases to reach 25 yeartodate cpi
so i, i really do think we are in for like, a very, very long, drawnout period to the downside
i think even in your best case scenario, if the fed relatively quickly gets their hold on inflation, i think people underestimate how long this is going to play out for
you know, we are coming down to much, much lower price targets
so i think it's, um, it's a little bit hopeful to kind of expect, you know, bitcoin to previous alltime high, and then, you know, lollygag moon 100k within the next year or two
because, you know, if you know me, 90 of my bags are in bitcoin
uh, fitfire, i think we've had quite a few requests for that, so we'll check out fitfire
uh, we also said we'd check out wave, so i'll check out waves, and then we'll move on to fit fry um
uh, do do you see soul dropping to single digits now they've implemented the new dynamic chain? yeah, i do see all all cranes going down, even if they do make improvements
but nonetheless, i, i do think it is good that soul is making improvements
it needed to make improvements for me to even consider to, uh, to invest in it again
uh, but nonetheless, seoul, it's probably not going to be a good play until the start of the next ball run
which, once again, like i've been saying, until the fed starts backpedaling, and they start decreasing the interest rates
and i said that the last two cme meetings, and we've dropped from both of them
so, oh, we've actually hit the last price target i made on waves
i don't remember the last time i made a video on waves, but we were up here at 718, and we were calling for a 31 drop down to 488, and it came into fruition
so next level down, as we have already bounced from the lows, would be all the way down here, at the start of the trend, down here at two dollars
so as we've hit this price target, you know, the, you know the, uh, you know, the next move, we obviously have to have a new target
so once again, 55 percent drop, in my opinion, is incoming for waves
it has lost its uh, or its usdn neutrino stable crane lost its peg a while ago, and it is currently sitting just just below the area that it should be at
uh, obviously there's gonna be a large subset of oak cranes that are going to go to zero and never recover
if it's going to be any old crane, then it's probably going to be cryptos like xrp and waves
uh, that, you know, you know, people are getting very, very bullish on things like xrp this market cycle
but i think once the bear market comes in and xrp goes to much lower price targets, and, you know, the people actually realize that all it did was make a lower high, and it's been underperforming bitcoin for years, then, you know, people are gonna move on to new things
uh, what target? uh, what target hikes on fed for next month? july, august
so i think it goes to july and september, because they don't have them every month
we're going to have one in september, one in november, one in december
so for the rest of the year, we're only going to have four more fomcs
you know, once again, i said this earlier on in the stream, but, you know, the chicago mercantile exchange is predicting 100, like a 100 likelihood of a increase in the interest rates
and i would have to say i probably 99 agree with them at this moment in time
i do think that once again, interest rates are going to be raised
jerome powell has already started to hint about another 75 basis point increase, which, once again, this was something we talked about earlier on in the stream, which i did share over on my twitter
so once again, if you want these updates for my twitter, be sure to head over to 618 at underscore cowboy
literally almost a thousand subs, so let's, uh, hopefully we can get that to 1000 by today or tomorrow
i'm not sure, but yeah, 75 basis points for the next month is what i'm predicting
i'd like to um, i'd like to see what the inflation numbers are going to be like over the next, over the next 30 days
because, like i said, you know, previously there wasn't like 100 way that we were able to predict that the interest rates were going to move up, uh, by 75 basis points
but as soon as the cpi numbers came out at 86, i was religiously telling you, you know, 75 basis point is incoming
so within the next month, we're going to see more inflation numbers
if the inflation numbers are, once again, still running rampant, then the cpi report, or, you know, rather the fomc meeting, next fomc, is very, very likely that we're going to increase another 75
can you imagine what the markets would do if we increased by one basis point? that would be absolutely brutal
so i think what i'm gonna do, because i've only got so much time, i think what i'm gonna do is i'm going to rapid fire through these old cranes, i'm not gonna do a ton of explaining on them
i'm just gonna because i i pretty much look at these charts and within a couple of seconds i've already formulated my opinion, and i'm really just explaining what i see
but i i will because i know people want to see near bnb vet, uh, you know, steppen fitfi, etc, etc
so i'm just gonna run through a bunch of these really quickly, get some of them out the way, and then if you want a further explanation, then you can always ask, where is fitfire? this is the problem of covering so many old cranes
all right, it must be down the bottom here, somewhere, somewhere, here
so the last video, we were saying that your macro price target is still down here, 37
daily time frame, your most recent impulse, from the swing high down to the swing low
you perfectly, perfectly pumped up to the 618, massive, massive macro rejection
we are in a bull flag though, so i wouldn't be shorting at this period in time
uh, especially as the daily squeeze bomb is starting to trickle over to the upside
but in my opinion, we're seeing bullish technicals that are not going to come into fruition
because, like i said earlier, in my opinion, bitcoins getting ready for that break below 19800, which was the previous alltime high
after we break below 19800, i think there's gonna be mass panic coming into the market, then gonna move down to the next line in the sand, which was your cme futures gap inverse bart simpson over on the chart here
this is going to absolutely wreck the old cranes, in my opinion
and that is when we're going to start to see a move down for fit fire
so i wouldn't want to be long for fit fire, for hourly running out momentum
uh, once again, you know, what happens in the next day or two isn't necessarily what i'd like to predict for fit fire
within the next couple of weeks, i think 37 is going to be on the table
um, kadena, i've already, yeah, i've already covered kadena epic media
uh, i'm sorry, but that is absolute uh, you know, i hate to burst the bubble, but kadena is absolutely nothing compared to some of, some of the cryptocurrencies out there
i'm not saying it's a bad project, but you know, when you say that it's a the best project, you're comparing it against things like bitcoin
and, yeah, uh, cadena is absolutely nothing compared to the likes of bitcoin
i do think it's gonna perform really well in the next ball run
but at this moment in time, we're in a bear market, so i think it's going to get wrecked
if it keeps on solidifying itself as a good project, so be it
but one dollar down to 80 is probably, it's probably what's going to come into fruition
uh, actually, wait, we need to, we need to cover some of the other ones
so the last near video, we were predicting a 37 drop to the downside
so i can ask you, candles, you haven't even started to put any green in whatsoever
uh, bearish volume is absolutely swarming near, right? now, uh, daily squeeze more massively, heading to the downside
a really, really nasty bear flag, bearish pen, or whatever you want to call it
but yeah, uh, near near is, once again, this is probably one of the uglier, uh uglier oak crane charts that i've been covering today
uh, once again, as we always do, you know the motto of this channel, we've made a price prediction
we now need our next level to the downside now, right off the bat, your next i was about to say that would be too bearish, but back down to the lows is really not actually too far
and at this moment in time, i do believe that near is a good project
however, like solana and like some other cryptocurrency projects that haven't been around for the longest period in time, they do have a lot to prove
and i think it's kind of wrong looking at cryptocurrencies in the terms of the value they produce
i would only really care about the value of bitcoin and maybe some others that i do invest in
but you know, if you're trading these cryptos just to make a buck, then it's more about pump mentals, fun pump mentals, technicals and social metrics
and you know, like i said, i i do think near probably has a lot to come to the downside
i mean, i, i think it would be conservative to say that near, in a bear market, would hold 1 billion, which is way, way more than a 50 drop
and as we are breaking down from this bear flag slash bearish pennant, your next level down would be just below this
i think near is coming down in the next couple of weeks to the next month, anywhere between one dollar and fifty cent all the way down to one dollar and thirty cent
hp, kings, uh, will you let us know when you start dca, and old cranes, yeah, i definitely will
i will be dca'ing old coins when i believe the bitcoin bottom is in, but i will be buying them for a trade
if you watch my channel already, you know you've probably heard me talk about this multiple times
bitcoin bottoms, old cranes outperformed for like one month, for two months
and then bitcoin, what bitcoin did is, it had its low, it had its pump, and it came down, and it made a higher low, and then it started moving up
you know, they had uh a shortterm rally against their bitcoin pairs
we're looking at how kadana performed against uh, against bitcoin
and this is the same if you look at litecoin, if you look at uh xrp, if you look at ethereum, if you look at all of the cryptos that were back here in 2018, they all did the same thing, outperform bitcoin for two months
that is when i plan on shortterm trading all cranes to the upside
and then as i start to see indicators, like down here, you can see weekly squeeze mom started to flip bearish, that was the time to sell
if you flipped on the weekly squeeze mom, you would have sold at the 15th of april
even if you sold at the bottom of the weekly, just to be sure, it subsequently would have dropped another 70 to 71 against bitcoin
and by the way, we're looking at ada, which is one of the highest outperformers in the market
so i i don't think it's too bearish whatsoever to expect another massive leg to the downside
but as you can see, this kind of area, once i believe bitcoin is bottom, this is when i'm going to be making short term trades
then i'm going to be taking my profits, i'm going to be moving them back into bitcoin
and then i'll be sitting on into bitcoin for the next couple of months, the next six months, the next, i don't want to say a year, because i don't think it's going to play out exactly as before
and i would like to dca around this general area, which i do think is once again going to come into fruition
but yeah, that's basically when i plan on, a plan on starting to trade
but like i said, you know, i i wouldn't be buying oak cranes until the fed pivots
so if the fed, fomc meeting after fomc meeting after fomc meeting, increases the interest rates again and again and again
i'm just going to keep on saying this, the bottom is not in until the fed starts the back pedal
so the time to buy alts is when the fed says, uh, we're not going to increase the interest rates anymore
i like your channel, because kda at 80, 80 cent is what i want to hear
yeah, i mean, we're just, we're just looking at things objectively
and, i mean, it looks like the oak cranes want to take a massive load to the downside
i mean, if you're in these altcoins for the long term as well, you know, you might as well want them to go lower
for example, i'm in bitcoin for the long term, and i, i want nothing more than for bitcoin to massively pull down to like, sixteen thousand, fifteen thousand, uh? because this is where i wanna buy a bitcoin
so, yeah, i mean, if you're in these projects for the long term, might as well buy cheap
my phone's running out of charge, so i might have to think, uh, think of another thing
so if i'm not mistaken, bnb btc as along with, if btc were one of the best performers, or bnb was holding up very, very well, should i say
but i do think bnb's next leg to the downside will be a lot more brutal, especially with binance going after them for being a security
let's do um, i wish i knew how to do can you even do polls? is that something i can do in the chat? can i ask a poll? oh, my god, i can create a poll
is bnb a security? you can answer yes or no, or do you lot think? because finance is going after them, uh, for being a security
uh, the the sec, the securities exchange commission, is going after finance for being a security what do you think? i'll give you my answer
oh, is this the participants in in the comment section, or is this the participants in the poll? because it doesn't specify
so check out bnb, and then i'll come back to the poll and i'll give you my answer
this is, this has started to come into fruition very, very fast
uh, once again, this is one of those things where bnb was holding up very, very well, and it's got a massively high market cap, and a lot of people talking about this
but, you know, once again, we were looking at the data objectively, and we were calling for a 42 percent drop on finance, from 280 down to 160, which sounds very, very bearish
we're more than halfway down, and i do think this move is going to keep on coming
so at this moment in time, nothing has really changed over on finance
as i always say, old coins do not hold their 786 fibonaccis in a bear market
you go back to 2018, none of them, absolutely none of them held the 786
every single walk queen capitulated below the 786, did a crab market and then went into another ball run
but nonetheless, uh, my price target is unchanged for binance
but my where, i kind of think this would be coming down into the bear market lows, would be like another 54 drop down to 100
uh? this is backed up by you know, psychological analysis, people always look at big, round numbers
i'm just responding to my friend because i'm going to be meeting, um, i'm going to be meeting a few people after this, so i'm gonna be wrapping up the stream when my friends come over
we covered everything from, uh, cadena, algo, bnb, waves, fit fi, g uh gst
this is probably why you're coming into your ema ribbons line of best fit
do we have any bunny hills? it's been, it's been showing a lot of weakness, to be fair
so, i mean, we haven't had a move into the ema ribbons for a very, very long period of time
but this move up, as you can see, like i don't want to go through every example, but you can see bounce into the emas
and at this moment in time, we are coming into the emas, and the squeeze bomb is already starting to trickle down into the downside
on the four hour i want to see, are we coming into dark green, indicative that this is the top? no, we're actually starting to trickle back into light green, which is a short term bullish signal, which might mean that this head and shoulders may not actually play out, uh
but once again, still macro time frames, probably going down to the 1618 at 229, bear market low
i mean, once again, my favorite thing to do is look at cryptocurrencies that are in price discovery to the downside, and flip their chart and then look at them and, you know, imagine this is a completely different a, a different coin
as you can see, massive, massive runup, new alltime high, back tested the previous alltime high
and obviously, bear in mind we are in price discovery to the upside on the inverse chart
so this is probably going to mean, this is probably going to go down for a massive leg to the downside
what's the best way to identify divergence? uh, so let's, let's try and find some divergences
so if we get rid of the squeezed mom temporarily, my favorite thing to look for divergences on is the relative strength index
so at this moment in time, oscillator and price is moving up at the same time
korean satoshi token is just bleeding out to hell over on the oscillator
once again, i'm gonna be wrapping up the stream relatively soon because i have people coming over
does uh, does anyone in the chat know of any cryptocurrencies that are having divergences right now? so i can give an example, uh
so, so most people say binance is not a security, which is interesting
so where did bnb, uh, what's the right word for this, have its ico? so it's based in china, so you would have to look up the security rules in china
but nonetheless, as you can see, uh, bnb, formerly binance coin, was launched during the initial coin offering
so if you do understand securities laws, that is it in the first sentence, it is a security
if you do want to know about what securities are, and because i know a lot of people in the cryptocurrency markets, um, have no idea what security is
it is pretty complicated, or at least it takes a little bit of explanation
so if you do want to know what security is, head over to my channel, click on playlists, click on view full playlist
most cryptocurrencies are securities, and it will say, crypto, initial coin offerings and securities
we go against, uh, we we talk about all four things that constitutes the securities laws, which, if i recommend, if i remember them off the top of my head, it is an invest it's an investment vehicle
and it's an investment based on the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others
so bnb is a security, but you would have to look at, because it had its initial crane offering in china, so you would need to see if it's an unregistered security based on china's ico laws
so march 1st, china has long banned icos with the first crackdown in the sect in 2017
we need to find out exactly when this was in 2017, because if we look back, where was the ico? uh, we'll get rid of the twitter
let's check out the laws of the security laws over in china in july 2017, 10year sentence
so bnb is an unregistered security, uh, according to chinese initial coin offerings laws
so like i said, if you want to learn more about what an ico is, simply come over to my channel, youtube's, uh, well, you know, this isn't what you'll see
actually, if you come over to my channel, click over on playlist, educational series
and then, once again, it's this first one here, i'll explain everything you need to know about securities
and as you can see, china has, they have cracked down on initial coin offering
and as you can see, that is why the sec is going after them at this moment
the thing is with icos is, 999 of all cryptocurrencies are securities
so you would need to look at specific, uh, countries laws on icos
so for example, i can tell you exactly what the ico rules are in the us
however, i had to google, you know, we had to research this ourselves, what the laws are in china
they are cracking down on initial coin offerings over on cryptocurrencies
this took place before the finance um, but before binance had its ico
unregistered security, should i say? all right, so i'm gonna wrap up the stream in the next five to ten minutes
now, general grievous back in the chat, who voted, bnb ain't a security
uh, i i don't want to go through his every cryptocurrency security where? where did kadena ico? did it have an ico? so it did have a token sale
where is kadena based? uh, it is based in the oh, no, this isn't kadena
so as far as i can tell, kadena is an unregistered security, which is, you know, like i said, i think the sec is going to be cracking down very hard on unregistered securities
so, um, have my elliott waves changed? no, my, my elliott waves haven't moved since i made my last elliott wave update, like, uh, quite a while ago
on the daily time frame, you can see, like i said before, this was your five impulse
and at this moment in time, we are in the five wave of the c correction
so we are in the last wave to the downside, at least according to elliott wave theory
i'm gonna be covering, uh, all of the old cranes tomorrow individually
i'll make separate videos about them with specific price targets
i'll probably be checking out what's going on on the total cryptocurrency market cap, because we're once again, you know, we were predicting this move down from the 618 fib up here at 731 billion, we were predicting basically half of the market to get wiped out as we come down to the 786
and it does look like we are basically lollygagging, chilling out, before we probably do come down to your macro 618, which would wipe out about another 87 billion
i'll probably, i'll probably make an update on the bitcoin dominance
i'll talk about what's going on in the stock market, because the dollar is on a massive bullish rampage
so basically all signals point for lower price targets on both bitcoin the stock market, uh, cryptocurrency market, old cranes, all of that good stuff
the current bitcoin price is twenty thousand nine hundred and thirty dollars
and that trap would essentially be looking for some sort of a scam wick higher
and then most likely i'd be going into a couple of short positions, but we'll cover that shortly
i'm just waiting for this liquidity grab over here before i take any sort of a spot position long
and as i mentioned previously, i'm mostly just kind of waiting to to go along on certain alt coins that i think haven't come down as far as what they could
the risk to reward is not that high, um shorting at the moment
however, there is one coin that i found, which is also going to be mentioned in today's newsletter
if you want a more indepth analysis of that, i am looking and thinking, potentially, to take a short on that trade
and as you can see, the main liquidity zone, it could go quite deep, guys
so anyway, from there, still another maximum of 20 to the downside
i've shown this chart a million times, and that's essentially just focusing on the yellow 21 ema
so i won't focus on this too long, but i want to see that liquidity grab, and then i'd be looking for the mean reversion bounce back up into the underside resistance, which could come anywhere as low as 25 and as high as about the 30, 29, 30k level
and i'm starting to see the rounds on twitter now where guys are starting to compare these fractals
i i prefer to be more forward looking in the market and not look at what has happened historically, although they do merit some sort of validity, something that you can look at and is in the realm of possibilities
so they're essentially showing the s p 500 fractal from uh 2008, 2009 crash
and it's kind of in this falling wedge over there, which breaks to the downside
the lesson that i'm trying to show here is that it's important to trade in line with the trend
so if the trend is down, especially if you're taking leveraged trades, rather focus on looking for leverage shorts, as opposed to going leverage long in this type of environment
um, he's shown here the nastic uh, that it can take quite a while
and essentially what he's looking at on the bottom over here is these this, this blue sort of line that started to form
and he says, quick vshape recoveries can happen more often when the line is orange, which signifies positive money flow
and now the line is actually about to flip blue, which is not a surprise given the current global conditions
and as you can see, once it does go blue, historically that has been 50 weeks, 129 weeks, 45 weeks
and currently we're only looking to close the first week in the blue
and that just brings me back to my point that once bitcoin drops below 20k, when people start to see those teens numbers again, that's when the real panic will set in
and these things can take time, so you kind of just have to remain patient, be very stingy on your orders
i also took the s p 500 here on my own personal chart, and i'll just show you that
long story short, the worst crashes, other than the 1929 crash, which was about 80, but the worst crashes have been in the region of about 50 to the downside
now, if you take top two, currently where we are now, we only about 25
and then again, the real panic would set in when you start to break that, that that white line parabola, which would come in at around 40 percent
uh, at the moment, i won't be looking for major, meaningful wrongs
uh, big spot positions, any spot positions that i'm taking now is probably only going to be about five to ten percent of my available capital
it's very, very important to have good risk management in the current global economic times, uh, and control your position sizes
now, this on a low time frame, is essentially what i'm watching
we haven't been able to capture that for a long period of time
and now you sort of have two scenarios that i see playing out
so any sort of a wick into this area, or even above that 21, i'd most likely look for weakness
if that weakness came and you really want to be aggressive as a trader, then you could take a short position
so what am i seeing is, possibly move into that 21, come back down, then you sort of flip that area into the previous support at 20k, into resistance
and then very, very quickly you'll be followed through with a week to the downside
but the real demand lies, i guess, between about 16 and about 19 k
the other scenario is that you kind of have a range that's forming
so you can draw a line over there, and what would happen then is you would follow this green path over here
so if a range forms, you're essentially buying the bottom of the range, selling the top of the range
any sort of, uh, four hourly closes above that low time frame, key level, which is coming in at 22 900ish dollars, would invalidate that kind of move and say that, okay, we we are truly reversing in the market
okay? now, i would probably take my bids over here off of the table, my lower bids between the 16 and 19k area, if this consolidation continued on for a long period of time
this is what you can expect when you start to see this kind of consolidation
that signifies that a big move is coming and when those big moves come, they generally have a high probability of breaking to the downside, as opposed to the upside, well in line with the trend, which is currently to the downside
so if we were in an up training market, it would be the same thing
let's make this chart big and zoom in, just to show you the inverse of that
when you go straight up, consolidate, consolidate, consolidate
you go sideways for a while, everybody loves it, and then bang, you go straight up again
small pull back, consolidate, consolidate, and then straight back up
look what's happening now, right? so we had the down leg over there, consolidation, which i would say that this area is kind of, let's change it to a white over there
okay? that area is kind of similar to what happened over here
this area over here is kind of similar to what happened over here
and what happened, if you look at this chart over here, is that anybody who went long in these regions, of which i can tell you, there were plenty of people, especially on this, uh, in this one over here
you get the higher high, but what about the higher low? you need to wait for those kind of confirmations
a lot of people went wrong here, and now look, they're completely trapped
so, uh, very important to remain patient and wait for true confirmation of trend changes
now, what's going on right now on bnb, which is on a four hour chart, is very similar to what we previously saw where, so we had the swing low, and then i said that this is going to flip into underside resistance
and we drew this area over here, watching the lower, the lower highs, and price continuing to distribute
and i said, look to grab any of this liquidity over here into a short position
and then you asked me, am i still in this trade? i said that i closed out all my profits in the first target because this is a liquidity zone where i was thinking that price might have some sort of a big snap back to the upside, where i would have a chance to get back out
you had the attempt to push through failed below key invalidation level
is coming in at 2372 dollars, which has got the big blue mark over there
any sort of wicks into this yellow area over here, which is going to range between 222, and i call it to invalidation at 237
you could technically enter a short position targeting the second target at 1415
anywhere between, depending on where you close your profit, 35 to 45, huge move
again, i've said many times before, i am looking for altcoins to still take another 30 leg down before final capitulation takes place
i would actually love to go through a lot more stuff, but for that, you'll need to follow me on twitter, which, if you look in the link below in the description, you'll find over there, my twitter, my instagram
there is also a private link for those of you who are looking to follow along with these trades and you get value from this

i don't always go live at exactly the same time, so then you'll receive a notification when i do
i will see you all for the next video, which is coming up on monday
for now, this crypto shorts video is proudly brought to you by unix gaming, the leading web 3 gaming ecosystem
not only a worldwide gaming community, unix is a launch pad, a gaming studio and a tekken content creator that serves the bridge between web 2 and wave 3
uh, as we enter the weekend, and what some of you might not know, because we're an international community here, um, monday is a public or bank holiday in the united states
so we might actually see a little bit of a quieter day on monday
yeah, i mean, i am really only waiting here for a breakout below the wave b of this triangle
and that is really everything we need to we need to do, because then we can finally enter this last wave down of this correction this way five
and to be honest, everything's pointing towards that at the moment, which doesn't mean it's guaranteed, but it's just high confidence at the moment
i mean, as i'm counting this currently as an abcde triangle, which normally would suggest opposite of the wave e, you're going out of the triangle
however, it's unfortunately not always that easy, because this could just extend, and then we have to move the wave c over, for example, and the wave d, and it will just become a longer triangle, similar to to that one here, which become, became quite a long triangle as well
and against the 31 21 334 level, i would expect the move down
yeah, invalidation would he only occur really above, really above thousand two hundred ninety five, yeah
here, we've got a resistance level at twenty one thousand three hundred and thirty four
and, yeah, it would be nice to just move down from here and finish this correction off
and again, the breakout level would be the wave b low at 20 000
um, yeah, 100 or something, isn't it? so that would be, um, what we need, and what would be the target level
so there are a few ways, a few ways, um, how we can actually measure this
um, so we've got obviously the seventy eight point six percent fib level, that is at sixteen thousand nine hundred dollars
and another target would just purely be here, the widest, the widest space in this triangle
so let's do it here, roughly this one, and we added to a potential breakout point
and that would take us down to round about 17 830, you know, depending on when the breakout will occur, maybe even a bit lower, 17650
so to be honest, there are a couple of couple of possible scenarios
and that was based on, i think it was the um, it was the multiple, uh, it was a multiple of a wave one, i believe
but yet, this is sort of anywhere really, as long as we are making a lower low below the wave um three here
okay, below the wave b, let's say below the wave b here, twenty thousand one hundred
and there are a couple of target levels, but really, does it really matter that much? as long as we now make another lower low, and ideally we stay above the 786 fibonacci retracement level and reverse from here
but the longer this here takes, um, the more unlikely it gets
so, and also, a breakout to the downside would then become more likely
and bear in mind, this is another way for, so we we love wave fours on this channel
this was a way for as well, starting in may, basically until, um, middle of june
and a potential bullish scenario, i would not consider until we break out above 23 295
reason for that, the triangle is also a trend continuation pattern, and we would just repeat what we did here, basically, when we climbed down here on the 12th of may
but i believe, in contrast to many other people, that we're very close to the low
and i told you already in the beginning of december that we will go down to below 286 k
so it is always making sure we don't believe, necessarily, what everybody believes, but because this is rarely what's actually going to to happen
so this is pretty much what we can say here as we enter the weekend
there isn't much more to point out, what i didn't say in the previous videos
and, i mean, it could be, you know, that we've already done our wave one
to the downside here, that we have made a small wave one of this impulsive wave down
and then we could come somewhere here in this region, below 20k, or between 20k and the 786 percent flip level f of 169 k
but really, what we are waiting for is just that move below 201 k
already, a move below here, this swing low at 203 k would already indicate that it's probably over, um

and if you really like content, check out the channel membership
you know, we had quite a lot of volatile days now, um, but you know, it is all moving currently within the line, within the lines of the expectations that i outlined in the previous video and videos
you know, we talked about here two days ago, already, about this potential triangle which might be forming here for the wave four
and, um, we can see here, we can count a wave a, we can count a wave b, we can count the wave c, we can count wave d
and when we came down here, i told you that we probably see a small rally to the upside in a wave e, which is what we currently can see
i mean, don't get me wrong, this triangle can still be invalidated if we go above the wave a high, which is at twenty three thousand three hundred dollars
but for now, it is pretty much adhering very well to the forecast here
and the reason for that is that, um, the right, we came down in the wave d
that doesn't necessarily need to be a super long wave, but what you would normally expect here in such a wave e is three wave move an, a, a, b and a c
we currently have no indication that it is over yet, but we can already count three waves
now, especially as we came to that previous um here, there's a bit of a resistance in this zone where we currently currently are
yeah, we had a bit of resistance here, here, here, and now again
if we now see, let's say, a bearish engulfing candle or something like that, and we break below this um moving average here on the one hour chart, that could already push us down below the triangle
and what would be important to break out of the triangle to the downside is um, to get the the validation, yeah, that this was a triangle and that we actually breaking down here
and a good indication that that wave four is over, yeah, because the wave four is always ending at the end of the triangle um
and that we are going to break out to the triangle to the downside would be a good indication would be a move below the wave d low at twenty thousand two hundred and forty dollars
but even better, and actually confirmation, would be if we break below the wave b low, which is below twenty thousand one hundred dollars, pretty much
so we wanna move below the wave below to really get confirmation that this wave e is over
the wave e can extend further, absolutely it can, and i think it will, if we manage to get above the previous swing high here of the wave e, which is at 21 334
so if you see that breaking, i think then we can move all the way up to the a c line here, that descending trend line
and if we don't stop here at the trend line, that is not a problem yet for this scenario
and if we go above that, i think that would be a pretty strong indication that this, um, that this triangle is not going to work out, you know
don't get me wrong, this triangle can still extend out further
if we get new price information in, we might have to move them around
we had this situation before where, um, i had to move the wave d over here, for example, yeah
and until we have a breakout, um, bear in mind that triangles themselves are very hard to trade, because they can move shape
but here you have very clear support and resistance lines defined, but they can extend out
and for me, the probabilities are that the breakout goes to the downside of this triangle
it is the same situation that we had up here in this larger triangle as well, where we had pretty much the same pattern, a, b, c, d, e, in this um, yeah, in this triangle
and i remember that when i um, because we had a few indications here that we were already breaking out to the downside earlier
um, and the wxy pattern and the y wave consisted then of the triangle
so that's what i mean, you know, we had a triangle here in the beginning as well, and it just reformed, reshaped in this way four, and it created a new pattern
and i already had people laughing because, oh, yeah, you always predict the move down
i cannot come, i just cannot come to a different conclusion at the moment, other than that we are going down from here
there is a probability now, and not, you know, certainly a probability that we are going up from here, and that the low is already in for bitcoin, but it is fairly small
and until i see evidence, why would i go with it? you know, until i see a breakout, at least above the 23 300 and i'm talking here about a huge move up here, above that, and something that is very impulsive, something that is very bullish with volume behind it, you know, then we can be more confident that the low has already been in
and don't get me wrong, even with this wave count, we could possibly construct a wave count that would allow the load to be in
for example, we could count this currently as a one, two, so we couldn't count here wave one, here, wave two
but this would be the moment where we know now would need to come up, and very impulsively, would need to break out above the twenty three thousand three hundred dollar level
and if we see a five wave move, which is quite clear, then we can be quite certain that the low for bitcoin was in
but, um, until we see that confirmation, we cannot just make a guess and and go with it
we want to have evidence, you know, hope and hopium, as you will find it on many other channels, and generally in the crypto space
um, we want to have the probabilities on our side, and we want to apply logic
you know, it's not, it's like, um, don't panic when the price doesn't suddenly starts to move up
we want to always wait for confirmation, ideally to understand trend reversal
because if you just speculate the trend remains, reversal might not have happened
you wait for a train, and if you miss the train, then you won't run after the train, right? you will
and especially in the beginning of an uptrend, there will be quite strong dips
all of this indicates that we are really, really close to the low
it can mean, certainly, as i expected, that we will make one more low
for example, a key level that would be suitable would be the 17k level, or more precise, the 169 k level, which is the 786 fibonacci retracement level of this overall move down of bitcoin
and a move down to that next fib level here at 169 k, would certainly allow for support and would allow for the price to have another opportunity to turn around, if it doesn't manage to do it within the 20k area
don't get me wrong, turning around in the 20k area would be amazing, and it would actually perfectly fulfill my primary expectation from back in november december, when i told you that in the range between 20 and 286 k, i expect the reversal
yeah, but even in the current scenario of a wave 2, we certainly can go lower
you know, i don't have a problem with breaking the 20k level, because i made that forecast seven months ago
and i even told you that the current elliott wave count, also the larger scale elliott wave count, allows for a move down all the way to 106 k
yeah, um, it would be a lot of, much more downside for bitcoin from the current price
and and here you get just to the limits of what such a forecast can give you, because we now just, we are in the area where we can say, all right, bitcoin has fulfilled all the requirements for this correction
we just now need to wait for the reversal and to understand if the low is really in
and we cannot call the bottom, right? we can't call it, because we want to wait for confirmation, okay? and then we can call it

[Music] yo, what's up, my crypto legends? let's dive in, straight into the charts
let's analyze the situation with bitcoin, and also we're going to take a look at oil and natural gas
it's one of the only markets that i'm trading, uh, for the moment, apart from bitcoin, and absolutely doing phenomenal gains on those markets
how is everyone doing guys? make sure to smash up that like button
stop loss here is below the 20 000 range, round about the nineteen point eight
i do expect some kind of relief rally um to the upside, before potentially some continuation to the downside
but, of course, let me just say hello here in the comment section right away
i was very much expecting this kind of correction for oil and also for natural gas
uh, i've been buying, you know, oil and natural gas for the last few days
i want to share with what, i want to share with you what i am doing, of course
make sure to enjoy your friday, disconnect from the charts a little bit and have a fantastic weekend
but today, friday, this live stream was just going to be 20 minutes
i'm going to say hello to the to the community and go through what i think i can see here on bitcoin
and i'll just take a look at oil and natural gas, if you wish, because that is the only markets that i'm trading at this moment
um, hey, andy, do you trade alts or mainly bitcoin? i mainly trade bitcoin
s p i'm right now just eyeing on oil and natural gas, uh, for the moment
i've left s p 500 on the sides for for a while, because i don't like to have, you know, five, six, ten trades open, maybe two, three from different markets
not much, because of not, it's just gonna, um, yeah, it's just too much of a headache, uh, to have many markets
uh, just with one or two or even three is more than enough to make some really good gains
i mean, for the private competition, i'm gonna be looking at two all coins
but i'll be focusing on two for looking for the levels and major opportunities, and bitcoin and ethereum
i want to, i want to focus on on full analysis for the trading opportunities
uh, what's up? my crypto legend says, monks labs, how are you? i know
uh, mark dutch, how are you doing? thank you for joining the live stream
make sure to ask a question when you are giving me a super chat
hey, andy, do you think we are about to fall down because we are crabbing at that 20k level and no bounce in sight? well, let me just take a look at bitcoin
i mean, we could be just crumbling down here, because at the end of the day, we are in a downtrend
okay? i am in a long position, but remember, i am fighting the trend at this moment
these are not the best, you know, trading opportunities, because you're basically trying to find the bottom
you're trying to fight the trend, which is very aggressively to the downside
this is why i can have tight stop losses, right? i got a tight stop losses
but if we do break down the zone, okay, and start getting this volatility and start making a swing failure pattern, then, yeah, i will be very much interested for for longing again for a potential bigger relief rally
um, so, because, you know, you can get stopped out many times if you do have tight stop losses from your entry point
you can get stopped out till you get that big, massive trade that is five stops, five or six times your stop loss
so, yeah, this is the thing, risk management, number one key here for trading
no doubt in my mind, you can be the best technical analyst guy you will and have zero risk management
you will not know how to make money, even though you you are an expert in in technical analysis
there is full of experts on twitter, not but there are a lot of them that, um, seem to to think they are expert in, experts in technical analysis
and, um, yeah, i bet a lot of them are not successful traders because they have very poor risk management
i see many youtubers having these huge trades of, you know, twenty thousand, fifty thousand, one hundred thousand dollar trades
i mean, and a lot of them do get liquidated and burnt out, uh
where is the level that we could bounce if we do lose this 20 000 range? okay, one strong, major support level where we could get a big, big bounce is exactly the 19 400
if we do start dropping below twenty thousand dollars and we have a big, massive move to the downside, be prepared for a potential, large bounce at nineteen thousand four hundred dollars
why should we? why should we prepare for a big bounce at nineteen thousand four 400? well, if i zoom out here on the daily guys, i just want to show you right away that this has been a major, major resistance zone right here
i'm not sure if you guys, if a lot of you entered in 2021, 2022, i remember seeing bitcoin
this is actually the moment where i start, stopped accumulating bitcoin
this was the moment the, this is what was my last accumulation area from bitcoin, wit, from the bull run
ready for that breakout, ready for the breakout of alltime highs
let me just take take a look at another chart here one second
let me just zoom out here a little bit on the daily basically, this is what we got
round about that, nineteen thousand four hundred dollars on the bit stamp chart
okay, we have that daily close, daily close exactly at the nineteen thousand
nineteen thousand, uh, the close is at nineteen thousand one hundred and eighty seven on the bit stamp chart
this level is very, very likely going to get some kind of reaction, some kind of bounce
okay, so expect some volatility and a big bounce from this range
i'm talking about that 191, 198, approximately between those levels, in between 19 000 and 19 800
very likely you might have a spike down, have a little bit of volatility at that range
so, uh, so, yeah, let's take a look at um bitcoin in the immediate short term
like take a look at some, some levels here and and take a look at the comment section most importantly, uh, one of the reasons why i do think that we could get that, you know, small relief rally, another relief rally to the upside, you know, because we are creating aggressive low highs
if you are long in bitcoin, you know, from this range, you're basically fighting the trend
so the the risk in actually getting stopped out here this is, you know, this is not the highest probable trade at this moment
i felt like taking this risky trade here, trading at the twenty thousand, uh, seven hundred, twenty thousand eight hundred dollar range, you know, for that potential relief rally um on bitcoin, you know, at least hitting round about that, 218k levels
you could see, you can see the kind of price action in the immediate short term
let me just go to the 30 minute chart, right? this does look really bearish
this does look like it's just gonna collapse, um, but we can also see a kind of, kind of inverse head and shoulder
of course, if we start dropping from this level, it will be invalidated
but we have this kind of movement, this kind of movement now we we're consolidating at this range, so we can actually pick up, if we do break this resistance trend line, then we'll have that move up very, very lightly to that 218, um k levels
and i wanted to explain here one second about oil and natural gas
okay, just a quick overview on oil and natural gas, because i'm in in bigger, i have more gains, actually, on primax bt then on bitcoin
but on primex bt, i've been trading, you know, oil and natural gas and, and the reason why i i did short this, and i, i, i did explain this in one of my videos a few weeks ago, that this was, you know, very likely going to be a distribution event, right where the smart money is actually leaving at these spikes
and a big, major correction is very, very likely on oil, on natural gas, sorry, potentially coming all the way down and even dipping below the 650
i'll be closing my position here on primex bt um on on natural gas
okay, since the conflict, all right, in eastern europe, this was the moment that happened, all right, conflict in eastern europe, this is when the price goes absolutely, you know, absolutely bananas, skyrocketing, going up more than 100 in price
and then, you know, of course, people are extremely, feel fearful
people think that prices are going to go much, much higher, uh? but, you know, p you need to think that prices are going to go higher just at the start of the conflict, not when it's already happened
and when you make these kind of, you know, when you make this kind of price action on the chart, it means that the smart money is already leaving the market at these peaks
okay? and, you know, this is the whole reason why i actually entered a short position
i mean, this one's on oil, just at the top of this peak right now, position is protected
but on natural gas, you know, entering also, you know, this major, major halfway zone level
all right, seeing the exhaustion, getting into that six, one, eight level bounce over here
i had three entries, and the average m3 is at the six, dollar, seven, eight, 870, approximately, waiting for that big, major drop down as as a kind of a perfect distribution event here on on um, on natural gas, this is what you see
you see the first drop over here, getting below the lows, and then a low or high, and then you get the big, massive drop
so, you know, pretty happy with that trade on on oil, i mean, on natural gas and also on oil
the the good thing about oil is that we were creating a massive, big swing failure pattern on the monthly chart
we actually gained the highs from 2011 and closed a big, massive monthly, um, a big, massive monthly candle
now, does this mean you're going to actually come down straight away? absolutely not
you're going to, very likely going to claim these highs and then get the drop
you you have the swing failure pattern coming straight back down, consolidation, and then you are going to have the big, major drop
i do see oil coming back to, you know, 190, even 80 dollars in the next couple of months
people cannot afford, you know, demand is gonna go down because, you know, oil prices are absolutely skyrocketing
um, you know, if you go to the if you're going to put some gas in your, in your car, you know, you know, it's, it's extremely expensive
so is it going to go to much, much higher levels in the coming weeks? no, it's very likely going to have a correction
so, you know, i do think that, um, the price of, um, of oil is going to come at least to 100, uh, potentially 90 in in the next coming, you know, weeks, couple of months
and natural gas also, i'm looking, am i in for that 656 range? and of course, i am bullish in the long term
you know, i think by september, october, we'll be, you know, actually continuing back up
that correction is inevitable to happen here on on oil and natural gas, before we might see some, some more bullish momentum by the end of the year
this is why i was in the shorts, because of the swing failure, monthly pattern, swing swing failure on the monthly on oil, and this distribution event here on on natural gas, where smart money is leaving
you know, the market at these peaks, even though you're in an uptrend, this uptrend is getting exhausted
but i am eyeing for that potential 21 800 for my first take profit
and potentially maybe even going as high as twenty two thousand eight hundred dollars, um
when we have such a severe drop like this, i know a lot of people are are thinking that we are going to go to much, much lower levels in the coming weeks
i think we need a little bit of range trading before we actually continue to the downside
and i do see us range trading right between, you know, potentially twenty three, twenty four thousand dollars, maybe claim this high and and the low twenty thousand dollar range
you know, i think it's very, very possible that we could claim these these levels and range trade here for a little bit before we continue back down
if we do drip dip down 20 000, i do not think it's going to be a successful breakout
we could potentially be retesting the low 90 000 range, and then get the pump
i don't see a big, massive capitulation, you know, down to, you know, sixteen, fourteen thousand dollars, uh, anytime soon for the for the coming weeks
i mean, trades can fail, but if you are protected with stop losses, of course, then you do not fail
i'm actually in a hurry because i'm going out for dinner, guys
i mean, depending on where you are, where you live, you know, you might be going for breakfast, dinner, lunch, or you might be going to bed
i'll be doing a longer live stream tomorrow, taking a look at the situation where we could find some, some, uh, good opportunities
and, um, yeah, let's just, let's take a look at some some altcoin
we got tara luna 20, and i think that one's absolutely collapsed
came out, you know, five dollars, went to ten dollars, currently at two dollars
what's that? what's the current luna doing? uh, it's not even here
now, this is the, this is what you call an absolute dead project
um, all depending on and what, you know, if you are looking for make it out, uh, for me to analyze for the mid long term, we are actually at the extreme, you know, lowest levels that we could be, in my opinion, because, uh, we were consolidating here for a long, long time
you know, 2018, 2019, 2020, this is very likely going to find a bottom at these levels
and i do strongly believe that a lot of d5 projects are going to absolutely succeed in the next coming years
um, so, yeah, guys, um, this is gonna, i'm just, it was just a quick update
uh, do do you trade ethereum, yes, but not very much, not very much
i basically trade, uh, more bitcoin, more bitcoin than ethereum, guys, this is going to be it for the stream
remember, if you want to trade, you know, oil, natural gas, or any other markets, primix, bt is the number one place to go, as you can use bitcoin as collateral
and all of this, you know, once i close this, uh, this trade, you know that bitcoin is going to go to my cold wallet, because this is how, you know, i'm also going to accumulate bitcoin by by using primax bt, and, you know, trading other markets
and i also get a small commission also with the affiliate link, to help out the channel
make sure to join the buybit team for the competition down below
from the 27th of june till the 17th of july is going to be full on, by bit, full on these cryptos
okay, bitcoin, ethereum, and i'm going to choose two all coins
we'll be sharing analysis in the telegram group for the people that have joined the team
i will be not be to maybe take a look at the s p 500 or or dxy, just to see, you know, where we could potentially go with it with bitcoin and crypto
might be holding the twenty thousand dollars for that potential relief rally
what is going on? my crypto legends, right? let me just set up here
let me just quickly set up, because i should be live right now
how's everyone doing? let me just make sure to smash up the like button for this new stream
what's going on with my internet? i'm going to be it's absolutely crazy
where should i move? what country? where can i move? guys? let me know in the comment section
i'm just going to pass us the the link here to the community right away
okay, despite bitcoin, we can take a look at bitcoin afterwards
mark dutch, shall i go to the netherlands? nigeria, malaysia, india, indonesia
eagles, he got had a huge, massive correction, like everything else
what are our major label levels here for egold? let's take a look at the threeday chart
eagle was in a very nice range here, kind of a bear flag, ascending triangle, pennant, whatever
okay, we couldn't get all of these small levels from analysis from back of the summer of 2021
i remember right over here when we were having this big, major pump, eagles is the future
i remember very much people going absolutely crazy when we saw eagle going from 300 all the way up here to almost 600 in a matter of, you know, less than a week
let's just zoom out here on egold, check out what is going on, because it looks pretty good
we are some very, very strong levels that could be holding in the immediate short term
what levels are these? this is exactly, you know, this forty, 40 range
of course, we do have much stronger vpv all the way down here
but if we take a look at the volume traded range on egold, we're starting to have big, big levels
there's hardly any volume here, because there's so much demand spreaded that the price just is easy to absolutely, you know, fly, because there is a lot of demand, but there's not a huge amount of volume, right? spreaded
there is bigger volume at thirty dollars on egold then actually, you know, from forty dollars all the way up to four hundred, five hundred dollars, there's bigger volume down here
so, you know what? what? what the volume profile tells you, this is basically a sustainable price, because it has a lot, a lot of volume at that level
so i do see eagle potentially even hitting 30 dollars, and that would be a nice level for a large consolidation, if you were, if we are looking for for accumulation levels
as soon as eagle maybe hits around about thirty dollars, fifty dollars, thirty dollars, twenty five, you know, forty dollars, and starts consolidating at this level for the next coming months, that will be very much likely, the the low levels, the levels where you need to accumulate
okay? if we are looking for a longterm position on egold investment, um, we are looking for that consolidation
and this could actually be in between around about 25 and 50 dollar range, okay? it could happen
but i would wait for sideways action, because the the downtrend could actually continue
so wait for the sideways action, of course, for the next coming months, and then, and then, you know, buy up
let's take a look at the immediate, shortterm analysis on egold
we were in a very, very aggressive trend at the moment, still with eagles
so what are the major resistance levels where we could potentially take a short on egold? well, we can see it right over here
there's a big, major level from the volume traded for the last month
this is going all the way back here to late april, right? so we can see from the volume traded the last 30, 40 days, the biggest point of control is right over here at 6967, 67, 68, approximately round that range where we do have a nice, big spike on the vpvr
we're having this kind of relief rally in the immediate short term on egold
if we do start hitting those levels in the next coming days, 68 can be a very, very strong resistance level where the price could consolidate and get heavily rejection for continuation to the downside
if we do get that big relief rally, if we do pump about 13 14 in the next few days on egold, it's very likely going to be a rejection level
you can see here on the chart, on the 12th of may, on the 27th of may, where that level has been very much respected, you are in a very aggressive downtrend here, as you can see
we've also can take fibonacci retracement from this high, this big, massive pump
and we could be taking a look at 50, 50 618, which would be in between sixty two five and sixty eight point four on e gold
this zone over here is extremely, extremely probable that it will be getting a rejection
huge downtrend, as you can see, very, very big downtrend with the lower highs
big, major level that has been respected as support selling pressure continuation
very likely that if we do hit these levels, we will be very likely going to get a rejection here on egold at that level
okay, now your question might be, i i'm going to put an alarm here just in case i, i do get that signal when, um, and i do want to short this, because this can be shorted on on by bit, if i'm not mistaken
uh, has added a huge amount of altcoins the last, uh, few weeks
it's another way to support the channel, because i do get a commission
um, of course, there are more platforms, but the one that i got very good bonuses is is these two, which are down below in the description
also, if you are interested, only for people that are interested, only people that are experienced, or that all do have good risk management
how is litecoin looking to you? says, uh, manatee, let's take a look
if it does manage to have that leg up to that 64, 68, getting a consolidation around that range, it will be looking very nice for a potential short
litecoin does follow bitcoin most of the time, but it has much aggressive moves, to the downside, of course, and to the upside
um, litecoin actually is very, very close to the lows of the of um, the c19 crash, right? the crash that we had in march of 2020
let me just have a clean out of this chart right over here from some trend lines that i had from the past
major level that was lost here on on litecoin, which is the 100 um
we are basically, you know, i think litecoin is going to be one of those that will survive
um, it's like the silver, right? litecoin was known as the silver digital silver
will litecoin survive? will litecoin die? i don't think it will die and stay close to zero
i just think it's gonna gonna take some some time, and it will survive
we are trading at those levels right now, where we do have the largest spike on the vpvr
all right? so, you know, i, i, i personally think, with experience from last cycles, if you accumulate, you accumulate at these levels, you you will be very likely doing a 10x on your on your investment
i think this was what i do think, um, and basically, you know, no matter how long it takes, it might take two years, it might take five years, this is very likely, at some point in the future, gonna come back up and retest the alltime high
and probably next time it's probably gonna even break it successfully
like i said, usually when you have these hypes, you do take a long time off for a large consolidation
so immediate, short term, litecoin all depending on what bitcoin does, or depending on what bitcoin does, we've already got a pretty nice, pretty nice um rejection from this major level
i think we can break it and even come up and retest these higher levels, the 60 range
this is, of course, if bitcoin does manage to behave, does manage to have a large relief rally to 24 25 k
you know, it's very likely that litecoin will be breaking this resistant zone at 51
if we do break this 51 level, um, a rejection point can be the 61, 60, 61 level, strong resistance here on litecoin
these are the major levels that you need to take advantage from because, you know, i'm not going to tell you what the price is going to do, because i don't know
whoever says, you know, the price is going here or the price is going there, run away, because he's absolutely lying
we can take a look at the levels that we can bounce as support and resistance and take advantage of that balance
you can look at the highest probability scenario, just like here, right here we have a lovely descending triangle, right? absolutely phenomenal descending triangle
you could speculate okay, with these lower highs that you are going to break finally the support level and come to much lower levels
um, looking at the highest probability zone, of course, right now, you know, right now on litecoin, you know, if bitcoin does behave, if bitcoin does behave, we are an aggressive downtrend
but for the moment, we are creating a resistance level at the 50 range
so, you know, who, who knows, you might be actually breaking this resistant zone and having a larger relief rally
and this is a big, big support level that will be acting as resistance
we need to go level to level, right? so, um, depending on how bitcoin, um, how bitcoin is going to to behave, we are looking for, you know, that relief rally, then litecoin could potentially get that big, larger relief rally before continuation to the downside
i want to try and get into this shorts at these larger relief rallies, you know, try and short these levels
andy, can ada hit 10 cent during this bear market? says, abdel, absolutely
um, uh, andy, can you take a look at theta, please? says, half
let's first take a look at, uh, which one was it? let's first take a look at ada, ada, and then theta
this 510 level was the extreme low levels here from 2018 and 2019
this is why we did have this big, large, you know, vpvr level, the highest point on this vpvr is the 10 cent level
um, if we do manage, if ada does manage already to go sideways for several months, in the next coming months, above the 30 cent level, then, yeah, this is very likely going to be a low range
if ada does go sideways for quite a long time above 30 cents, uh
if we see bitcoin losing 20k and going much lower, a lot of the old coins will get destroyed
ada is one of those blockchain projects that will very likely survive in the next run
it is a, i think it will be a survivor, just like what happened here, you know, ada massive survivor in the bear market of 2018, 2019, 2020
you know, you do have some, some projects built up on ada, very good
question is, where is the low levels? like you said, can we go to 10 cents? yes
so the best um how to detect a bottom, basically, is when you actually going to go sideways for quite some time
we have a nice consolidation here in between 25 cents and 40 cents
you may might get that dip down to 30 cents, 25 cents, one more time and you might start having some relief rallies, slightly sideways action, this kind of momentum for the next coming months
and that is when you are going to know that we are bottoming out
so this is the thing, you know, we need a little bit more sideways action
once you go sideways for quite several months, is where you can detect a potential bottom
this is just a cons small consolidation from a big, massive drop that we had here in may
radia is one of them that i do not like to do technical analysis because it has a lot of spikes and a lot to the upside into the downside
um, i really remember seeing this project, you know, around about the 10 cent level for a long, long time
um, i didn't buy one single theta, even though i was bullish on this project
the moment, you know, if we take a look at the long perspective for the next, you know, six to 24 months, we need to see that kind of big, large sideways action
then is the moment that we are, we will be entering accumulation zone
if we want to take a look at some potential low levels, we have it right over here
i actually got an alarm set here on theta around about 80 cents
we had a large consolidation back in september, october, november, even part of december of 2020
just below here, 80 cents, we start to have a large spike on the vpvr
okay? i don't, i don't see theta dropping much, much lower, you know, from this, from this level
so 80 cents is already starting to be very, very nice levels to buy here on on theta
where can we see those relief rallies on theta? we can see them around about the 230, 240, if theta comes all the way up to the 230 range, where it was a strong resistance here back in january
i think it's very likely going to get rejected from the zone level to level
we had a little bit of volatility here, but then continued back down
uh, we have the one of the largest spikes on the vpvr right over here
it's not the largest, but it is one of the largest from the volume traded from 2021 in 2022, you can see the spike there
so if it does come up to this level, 210, 220, it would be almost 100 pump
if we do go up there, it would be, it would be time to be bearish
because when you, when you're in a big, massive bear market, you retest the lows many, many times
you know, you have those relief rallies, uh, where people get excited, but you come back down and retest the lows
relief rallies retest the lows, relief rallies retest the lows again
and that is, you know, where you have the the sign of of the potential bottom on a crypto project, you know, for for many, many months before you finally, you know, start having that huge, massive height momentum
so all of these relief rallies are just going to be an opportunity to short, in my opinion, because we are just going to get into a large, large consolidation
of course, if we take a look at data here on the two hourly zoom in, we are basically just range trading at this moment
if we claim the highs and consolidate at this level, it will be very likely gonna going to get rejected back down, uh, other side on theta
if we come down to claim this one dollar level and have that, you know, consolidation, it's very possible that we're gonna get that bounce back up
we're probably going to range trained for another few weeks here, inside of this level on on theta
of course, if you do get that solid breakout here in the immediate short term, you do have a quick trading opportunity at this level
what level? the 150 cents? you know, this is the thing, this is why you need to have your alarm set off
um, you can, you know, inside of this level, it's very, very hard to trade
you can speculate that you might reclaim the highs right now, but you can actually roll, roll back down to retest the lows right away
so it's better to trade the highs or the lows instead of the middle of the range, because the middle of the range, you know, you might think this one's going to come up here, and it comes back down
the middle of the range is very, very hard to trade, or to be trading the the ranges
uh, the all coins now looking a little bit, a little bit crazy
let's take a look at, um, this crypto let's take a look at doge i'm just going through the comment section
are you like me and you forgot to smash the like button? are you like me and forgot to like their smash
are you like me? says, smash on, and you forgot to smash up the like button? guys, absolutely
let's take a look at, um, so just crush that like button on your way in if you forgot
what about dogecoin? i mean, dogecoin is still in a very, very aggressive downtrend
you know, look at dogecoin all the way back here in 20 oh, i mean, the cycle that dogecoin has had has been absolutely crazy
you know, the the alltime high was he around about once, almost two cents
you get those relief rallies, but you get a large, large sideways action
i think dogecoin could even come back down to around about the one two cent level
um, yeah, definitely, definitely on our way to claim the 45 level, which is the lows here created in march of 2021
uh? and and even breaking that range, we can easily retest the 2018 alltime highs
i do see dogecoin trading, you know, in between two, two cents and four cents, losing the lower
if you notice, if you notice here on the dogecoin chart, we are still aggressively in a big, massive downtrend
you know, any relief rally punks that we do have on doge, i'm just gonna say, it is time to short this bad boy
because until we do not have multimonthly massive sideways action, the lows are always going to be claimed
that lows are always going to be claimed in a bear market, in a sideways action market, in an accumulation market, the lows are always going to be claimed
what do i mean? as in, the lows are always going to be claimed? i mean this, i'm in this over here
that lows are always going to be claimed, no matter what, no matter what kind of relief rally, relief pump that you do have, the lows are always going to be claimed, until you have, you know, this was march of 2020
a lot of altcoins didn't retest these lows, like dogecoin, as you can see
but range trading to the lows is just going to happen for many, many months
and all of these relief rallies hitting major resistance levels are very, very likely going to get rejected to continue to retest the lows and even break the lows, till we actually find a major, major bottom
so if we do get a relief rally on dogecoin to round about, roundabout, you know, this this, this high can be claimed
you can't see, it doesn't respect very much the the lows and and the lows and highs
look how we dipped below this major level, came back up, dipped above this major level
okay, this volatile pumps and and dumps, you make, you can make huge coins, huge gains, sorry, huge gains, because it's, um, it moves such a huge amount of percentage
so, you know, these levels over here, i do think it can get above this level, dogecoin, it can get above we are probably creating some aggressive bullish divergence where we are having lower lows on the price action
you know, i do not need to bring the rsi out to know that we are likely creating bullish divergence
we actually not at this moment, but, um, yeah, it's very, very likely going to have larger relief rallies, um, just like we've had here, right? because at this moment we are the, we at the very, very lows
so dogecoin, if dogecoin does manage to claim 8 cents, or even about 10 cents, this is going to be a huge shorting level
you got this resistance support level, you have this zone over here
so once you have that volatility above this level, it's going to be a shorting range
if it does manage to hit that level, of course, i would be stepping in
of course, the question is, are we going to reach there? are we going to reach that level? that would be the 50, the 11 cent range between nine cent and 11 cents would be already a good zone to short if we consolidate there
of course, you might think, oh, because you said that we're going up there
we can long this range, right? no, we couldn't continue down from this level
let's continue the trend, like i said, because the lows are very likely going to be claimed for many, many months and even break them
are we gonna rally in btc, or retest the 20 500, i think rally
this is mentioned on yesterday's live stream, on on on on today
i'm sticking to, you know what, what i said yesterday and today, even though we actually dip below slightly here, i didn't get stopped out, slightly negative
still thinking that we are going to range trade on bitcoin for for a few weeks, at least, range trading for a few weeks
because what happens when we do slightly slow down here for the last few days, is that you claim the highs and you claim the lows, and then you claim the highs again
and then here, after a couple of weeks, is when you realize, why don't i long the lows and short the highs? and this is when you, you you actually um realize this
you know, i'm not saying that this is going to be the scenario
this is very likely to be the scenario after such an aggressive drop that we've just had, you know, um, you know, first week and second week of june, second week of june
uh, losing 30, 35 of of its value in in just about, you know, six, six days or seven days, is a, is a lot
so this is why consolidation, range trading is the most likely scenario
and if you are hitting the lows from this range, the highest probability is claiming the high of the range
but approximately, we've got a daily level, we've got a big resistance zone, claiming the highs there
so having this price action and rolling down from here would be, would be strange
um, are you suggesting an altcoin season for two, three weeks? says koran, range trading can be done on by bits? yes, it can
let's take a look at the bitcoin dominance, because i got someone here
am i suggesting an altcoin season for two, three weeks? uh, no, not an altcoin season
this is why i think some, some all coins are surviving pretty much this
we've having, we having, the bitcoin dominance having a pretty large correction
it just had a little bit of volatility, you know, you know, this, this, these highs over here, this is why i got this box
we were expecting that, you know, not relief rally, or or the awkwards to stop dropping because of the bitcoin dominance
at this level, it looks, it did look like that we were going to break above it, the 48 cents, 48, sorry, 48
um, all the way down to to this, to the 45 percent, which is about six percent drop
this is why, potentially, some all coins are managing to hold the range, having some relief rallies, while bitcoin is going sideways
people prefer having, you know, if you are invested in in cryptocurrency, most of the people prefer having bitcoin
i actually, i am actually accumulating bitcoin and ethereum, and i'm not accumulating alt coins at this moment because i do see bitcoin dominance going higher and all coins bleeding
of course, if we do reach around about the 54, 55 level, uh, on the bitcoin dominance, this is where i'm going to start accumulating, accumulating all coins
this might be in the next three months, six months, 12 months, until we reach to those levels, it's going to take quite some time
but it is the level where, you know, all coins will be bleeding
a lot more bitcoins probably going to going to go sideways, or even lower
and that would be a huge opportunity to get into good altcoin projects
uh, in the next coming months, i do see higher, i do see bitcoin dominance going higher
very likely that this uptrend will continue in the next coming months
the price is approaching the point of control from the volume, from this range
it is at the the biggest point of control is right over here, where we are training at this moment
i'm still sticking to, um, what i uh, to my thoughts, at least to the 218
why? because it's, uh, the 618 level from this drop is now it's the 219
but around that range, 50, 216 219, we could get rejected from this range and continue down, or we could either come and claim the 227
of course, you can take advantage of this level if you're longing from this range, if you are managing your risk, if you will protect your position once you hit this level
um, if you will take profits, not get greedy and leave your stoploss here at the same place, because then you might roll down and get stopped out, and you were in good gains
this is why you can make money even though you're not 100 right with your technical analysis
will i lose money if we, if we go up there and roll down? no, i won't
i take profits quick i protect my position once we have some some some momentum
um, what was your stoploss in the btc, long behind these lows, behind the lows here, created right there
um, yeah, around about 19 900 is my stoploss, below the lows, just below the lows
the reason why is because of this massive candle, massive volatility, and also this kind of price action, right? if you are going to lose these lows, you are not going, you you're not forming this kind of reversal scenario anymore, right? if you lose these lows, you're not forming the reversal scenario
you only have it when you're doing this, right? you you're breaking the, you're breaking the descending weight
of course, what i like to explain many, many times is when you break a resistance or a support trend line, it doesn't mean you're going to create a higher low instantly and you're going to go up
you are very, very likely going to come down and retest maybe the trend line, and even lose the lows, or or a double bottom, or something like that
we broke this major resistance trend line, support trend line
right? we had a major trend line here with higher lows consolidated
and we talked about the scenario of, you know, we're probably not going to create a downtrend here just yet
we're probably going to claim the resi the the support trendline, and then have a rejection
and and this is what is happening right now on the dxy, creating that kind of higher high, double top, or slightly lower high
but definitely not thinking that you are going to have an aggressive downtrend once you break a trend line
and this is basically what has happened also with bitcoin, right when we've broken this resistance trend line
you know, you might think, yeah, we're going to create a higher low here and get a pretty aggressive uptrend
no, you're likely going to come down to kind of retest this trend line and then have some bullish momentum
this is still an inverse head and shoulder scenario, even though we're very, very close to the head but it's still, it's still a higher low
now, if we do fail and break above, maybe a lot of people will be thinking, you know, inverse head and shoulder, right over here
inverse head and shoulder textbook target is getting the width of the head from the breakout
can this happen in the coming weeks? i'm gonna range trade, okay? i'm gonna, i'm i'll be focusing more in range trading instead of these, you know, uh, potential, um, potential high levels
okay, um, because, like i said, we're probably going to have a lot of volatility, and there is some money to be made on this, on this, uh, sideways action
uh, andy nepali says, andy, can ocean protocol hit 10 cents? absolutely
i think, you know, where are we at right now on ocean? i have a, i have a pretty nice bag of ocean in my portfolio
i think it must be about four percent, maybe, or something like that
um, ocean protocol, can it hit 10 cents? absolutely absolutely
let's see if we do have more data here on ocean on finance, probably, yeah
let's take a look at the vpvr to find out where, you know, the strongest levels
um, let me just yeah, bp vr is not gonna help us for major support levels
as soon as ocean starts going sideways, it will be a good accumulation zone
we've lost these lows over here, got rejected from that level
but you can see it here on the chart, where we've lost this summer 2021 lows, um, got rejected from it
could we create a double bottom scenario here, or a descending wedge scenario? absolutely absolutely
you could have that one last dip here to round about 10 cent level, and and then go sideways and break out, and then go sideways here for a long, long time, for many, many months
i do think we're going to go lower, but i would say the bottom is close
till we see that boring multimonthly sideways action with the relief rallies, with dumps, and that is going to be an insane accumulation zone
um, that's why i'm holding a small percentage in, in my longterm portfolio
before we do solana, i need you guys to absolutely crush that like button
why not? why not? in this morning livestream, guys, i need you to absolutely destroy that like button
let's take a look at, uh, solana for the community, right? threeday chart on solana, zooming out, zooming out, looking at the big, big levels
what is the biggest level as support on solana? if i zoom out, bigger support level is the 21
why? because it's a major level where we have been bouncing as support back in the summer of 2021
what else can we do here on solana? as we have broken a major resistance zone and actually got rejected
we've actually broken the 35 level, and we've actually got res resistance
i will be taking a look at that right now because, um, you know, solana is one of those cryptos that i have been talking about on live streams
you know, let's mark some daily levels where we could get a big bounce
also, i'm going to get, i'm going to mark a strong daily level right now
this one is the summer lows of 2021, which is, um the close is at 2346
so that is a major daily level where the price of solana can get a big, major bounce
and let's mark this as a daily level right away on on solana, where we're very likely going to get a bounce if we do go down there
but there was a perfect trade, uh, yesterday, early in the morning, we got a perfect rejection from this major level
why? how come i missed out on this? how come i missed out on this major resistance level? this was a perfect shorting opportunity, at least to the six one eight, from the lows to the highs
six one eight level from a low to a high is always a good take profit area
we probably did talk about this level for a potential short but, um, yeah, basically 35 to 29
um, even though you don't consolidate, it's just a must take and you can take a look at fibonacci retracement from this high
looking at the four hourly chart, and you're hitting that 618 to perfection from the start of this major drop, right? because this is still stride with action
it doesn't start from this one because you actually do go sideways for quite a bit and have a relief pump
the most, the biggest downtrend starts right there at 42, on the 9th of june
this is where you take the fibonacci, uh, retracement impulse
you do have a kind of an abc perfect 618 retest on that 35 major support
um, what's happening right now is that you are creating higher lows
what's going on here? creating higher lows that we've come in a little bit of an uptrend, having a little bit of an uptrend
um, if solana has a relief rally here, we're probably going to get rejected again
ideal scenario would be breaking the trend line and actually, from the break out of the trend line, waiting for that quick relief pump to continue back down from these higher lows
that would be the best scenario, trying to get, trying to get into the to the resistance from the breakout of this trend line
looking at the two hourly chart, nice little small uptrend that is probably going to fail
once it fails, this trend line starts getting a, you know, a breakout from, uh, from the last higher low, then you're looking for that potential get into a trade right there
i'm surprised i didn't have an alarm right there at the 35 perfect retest yesterday
uh, we are probably going to see solana and some other altcoins have that bullish momentum
so very likely that these lows are going to be retested and even broken
25 dollars a good major level for a bounce, for a quick speculation, quick make money
i think this daily level back from the lows of the summer of 2021
remember, guys, we do have a very strong daily close here before we actually claim the extreme low levels at 20 dollars, i think solana can get a pretty nice bounce at the 235
if we do lose this low over here, it's maybe going to be like a fake out, or or even a good breakout
but from 235 to 264, approximately, you could get that bounce to claim these two, to retest the highs
get into those potential moves, those bounces, those strong levels, to take advantage and make some good money in this bear market, guys

[Music], what's my crypto legends, welcome to today's live stream
are we going to manage to hold the range, hold these low areas at the 20 000 range and pump to 22, 23, 24 000
how is everyone doing? we're gonna analyze the situation here with bitcoin, of course, where we at? uh? are we gonna hold this range? are we going to have that relief rally? price action has been pretty boring
we've actually dipped below this range, almost retesting the lows
in my personal opinion, we are going to range trade for quite some time before we go, we go to much lower levels
okay? i think it's very, very possible, as we have been creating this sideways action, as we have been creating this kind of descending wedge, these kind of pumps, all right, to retest these daily levels, not managing to break below this low area of twenty thousand dollars, creating this level over here
you know, the possibilities in range trading for the next maybe one week, maybe two weeks
it might be longer range trading in between this level, or even this level over here is very, very possible for a couple of weeks
of course, if we do have that successful breakout from the low 20, of course lower is possible
i'm pretty surprised that bitcoin didn't have a little bit of bullish momentum actually
we were talking about this scenario over here, holding the six, one, eight
we actually come came down to the one to one, or the point 88, approximately from this actual pump
if we take a look at the fib levels from the low to the highs, yeah, even slightly below the a at 088
i am still in my long position that i did have from yesterday
um, stoploss wasn't hit, of course, because stoploss is behind these levels
um, still, do you think that this relief rally is very, very possible? it's just very boring action
we had the volatility from the uh, meeting, uh, two days ago, that was pretty exciting
we did have a little bit of a few moves to the upside, to the downside
this was right over here where we did create this nice, big volume with this kind of huge dodgy, uh, doji candle
uh, the volatility in between yesterday and today has just kind of died off
we can analyze what, what is the highest probability trade guys
i would like to go through, you know, different markets such as natural gas, also such as s p 500
it looks like s p 500 is just holding by a thread from this range
okay? are we going to manage to get back up from this major support level? we've actually kind of broken down from this major level here, which is the 3700 points
if i zoom back here on the s p 500, this has been a a pretty major zone where we have been bouncing several times, talking about that 3700 range
um, so holding this range, having some relief rallies before, you know, continuing the trend to the downside, i think it's very, very possible, uh, after this major drop that we've had, all right, for the last few days
let's um, dive in here, straight into the comment section right away
spanish people are always late and always, you know, manana, manana tomorrow
how are you doing? naveen, like for the greatest ta ever, wealth, it's not the greatest ta, but we try and make the best ta
we try and look for those highest probability trades, biggest, strongest levels where the price could get rejected
you know, a lot of people might say, you know, technical analysis is twenty percent, thirty percent, um
it's, i would say, risk management, 80, 10, technical analysis, 10
you risk just a little bit of money, you and you ain't going to be that nervous
in today's episode, i will show you why we're using the key levels
i've been talking about these key levels for so many days now
we had one great retest of this previous support around 21 040 key level
and now we can head back down to the next key level, and that is around 90 040
i will also show you exactly what i see on ethereum right now
but please continue looking at this video and show you what i see right now on bitcoin and on ethereum
we're looking at the weekly and we are still using the same key levels that i showed you before
these ones is so good, because when we go down to the lower time frames, we will see exactly how the market has been retesting it
but i want to show you the key level 19 000, because we broke 21 040 on bitcoin, and we can come back down to 19 040
and if we go back in time, you can see how perfectly the market gave us a retest from this level and saw this huge push to the upside
and if we slowly, steady go down to the lower time frames, we can obviously see the falling knife
and from that support, which used to if we want to buy the market, or if it will break that support and continue to be a following night, you can also see that we came back up and we tested 23 040
and you can see that on the lower time frames, we held this level as a support
and what happens when we break a support? we either come back up and retest the support one more time, or we see the market close inside
because overall, you see the market gave us a little bit of a sideways market
and usually when it comes to sideways market, we see the market give us the fake out
and i was looking at this level to see if we would see, because you can see how what a volatile bullish candlestick we had against the level again
so this is the thing, when we come, when we use the key levels, if we, if we retest the key level, and we we close below the key level, this is a very, very important for us to use
and when we saw the market closed below the key level, this, for me, is a sign that the market is actually going down
what we're gonna do is that we're gonna, as always, you already know what i look for, we drag the support trend line one more time
we connected, you could either connect it with these higher lows, and you could see how the market never had the power to break this previous high
we saw the market broke below, but we never had the power to break the high that we did have around 21 206
another thing that we also could have done if we were unsure if the market would actually continue back down now, we could have taken the support trend line and used it against this higher low that we do have, around twenty thousand nine hundred and twenty
and when you do that, you could also see the market gave us the break and retest of the trend line
and remember, now, the confirmation that we didn't have was that we also came back up and retested 21 040
so the next key level, if we start to say that the market now will have more momentum to the downside
we're using 21 040 still to see if we would somewhere, in some way, see the market pull back up and retest this level
again, remember, if we're bullish, the market needs to break above the key level, come back up and retest the key level from above
and then that could take us to 50 of the range, or we can pull back up to the next resistance, also key level, 23 040
but if we start to see the market now slowly and steady continue down, the next key level to look at is 90 040
if we come back down to this level and break it, the next key level is 7040
and you can already see how how good the market is really testing these levels
the market is using them as a confirmation to either continue to the downside, as a retest, etc
to use these levels another before we come back down to 19 040, we will also use this previous low that we did have around twenty thousand two hundred
market can pull back down to this level, see the market gave us a little retest
break it, and then see a potential lower high being created against this level
one more time, if i want to find an entry, because the market is now going down, the market has already done the move
so but if we would see the market giving us, because the market is giving us a lower low right now, if we would see the market pull back up
this is where we can potentially see the market giving us a retest of the previous high low to create a lower high
and that could be the second entry for me to go into the charts
what i'm waiting for right now is to see if we see the marketplace um to potentially twenty thousand eight hundred and eighty, retest the previous higher low, create the next lower, lower high, and then sell the market to the next lower low, which can be around the next the previous support, around twenty thousand two hundred and twenty
we saw the market broke the support and the key level, one thousand one hundred and thirty, market broke, it came back up and retested the preview support
and i was also thinking that the same thing that we didn't have on bitcoin, if we break inside, retest, that could take us back up to the range again
because just because we see the market give us some moments to the downside, if we would see the market pull back up, because i said the market can also do this right now, because we're not so far away from the previous support
but market gave us a clear retest of the key level also a couple of days ago, or yesterday
and today we retested the low of this support that we did have, around 1108
and the next key level for ethereum to pull back down to is 930
and i've been talking about this so many times, uh, since we didn't have these key levels, as you can see, the market is always retesting these levels
it's the one of the biggest confirmations that we can actually have before we enter a trade, because they are so respected
go back in time, if you go back to the weekly you can also see that from before that you saw the retest, retest, retest, retest, retest
and this is why we're using these ones right now, to see how the market is behaving
i did have a sell limit order since yesterday the market almost came up and get and activated my my cell limit on bitcoin around 21 965
but we never had the power to do that, and the market just slammed to the downside
so i'm just gonna wait and see if we see the pullback up to the previous uh support or and the the last higher low on the 15minute charts, around twenty thousand nine hundred and thirty
but don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you are supporting me and bitcoin senses by doing that
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
hit the notification so you know when i am live or when i do have my daily updates
remember, the market is going sideways during the weekends most of the time
take some time off the charts, back test instead, and we see each other later
my name is josh, and right now, the net unrealized losses for bitcoin have just skyrocketed to the highest point since the bottom of the march 2020 crash
so in just a moment, i'll be talking more about that and what it means for bitcoin moving forward
i'll also be covering other bitcoin charts later in this video, and of course, ethereum, as always, later in the video
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and at the time of recording this video, today's trading day in the nasdaq 100 index is a green day, but only a slight green day
obviously, amidst this massive downtrend, specifically today, we haven't really seen any significant moves in the bitcoin price so far
and at the time of recording this video, today's daily candle is currently a green daily candle, like what we're seeing in the stock markets
as you can see, these two markets are heavily correlated the majority of the time
and now just giving you a quick update on the weekly bitcoin chart
and right now we're still holding above that massive level of support coming into play at around 20 000 per bitcoin, which is based on the 2017 bull market top
and as you can see right here at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is currently trading below the 200 week moving average, which is this red line
and that is coming into play at just above 22 000 per bitcoin
and then this blue line is the 300 week moving average, and that is coming into play at around 17 000 per bitcoin, approximately
and we've only ever seen one touch point along the 300 week moving average, this blue line, once again, which was the bottom of the march 2020 crash
but other than the bottom of the march 2020 crash, pretty much every other significant bitcoin bottom, for example, the 2018 bear market bottom or the 2014 bear market bottom, usually bottoms out around that 200 week moving average, but sometimes weeks below the 200 week moving average, like what we saw back in 2014, 2015, and also like what we saw in march 2020
and while we're here on the weekly bitcoin chart, obviously the weekly bitcoin rsi is still well and truly into oversold territories, as i've been saying over the past few days
and if you're going off pretty much the last decade of bitcoin price history, the times where we see the bitcoin rsi on the weekly chart enter into oversold territories usually come pretty close to at least some sort of major bottom
but with that being said, there's another bitcoin chart that tells us we're potentially getting very close to the bitcoin bottom, but we might not be there just yet
and that is, of course, this chart right here, which is actually an onchain bitcoin chart, as i discussed in yesterday's bitcoin update video
because the indicators on this chart are derived from the bitcoin blockchain, they are not derived from the bitcoin price, like the moving averages i just talked about on the other chart
now, once again, i went into more detail about this chart right here in my last video, so i won't spend too much time on it in this video
so if you missed my last video, definitely check that one out
but basically how this chart works is when these two lines cross over, when the pink line actually crosses above the orange line, that usually means we're at the bitcoin bear market bottom
according to the last two significant bitcoin bear markets, the 2014 bear market and the 2018 bear markets, you can clearly see that each of these previous bear market bottoms
and the bear marker bottom actually came into play right around where the lines were sitting at
and right now, these two lines are currently sitting at around seventeen thousand dollars per bitcoin, approximately, which means it's possible we could see some sort of bitcoin bottom roughly around seventeen thousand if we break that twenty thousand dollar level of support
but keep in mind, we have not seen these two lines cross over just yet, which means, according to this chart, and according to bitcoin's previous price history, we could still have a little while longer before we reach the bitcoin bottom when eventually these two lines cross over
but you can clearly see that these two lines are moving closer together, which means they're potentially getting much closer to the bitcoin bottom signal that we're looking out for, but they're not there just yet
and another important bitcoin onchain chart to pay attention to is this chart right here, which is bitcoin's net unrealized losses
and basically how this metric works is, if a bitcoin moves on the bitcoin blockchain at a price lower than when it last moved, then that would show up in this metric right here
so for example, let's just say someone bought one bitcoin at 60 000 per bitcoin, and then they didn't move that bitcoin at all until a lower price
and then more recently, when the price is lower, they moved that bitcoin again, out of that wallet, maybe to sell it
then because of the fact that the bitcoin price is now lower than when they last moved it
in that example, that would show up in this metric right here, which is the purple line
and so basically, as the name of this indicator suggests, net unrealized losses
it tries to calculate how much of the bitcoin supply is currently sitting in a loss from when that bitcoin last moved, in percentage terms
so right now, this bitcoin on chain metric is currently sitting at around 05, which is around 50 percent
which basically means around 50 of the bitcoin supply that moved recently is sitting in a loss from when it last moved
and if you take a look at the last time where this bitcoin on chain metric spiked up towards around 50, that was at the bottom of the march 2020 crash
and generally speaking, when we see a sharp spike in this onchain metric, that usually means we're seeing some sort of capitulation that usually turns out to be a pretty good buying opportunity
and the bigger the spike in this metric, the bigger the opportunity
but i want to make it clear that that is not financial advice
i'm simply telling you what this metric means for bitcoin and what has happened time and time again throughout bitcoin's history
and just giving you a quick update on the bitcoin order books across all of these exchanges
and right now we still have a lot of buy orders coming into play at pretty much exactly twenty thousand dollars per bitcoin, which would be acting as major support at around that twenty thousand dollar level, as i talked about in yesterday's video
once again, and if you're looking at the short term bitcoin price action here on the four hour chart, you can clearly see that we do have strong support at around twenty thousand dollars per bitcoin
and just updating you on this four hour bitcoin bullish divergence that i've been talking about over the past few days
and as i mentioned in yesterday's video, this bullish divergence is potentially already beginning to invalidate
and right now we have formed one lower high in the four hour rsi but so far, at the time of recording in this video, we're still seeing higher lows in the four hour bitcoin rsi, which is good to see
but of course, this lower high does show some weakness starting to form in the four hour bitcoin rsi, which also shows some weakness in this bullish divergence
so i would not be expecting a massive pump in the bitcoin price due to this bullish divergence alone
because, first of all, a bullish divergence just means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, which in most cases is mostly choppy, sideways price action
and over the past few days, that's pretty much exactly what we have seen after this bullish divergence
but moving forward, as this four hour bullish divergence is once again showing a bit of weakness, i'll mostly be paying attention to that 20 000 level of support to see whether or not we hold that level
and almost the exact same thing can be said about ethereum against the us
but unlike bitcoin, the fourhour ethereum rsi has already drifted below this upper training line of support
but at the time of recording this video, the four hour ethereum rsi is still technically in a higher low structure
and we have put in one lower high, which once again shows some weakness in this four hour bullish divergence
so as of right now, in the immediate short term here on the four hour charts for ethereum, i'd mostly be expecting sideways price action like bitcoin
but once again, i'll be paying strong attention to our levels of support, because, of course, if we begin to break our support, that is when we could see another leg to the downside
and for ethereum, we have major supports coming into play at just above a thousand dollars, more specifically at around 1050, approximately
because right at that ethereum price we of course have the 382 fibonacci level coming into play
and also, as i've covered in recent videos here on the channel and also on my twitter
so by the way, if you don't follow me on twitter, definitely check that one out, link in the description
but anyway, as i've been saying, there's actually quite a lot of leverage built up in d5, and there's a lot of liquidation prices coming into play for ethereum at around 1 000 dollars per ethereum
so basically, if we see the price of ethereum start breaking below that one thousand dollar level of support, that could trigger some liquidations happening for ethereum, which could continue an ethereum dump
and obviously, in that scenario, that would be very bearish for ethereum, which is why it is very important for ethereum to hold above that one thousand dollar level of support
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum short positions on the before next exchange
right now, these positions are pretty much almost at all time low levels
and in case you're new to the channel, this chart right here shows how much ethereum, so essentially how much money is sitting in short positions
so if this chart goes down, it means a lot of money is flowing out of ethereum short positions
so basically whales are exiting their positions, because we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here
meanwhile, this chart right here shows the percentage of ethereum short accounts on the buybit exchange
so basically, instead of showing the amount of money in short positions, it shows us how many individual accounts are currently shorting ethereum compared to the amount of accounts longing ethereum
and right now, the amount of accounts on buybit shorting ethereum are basically at all time or high levels, which means there's a lot of people shorting ethereum
meanwhile, the big money has already left their short positions
so this is definitely something to keep in mind moving forward
because usually when we see a major spike in these ethereum shorts accounts on buybits, that usually means we're somewhere near at least a shortterm bottom, like, for example, back in january or the middle of last year
whereas the ethereum short positions on the bifinex exchange, which shows the amount of money sitting in those short positions, when that other chart spikes to the upside, that usually means we're getting close to some sort of top, and we could be due for another crash sometime soon
but interestingly, right now, the shot positions across these two major exchanges are basically showing the exact opposite
it shows that there's somewhat limited downside price action according to these leveraged short positions
and speaking of these by bit short positions, right now, buybit's actually hosting the biggest trading competition in the world, which you can find a link to in the description down below
and i actually have a team in this competition with 43 members currently
and if our team places well in this competition, then each of our team members could potentially win a share in up to 8 million us
and to join this team or find out more, once again, check out the first link in the description and the first link in the pinned comments
but i want to make it clear that this is not for complete beginners out there
this is for those of you who are more experienced in the market, know how markets move, and no risk management
and if you want to know how to keep making profits in crypto, even if prices are going down, then check out this video popping up right here on your screen, because this video can help you do that
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video

the bitcoin price is currently 21 179, and the crypto crash seems to be continuing
so how long is this bear market gonna last? well, you can see that the price is threatening to make new lows at the moment
as uh discussed yesterday, this is still the primary liquidity zone that i'll be looking, uh, towards for any meaningful bounce
and that's if i am going to attempt to catch a falling knife, right? so as professional traders, we supposed to rather buy the higher lows and catch moving trends, momentum trends
but at the moment, i mean, the prices seem too good to be true
and i must be honest, i am attempting to catch a falling knife
you can see the rsi on the fiveday chart is continuing to go down
and i'm gonna show you on this chart, exactly from a greater perspective, where we at
so, um, something important to note again is that whole mean reversion trade, right? so when you take your you take the 21 ema on the weekly chart, and you ask yourself, okay, where did this uh move start to sell off
so from that level over there, we currently at about we've gone as low as 539 percent down
now when i back tested this, i found that in the worst case scenarios, price deviated away from that 21 ema about 55 in the worst case scenarios
but because it's sticking around here for a long period of time, it tells me that it's probably not the low yet
and actually, i have one more order, which i'll touch on now, on a particular altcoin
just to remind everybody, we're looking to play the mean reversion trade, which is going to be looking something like this
and then we're going to sell everything off again, targeting ultimately much lower, in the 12 000 region
we have to adapt with new information as each day passes and each week passes
now, one of my reasons for being somewhat bearish today is, if you have a look at the futures market
so i have the s p 500, uh, on the normal chart over here, and then i have the futures chart
and i told you for a long, long time now, i've been targeting that key quarterly level and the precovert area over here, where the initial covert dip happened
so coughing up all the gains from yesterday's fomc meeting, which was a 75 basis point rate hike, it seems like jerome powell is looking to do probably the same thing, uh, next month
so at the moment, there's not really any sort of signs of a change or the fed pivoting yet
so markets, i'm still going to be uh, erring on the side of caution and mostly playing the capital preservation game, looking to just make shortterm moves, right, like the mean reversion trade that i'm aiming for
okay, having a look over here on the fourhour chart, you can see that price? uh, came straight into the 21 ema on a fourhour chart, and then it started to deviate down, rejecting off of that
uh, as soon as you start to threaten these lows at around 20 100, it's probably going to push through
the question is, how are the momentum oscillators looking? is there going to be enough to get it through? well, if you have a look here at the four hour momentum oscillators, they are only just starting to turn over
if there's a very bad day on the stock market today, uh, then that is a possibility going back on the stock market though
i just want to also give a bit of perspective, so let's just make this one bigger
so if you have a look here, it's got still to reach those levels around another 20 percent
so 12 to go on, that might put bitcoin down about another 20 or so, and altcoins maybe about 30 to 40, which is still essentially what i'm targeting
i'm gonna go to ethereum, over here, you can see the main liquidity zones
the ultimate targets that i have in mind are still coming down about another 20 from here
you can see that this was the short play that we had coming from the top over here with the underside resistance
you can see that price tried to get above the 21 ema, very similar to bitcoin, and it started to turn over, deviate and come down
once you start to lose those lows, i would say that probably this target 2 starts to get back on the table
but i because things are so overextended, i'm personally not looking for any shorts at the moment
and then once we have the next major bounce, that's where i'll be looking to load up on new short positions
one trade that i do have set up, actually, which is the other one that i said, is solana
and that's just because salon has been really, really hit hard
so i do think that this is one that will probably survive the bear market and recover
and if you have a look at that, back into that liquidity zone, it's going to be at about 37
but the liquidity zone falls between twenty and about eighteen dollars and fifty cents
uh, watch for this area over here, if you can, if you see that the momentum oscillators start to gain momentum to the downside, whilst price, so if you see something like this, let me just draw it for you, if you see momentum oscillators coming into about that level, will make that bigger for you as well
and then you start to see price coming towards this area over here and threatening that level
whilst the momentum oscillators still have a lot to go, i would say probably we are going to be making new lows
if you do want to support me as well, you'll see the bybet link over there too
if you want to follow along with any of the trades, for proper setups, i'll be posting that on, uh, twitter
when i do make any sort of a trade, i'll make sure to post it there
i'm just sitting on my hands, waiting for the next high probability setup
this is what you'd expect after these fomc meetings, is a little bit of instability
the market tries to process what's going on, what's happening, and then we start to get more high confluence trades
everything, to me, personally, is still pointing to the downside
the altcoins, in my opinion, have still not been hit hard enough
i know that a lot of people are in major pain with regards to the altcoins, and a lot of them are down 90 but i would expect a little bit more
some of them can come down another 10 to 30 percent from here
so for the long term, investors, dollar cost averaging, maybe not a bad idea
i'm personally, i've put a little bit into bitcoin, but i'm not really playing a heavy, dollar cost, average game
i'm staying more cash heavy, just because of the macroeconomic environment and what's currently going on

not only a worldwide gaming community, unix is a launch pad, a gaming studio and a tekken content creator that serves the bridge between web 2 and web3
how is everyone doing today? thursday? let's take a look at what's going on with bitcoin
what is the highest probability scenario where can we make some gains? let's take a look
make sure to absolutely destroy that like button on your way in here
are we going to hold this range and potentially get a large relief rally in the next coming hours, maybe couple of days
i'm going to show you what major levels i think we could reach
um, we have broken out of this kind of descending wedge scenario
over here, we are actually at a major level that we were talking about in today's morning live stream, where we potentially were going to get a consolidation
but now the question is, will we manage to hold this range? are you willing to risk something for that potential move to the upside, at least to the 618, or at least to gain these highs over here with a little bit of volatility and potentially fail back down? this is the question, guys, this is the question, have you got the risk management to potentially take a trade at these levels? i mean, i'm not looking for shorts at these ranges
um, a good shot would have been right over here at the rejection from this major daily level
this is when you decide to step in, or or or not, or or think that you are, we are going to go lower
now, i do know that we do have a little bit of support here at these levels
from this low to the high, we kind of round about that range, the six one eight, six five range
okay, we're expecting, you know, that move to the downside, potentially to that twenty thousand eight hundred dollars, right? it could come into this low point over here, expecting that rejection end, coming down to this range for potentially moving up to claim these highs
i'd just think that we could get a major bounce from these this range, you know, at least at least halfway from this drop
okay, potentially to 50 or 618, depending on how we consolidate at this range
if the price doesn't have enough steam to move back up, then it will get rejected and continue back down
uh, i just want to let you know i am in a long position from this range
you know, this consolidation was enough for me, this big spike on the vpr is enough for me to think that the price is gonna get some bullish momentum in the short term
it's gonna be quite hard for bitcoin to actually, you know, breaks these certain levels
we've got a solid level here at the twenty one nine, uh, twenty one thousand nine hundred one, 21 800, approximately
and if we take a look at fibonacci retracement, you know, it's the 50 right over here, the 21 800, and the 618 is the 20, um, 22 000 area
so expect some kind of rejection if we are going to get this bounce here to the upside
uh, expect the price, it's gonna, you know, take a lot of steam to move up
but overall, i have a target here for this potential pump that's gonna happen, you know, in the next coming hours, next, uh, you know, two days, give it, give or take, you know, two or three days
maybe it might be today, it might be, you know, it might be in eight hours
um, but, you know, i think we could claim this daily level, what daily level? the 22 700
i think we could get that volatility and create a trading range just like we, like we did, you know, um, just a few weeks ago, right where we had a massive, big trading range, uh, just bouncing between resistance support, resistance support, you know, prepreboring, claiming the highs and claiming the lows, you know, for several weeks
um, i think we could, we could actually have this kind of price action
i think it's very, very likely we're going to have this price action, uh, sideways action, a little bit of relief, rallies, you know
and the good levels that we do have here that will be very likely be claimed before we go to ten thousand dollars, guys, before we go to three thousand dollar bitcoin
yeah, we are probably going to go lower, but let's try and trade, uh, the range
when the price is getting exhausted, exhausted, right? when you have these slightly lower lows, right? and, you know, you're breaking from aggressive lower highs
you you can see, right over here, the breakout you are creating, you know, a consolidation from a major level
it is definitely worth the risk in my personal opinion, and with my, you know, technical analysis and trading experience, it's definitely worth the risk, you know, for that pump at least, at least to the 50, even 618 fibonacci
it's definitely going to be a take profit zone for me, and it's going to be a level where i will be protecting myself, just in case, you know, i will be leaving some of the the position open
uh, this is, of course, if i do not get stopped out, um, you know, to to to get some more profits at these highs
i think, you know, it's very, very likely that we probably going to claim these highs, which are exactly at the 20 27, 228, claim that level and then potentially get another, another rejection, big rejection
dxy got a pretty sharp rejection today, between yesterday and today
i mean, this is something that was also very much expected, something like this, something that we were going to create, a kind of a double top scenario, a slightly higher high, or a slightly lower high, but a kind of a double top scenario coming to retest here
looking at the four hourly on the dxy, this resistance, this support trend line
okay, this major support trend line being retested after a breakout, saying, you know, it's very likely we're not going to create a very aggressive downtrend just yet on the dxy
we come all the way up to retest the trend line, create a higher high or a double top, and then get the correction
it's dropped, you know, between yesterday and today, about two percent, which is pretty high for the dxy
you know, this might have a nice reaction on bitcoin in the immediate short term
so, um, yeah, that's something that, um, and wanted to point out, of course
will btc dump or pump from here? i mean, i don't know where the price is going to go
and, you know, we are looking for a potential balance here if we do have a large consolidation
so that balance is very, very likely where to, at least to the 218
you know, we might just consolidate here, do something like this and back down, but, you know, i've got stop losses so i can protect myself
okay, so getting this rejection from this daily level here at the 22 twenty 700 thousand seven hundred, mentioned today
okay, getting the rejection, we were very likely going to get that correction
very, very likely, down to this level, where is the price going to stop if we continue back down? um, you know, it was mentioned today, guys, if you check out today's live stream, you know, in minute nine, approximately, we were trading at twenty one thousand nine hundred
we were looking for that twenty thousand eight hundred dollar range where we could be consolidating for the moment
price is doing exactly what i was expecting from today's live stream
um, now, are we going to manage to have this move to the upside, right, kind of claiming the highs and maybe get rejected from these daily levels? uh, of course
i would be protecting my position and taking profits if we do manage to reach this 21 800 range, because it's a strong range
it would be the 50 percent between 50 618 from this major drop
i mean, will it? will bitcoin have a good effect on this? will bitcoin have a relief rally? this has just happened from this morning till to till now
okay, it has been starting to drop aggressively from about 10, 10 o'clock 10 11 o'clock, right from 105 to 103, is slightly above 103
so this should have a good effect on bitcoin in the immediate short term, especially at support levels
breaking resistance trend line, you could get that short term effect on bitcoin to the upside
okay? that we got the 218, big, big zone, and we also got the 228, another another big zone
okay? i do think we could maybe, you know, break above this level and then actually consolidate at this range, maybe get rejected, or maybe even break it and get to the top of the wedge at almost about twenty four thousand dollars
there's another major daily level that was not respected as support
it actually was a strong resistance, as you can see here on the price action from the 13th of june
so, you know, i think the possibilities in claiming twenty four thousand dollars in the in the next coming days, is is very, very possible as a relief rally
you know, i have seen these kind of movements before on bitcoin, where you have an aggressive drop, price action gets exhausted
you create a descending wedge, you break out, and then you create a kind of an inverse head and shoulder scenario, claiming here this major um, this major level, all right, at the 228
we're on about the 24 000 area where you pro possibly gonna get, you know, heavily rejected, you know, between 24 and 25, and then continue back down
um, i don't think that that price action is very, very possible, only because of the price exhaustion
you know, price is kind of getting exhausted, right? you are seeing a little bit of of exhaustion right there
um, you know, if we consolidate here for much, much longer, then, you know, it's not going to be looking safe
you know, a big, big, long consolation then probably is not going to be that good
i think we are going to be training in a sideways action range
this is what i think that is going to happen in the next coming months, not months, sorry, next couple of weeks, potentially, you know, range trading, claiming the highs, claiming some high levels, and also claiming some low levels, right? a little bit of range trading before we go to 18k, before we go to 15k or 13k
um, because we've dropped a lot for the last, you know, couple of, well, not a couple of weeks, you know, from the 9th of june till the 13th, uh, just about four or five days, we've had a very, very aggressive drop on bitcoin
we've lost over 35 percent of its value in about five, six days
um, mark dutch, thank you very much for joining the live stream
why? why did you wake up and you got wrecked? why? um, andy, buenas amigos
at this moment, i am in a tiny long position here, all right, on on bitcoin, just at the 28, 20 800
looking for that 21 800, taking profits and protecting position
um, guys, if you are interested in trading, if you are experienced, you know, on buy bit, you do have an insane bonus down below
of course, only for experienced traders, only for speed traders
if you do enjoy the content, guys, smash that like button right away
and let's just continue with what is going on here with bitcoin
well, i think this is something that i am looking for, something that i do think that the price action can and can do
we've got a major low level value area, low from the big spike on the vpvr
we could be getting some relief, rally, claiming some highs, claiming some liquidity here
we're going to have some different um youtubers, you know, saying that we were going to go over was 20k, the low you know, this is, this is the good thing, you know, when when you and, uh, you do analysis, you can also, you know, kind of predict or what what can happen, also on youtube
so this is the thing, you know, i do think that it is possible to claim 24, even 25 000 at the most, in the coming days, coming weeks
i think it is possible, just because of this kind of formation
so, but i do think the claiming the 227 is very, very possible in the coming days
claiming this high, i think this high needs to be claimed before we continue back down
andy, check out the descending triangle pattern on the 15 15minute chart
okay, let's take a look at the 15minute chart and the descending triangle, descending triangle pattern on the 15minute chart
i don't see a descending triangle here, or a descending? yeah, i'm not sure what, you, what you mean, if you bearish, then how come relief rally? oj, we i mean, this is because we are consolidating at a major level
i am mid long term bearish still, i think, for the next coming months
but come on, we do not drop, usually, in a straight line to the downside
i am a trader also, and i want to take, you know, opportunity here and, and, you know, find some relief rallies to make some money
it doesn't matter, you know, you know, this is the idea of trading
it doesn't matter if you, you know, if you bearish or bullish
i'm bullish and bearish, you know, a few times, uh, every day
um, hidden bullish divergence on bitcoin on what time frame? jacob, hidden bullish divergence? that must be, at least in a very, very high time frame
if it's hidden bullish divergence, that has definitely got to be in a very high time frame
you know, i'm not, i don't use, i used to use rsi a few months ago
i don't actually use it because just by looking at the chart, you know if there is divergence or not
but i guess the hidden bullish divergence, it has to be at least on the weekly, potentially
i mean, let's get the rsi out, you know, let's have some fun with this lagging indicator
um, i can see already it's not on the, it's not on on the weekly charts
we got the rsi making a lower low on the rsi from november of 2018, november december, when we did have that drop from 6k to 3k
we are creating, we are at extreme oversold territory on the weekly chart
so, yeah, i mean, hidden bullish divergence maybe on the monthly
um, let's just take a look at the monthly chart and take a look at the rsi
see if we do have that, you know, hidden bullish divergence on the monthly
so you got lower lows on the rsi, higher lows on, uh, on the price action
this has nothing got to do, uh, to to have a reversal, right? now, a big reversal and bull market continuation
you could easily come down to ten thousand dollars and still be creating the the bullish divergence, right? the hidden bullish divergence
trying on the 15 minute, i can't see that descending triangle in the 15 minute chart
seb, seb, how you doing? my man? mark dutch, joseph, i got my moderators here, giving power to the community
uh, bitcoin rejected at 215, yeah, in the immediate, short term, yeah, it does look like we got a little bit of a rejection here
did we go that high? what is the high here? the high is 214, 214 here on the buy bit chart
um, can you please use a regular mouse instead of that of the touchpad? get a painful headache from your cursor erratic movement
let's scroll down here quickly and just, you know, let's take a look at, you know, hello from korea
why not? why not? guys? it is the moment in the bear market to make gains, to make chain link
what have we got here with chain link? um, there was a little bit of a hype here on chain link, where, uh, staking was going to validate the, the the network of chain link
i remember calling that news coming out, you know, staking uh, link
and what is happening with a chain link? basically, it's just successfully, at this moment, creating a double bottom
we might be getting a a double bottom scenario, not an adam and eve, because adam and eve usually is a big spike to the downside, and then nice consolidation and then back up
we've had a nice round formation, and we might have a little bit of a vshape recovery on on chain link
you know, this is the thing, i do not do much analysis on the old coins
and i'm actually going to ask the community, i'll be putting four cryptos that i like to do analysis, and they can choose two for the competition, and i'll be doing full analysis on levels potential entries, um
so, yeah, if you haven't joined the, the the bybet competition, the link is down below
it's gonna be difficult because there's, um, there's a lot of good traders out there, but there's also a lot of bad traders
and it is actually bouncing every single time from this lower low trend line
you know, these this is, you know, when a lot of people say trend lines on the chart and are worthless
you know, you could count four times, because you need two actual lows to make a trendline
you can't randomly put a trendline on the chart, right? so it's bounced four times from that trend line
so trendlines are very much respected uh? hidden bullish divergence is on the one hourly chart
trion, okay, let's take a look at the hidden bullish divergence on the one hourly chart
does them? does my mouse bother you guys? does it bother anyone else? let me know in the comment section
does it bother anyone else? um, it can't be hidden bullish divergence on the one hourly chart
will you take? are you saying hidden bearish divergence? or, you know, because to see hidden bullish divergence, you need a very strong uptrend
this is the kind of price action that you do create with creating these low lows for those bearish divergents
but, yeah, no, no hidden bearish, no, hidden bullish divergence
but as you can see here on this cheat sheet, to have that hidden bullish divergence, you need a strong uptrend creating higher lows
so you need higher lows on the price action and lower lows on the rsi
okay, let's take a look at one of them because i like to do a few minutes kimchi
i mean, this is was absolutely insane, how thor chain respected here on this move to the upside in april
absolutely crazy from this height to the lows, hitting the 618, getting the rejection from this trend line
this right over here was an insane shorting opportunity for a swing trade on on thor chain
what support level? the 340 cents, where we did have a support consolidation here
we had january and february, bouncing from this level consolidation and absolutely losing the range
it seems like a large capitulation could happen here on thor chain
getting above the 350, in my opinion, it's just gonna continue down
and a large, large consolidation maybe before we we finally move to the upside
so what major level is good on thought chain? is this one right over here, where we did have very good resistance back in 2020
and i think it can get a very, very good relief rally, a very good balance from those levels
uh, it was where we do have the largest, you know, largest vpvr range
look at this, one dollar ten cents, round about that level, the one dollar range can be a very, very good accumulation zone for for thor chain, especially if you're going to start going sideways at that level here, for the next coming weeks, couple of months, if you start going sideways at that range, it's very, very likely going to be a good range to accumulate if you are bullish on on thor chain for the next coming years
if you want to trade it, though, if you want to trade it for some right? i know why i got this
we've got the four hourly chart, right? big major zone, big major levels right there
[Music] here with a white horizontal line, we've got this low area
also, let me just put that in white also, it's because it's on the four hourly chart
okay? you do get, you did get one here too, slightly below, all right, but you do, you want to, you want to get into the first second bounce, not into the third bounce
this one didn't get much of reaction, but this one right over here did, to the exact scent, to the exact scent
what level? this is a low level that we did create here, a low and a high, created in january
we had the high and we had the low, very much respected level here, back in 2021, january
if you are a fast trader, if you are a scalper, it was an insane long position right there to make some gains
if we do pump to the 22, 20 cents, very likely going to get rejected
[Music], relief rally, a bigger relief rally, is is very likely on thor shane, uh, not much too not much to add on this one? not much to add
what is it doing? is it dropping? is it pumping? yeah, i mean, bitcoin not is a little bit boring
i think, i think some bullish momentum is very, very likely, very likely
i mean, this is the thing, you know, people that, you know, might come in and say, why are you bullish now? what are we going to to uh, thirty thousand dollars? twenty five thousand dollars? no, no, no, no
i only think that we are gonna have short term bullish momentum
we're probably going to claim the highs of 20227 and maybe 24 000, possible, the highs here, from this descending wedge scenario
i think it's very, very possible then to continue to back down, especially when we do have the dxy dumping it like this
so this could have a good effect on bitcoin in the next coming hours
you know, this is giving me positivity for bitcoin to actually get a larger relief rally
um, it's just very, very likely, you know, just not by only looking at the dxy chart, but by looking at, you know, this kind of formation, kind of an inverse head and shoulder, if you wish, right there, probably going to come and claim the high z at 228
i think it is highly probable then actually, you know, coming down from this range, it, it would be very, very strange
i have these, i have seen this kind of movement on the chart before
and the highest probability is actually from this level to pump
and if we do come down from this range right now, in the coming hours, and lose the twenty thousand dollars, i would be pretty surprised, actually, i would be pretty surprised
it's not, it's not a, it would be a rare movement on the chart that you don't usually see
but, you know, this created a pretty nice symmetrical triangle
they actually, you know, got to the exact, exact target the back here, the projected move
sometimes it's pretty, pretty amazing how easy baby tech and textbook technical analysis sometimes can be very, very well respected, especially with the projected moves
so, for crow, the crow, for crow, for crow, well, i mean, this is the, uh, it's very hard to say
you know what lows that we did have here back in in the summer of 2021, uh, were around about the the the eight, the seven eight cent level
you know, we could be on our way to to reclaim, to claim the seven eight, uh, seven eight cent level in the next coming days, weeks
could you get a small relief rally, because we're getting a consolidation right now? absolutely
but bear market lows, just as a pure speculation, uh, you know, round about that seven eight cent level, potentially the the lows of the sum of 2021, where you could have a major, large consolidation the moment we start going sideways
for the next coming weeks and months, guys, is where i will be talking about lows
because a lot of the cryptos, some of them are going to die off
but good projects such as crow, which i do think, you know, it will have a recovery
um, they do have an insane team, insane marketing behind and they will take advantage of the next hype at some point
so once this one goes sideways, you know, i would say, you know, this is starting to be an accumulation zone
this is starting to to feel, feel like it's, it's a floor level, just like what ada did back in 2018
if we take a look at the ada chart, and, um, you know, not on coinbase, on binance, and zoom out on the three daily chart, for example, you know, this is the kind of price action that you want to see
we've got all of the cryptos making a big, massive, big bubble burst, and they are trading and going lower and low and lower
and what we want to see on the rest of these charts is this kind of movement, right? this, this kind of sideways action, where you are, you are dropping, but you're losing steam on the drop
and you need several months here to make this kind of price action
once we start making this price action, you know, this is where i say, you know, the the bottom is likely to be in
this is an accumulation zone right now, because there's no selling pressure
and what happens, you have several, several months of accumulation, even a couple of years, and there is a moment where you have the disbelief rally, the disbelief rally before their insane rally
there you have one disbelief rally in july of 2020, major correction
this is going to come back down and, you know, continue sideways action
i think crow could also do that, um, kind of price action in the next several, several months and enter a large accumulation zone
um, so bear market lows, i would speculate on seven, eight cents, maybe around that range
did any anyone know any good bullish channels? bullish channels
um, is it time to be bullish yet? is it time? well, it obviously is time to accumulate
make sure to get ready, because morning live stream, i will be going after natalie
if you're longing, if you're shorting, make sure to protect your position
i think that the price could be easily reaching the 218 in the next coming hours
because of this consolidation, because of this bounce, this kind of inverse head and shoulder, everything points out that we could have a little bit of a relief rally, maybe hitting the 228
i would be taking the rest of my profits if we do hit the 218
at the end of the day, we need to try with the best thing that you can do is protect your capital
protect your capital overall, guys, check out the insane bonuses
if you are interested in trading oil, natural gas, s p 500, you got primex bt
primex bt is my favorite, because you can use bitcoin, ethereum or stable coins as collateral
we got into, i got into a very nice short position here on natural gas, waiting for that kind of distribution event
everybody is panicking out there, saying that natural gas are going to go, is going to continue skyrocketing
i think that it's going to have a major correction first, which is it is happening right now, and then potentially we'll go back up
and on, uh, buy bit, you get up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus

you want to find out what us management company, make sure to check it out, the link is down below
let's analyze the situation here for bitcoin to see what has happened
where have we actually broken? where are we bouncing from? where are those opportunities to actually make some huge gains here in the market? and we're going to analyze the rest of the cryptocurrencies
i just want to go quickly here through what has happened to bitcoin
yesterday we were analyzing the situation here of this kind of descending wedge
okay? while i was doing the live stream yesterday, we were trading around about this area, and we had, you know, the scenario of actually breaking the resistance or actually getting rejected from this level
okay? we're already hitting the trend line, okay, getting rejection from this range
so the possibility of of the price of bitcoin getting rejection from this level, to come down, at least to this area at least to round about the six, one, eight levels
all right, creating a potential higher low was very, very likely
this was mentioned on yesterday's live stream, getting that possible rejection
okay? i didn't mention, i just mentioned it in the telegram group
or i was actually trading the 618 from this level to reach the 618 from this high over here
it was the only trade that i took, all right, but it wasn't mentioned
and also, what we did talk about yesterday, if that, if we did have that breakout from this resistance trend line, where were we going to get rejected? guys, it's super important, because this is stuff that i mentioned, if you have your levels marked up, you know, be ready for for potential trades we were talking about
of this resistance, the biggest point of control was at these levels
and you know, the possibility in getting a rejection from that twenty two thousand two hundred, twenty two thousand three hundred, was very, very likely, at least to round about the 50 fibonacci from the lows, or to round about the trend line, okay, where we could get a bounce as support
it is what happened, all right, yesterday's trading opportunity
i did not take that, take this trade, because i like to, you know, wait for a consolidation, you know, wait for a potential reaction
but there you have that rejection from this last lower height, from this big, major point of control
and, you know, you can see it here on on yesterday's video, looking for that rejection at that same lower high after the breakout of the trend line
of course, we did have that correction first, but then broke out from the resistance, and exactly got that rejection from that 222, 223 area that was mentioned on yesterday's stream
if you didn't get this with a limit order, uh, you probably didn't catch that quick drop
what also happened here is that, looking at the 15 minute chart, we did actually get that bounce from this resistance trend line
very difficult trade as well, because if you take a look at the one hourly chart, it's, it's like a big, massive rejection
uh, looking at the one hourly chart, a lot of wicks, a potential big rejection here
when i see these massive wicks on the one hourly, i would have just stayed patient to see what is happening
so, looking at the 15minute chart, guys, and i'll go through the, through the comment section right away here, just, um, after looking at bitcoin
but where are we getting rejected right now? uh, where are we consolidating? and where have we failed to break? resistance
in the past, on the 13th of june, we have had resistance, with a little bit of volatility, but we've had resistance, all right? this was on the 14th of june
but we did get, um, a pretty nice consolidation at this range
if we go to the one hourly chart, this is one of my favorite time frames to look for day trades, or small swing trades
uh, one hourly and four hours my favorite time frames, because that is where i i defend myself better, uh, for trading bitcoin
and you can see on the one hourly where you you did get that rejection
you might somebody, you know, people that haven't been paying attention
what is this daily level? why have you got this green horizontal line that has been respected several times? closing on the one hourly, below this range, okay? or above as support? well, this horizontal line is from december of 2020
okay? it's a daily level from a low range that was traded back in 2020
this large consolidation for a week that we had was from december of 2020
and the daily closes and the daily, uh, daily closes and opens from the highest point
if i just fast forward, zoom in here, on the one hourly, these levels have been pretty much respected
is this a breakout? is this signs of a reversal? are we going to come down and retest the low 20 000 area? or are we going to manage to actually find support and continue back up for this relief rally? so this is something that we are going to analyze
where are the potential levels? because this pump has been pretty, pretty nice
are we going to manage? we need to find out what major support levels where the price of bitcoin can actually bounce
let me just take a look at the 15 minute chart and analyze here where we could get a potential bounce
because one of the strongest levels, also, looking at the vpvr from the last four days traded, approximately, we got a spike here
you can see after this mountain here at the 227 volume, you know, is pretty, pretty low on the vpvr
also, we got a very nice spike here on the vpvr from volume traded, you know, in this range
let's take a look at the vpvr also on the dailies, uh, you know, we do have that
is potentially for a day trade for a kind of a scalp, you know, enter a trade, protect your position very, very fast
you know, the biggest, biggest volume profile, the point of control from yesterday is exactly here, at the 21 100
if the price action starts coming down aggressively, and we do see several candles reacting at this range, then these major consolidations might be holding the price these lows
you might get a small liquidity grab below this area, and you'll probably be hitting the 618, or a potential leg up right there
if you look at elliott wave theory also, we have got the extreme low here
are we going to have another attempt? and then, you know, this might be the good shorting opportunity where we're gonna have another leg up and then get a massive projection
um, so yeah, i think a potential bounce from the 212 could be very, very possible
we got a nice, we got a nice point of control there from yesterday, right there
if we do get a small reaction here, uh, it might be a good longing opportunity
um, only if we do get that reaction, of course, because, you know, a lot of people might place limit orders
if i place a limit order here, we have, we might have the price just absolutely slicing through this level
i only take a look at the opportunity if we do get a reaction at that range
what is a reaction? well, it's several candles on the 15 minute
and you can see a reaction where the bears are not managing to break this level in the immediate, short term
yesterday we were talking about this potential resistance level, okay, potentially get, uh, you know, getting rejected
you can see on the 15 minute not managing to have a 50 minute candle closing above the six, five, six, six one eight
if you go to the one hourly, you do have a couple of candles also at that range before having that major drop
so, um, yeah, this is what i would say, you know, have have a reaction at this level, or a potential quick long
now, of course, if you are long in this area, where could you get, um, take profits? definitely at the six, one eight
from the major drop, fifty percent six, one, eight, i would be aiming just to protect your position
take some profits, uh, protect your position and try and ride the potential retest of these highs and maybe slightly a few candles
right? where would i i would be taking profits just after the breakout of this range, if that makes any sense
to everyone, make sure to smash up that like button on your way in
of course, if you are newcomers here to the channel, absolutely crush that like button
um, just to be clear, i am in no trades on bybit at this moment
i was slightly negative, then came back up and exited right over here
um, afterwards, we did get, you know, some pretty nice volatility
ben engine, how are you doing? um, donald trump is satoshi, says solomon garuga
has vincent, how are you doing? hey, mirage, how are you doing? job
hey, andy, have some trading signals? um, you have some trading signals? or do i have some trading signals? well, yesterday was pretty cool
this is the thing, you know, once you have your levels marked, if you you, or depending on on how aggressive you are, you either jump in a trade or you you missed the trade
but it was a quick, quick rejection from this, uh, 222, 223, quick rejection down to the actual support
i know a lot of people, you know, um, they struggle to take profit
if you're not fast with your, with your capital, um, yeah, you basically, you know, if you short here, then you get this move, you might panic, sell here because you're a negative, or your stop loss is, uh, you need to be very, very fast
this is one of the best things i have, i have done actually, the last, you know, a year of training, because i am learning every day
also, i've only been five years learning technical analysis and trading
it just has to be, as long as you don't lose much capital, then you will survive
and the best thing i've been doing the last year is just taking profits, protecting position, taking profit
and if you do that consistently, then you then your capital is like, oh, your trading account does, you know, does does grow
and you're like, yeah, this is and this is the just because you're taking profits and you're taking and you're protecting your position consistently, uh, and trying to get into the best, best, uh, high probability trades
you know, um, when we mark these levels, guys, you know, just realize just realize, you know, how how, how kind of perfect this entry is
it's not perfect because we didn't get the consolidation, but just realize how you can step in that trade
and you can step in, all right? you're shorting here at a resistance zone that we mentioned yesterday with a vpvr
and you're also taking profit out of support where you could get that bounce
and you can, if you can actually decide if you want to long that support, of course
so the, you know, if you are a fast trader, if you are a scalper um, you know, i do, i might do one or two scouts maybe in the week or three
it's just, i cannot, i don't, i don't feel comfortable to consistently do, you know, enter and exit trades um
but, yeah, i mean, definitely, for the competition, we'll be doing some crazy scalping
if you are new here and you're not in the competition for the private world series of trading, wow, you need to join my team right away
only people that are going to join the team can join the telegram group

this, this trade um telegram channel, is only going to be open for those 20 days, all right? because we want to absolutely crush it
it's only going to be trading opportunities, all right? looking for those opportunities, and also looking for scalping
i'm gonna, i will be doing a lot of scalping for the competition, of course, looking for those short term trades
also, we'll be focusing a lot in, you know, actually getting into those small scalps, okay, with high leverage to get into these quick movements on the market, rejection on the daily
you know, i probably would have taken this short, probably would have taken this long

who loves the morning stream says, naveen, absolutely wonderful
i mean, this is going to be an early stream because, um, it's an early stream because i have to do some stuff afterwards
i've still got this, this voice from from waking up just, um, less than one hour ago
how are you? rio? al pacino, hi, uh, what's up? andy, how are you doing? my man? i'm doing very well
i've got joseph and mark dutch, my strongest moderators, here, giving it all
i got a super chat from someone from pacman just given me a very nice compliment there, saying that is learning very, very much from my videos
thank you very much for those kind words and for the super chat
okay, i really enjoy this, especially when i have comments like this
andy, can you do a quick, uh, a quickie on on ada? absolutely
let's do a little bit of a few minute analysis on ada to to find out what, what have we got on the chart? let me just, let me just see [Music]
how one second ada, let's take a look at 88, right? this is the daily chart
hang on one second, because ada is getting rejection here from a major level
uh? if we did, if we did take a look at ada yesterday, you know, i've got these boxes here
i mean, we got this major support level that we got perfectly rejected
if we go to the one hourly on on ada, i guess you want to know the short term analysis on ada
just a few hours ago, it was three o'clock in the morning for me, so i definitely couldn't have taken this opportunity
but we did have this major support range on ada, which is exactly at 54 cents
you do see, all right, the more reactions you have at that level
okay? you can actually extend this box to this range, right? you do see that this 54, 55 cent level is a is, it's some, it's a major zone
i mean, this was also beautiful, i'm a beautiful short position
so we, we, we did get that solid breakout from this major zone, the 54 cent, and we got that beautiful rejection
what happened right now? i mean, this was a little bit of a risky short, but it was, it was a potential scalp, okay, scalp day trade
why was it a scalp day trade? you are coming back up here to one of the strongest levels from the last, you know, couple of months
this is a a pretty large zone, um, where we do have some major, major levels that have been respected
so if you come up at a resistance zone, when you are pumping like this, and you are seeing this, these kind of wicks, okay? there is a little bit of a consolidation here
you can assume, with this kind of price action that you are getting exhausted
if we go to the 15minute chart, you know, this is already price exhaustion
you know, this kind of volatility here on the 15 minute this is not solid bullish momentum
the more candles you you create while you're going up, the more signs you can see that the price is getting exhausted, especially when you're hitting a major resistance zone
so this just, i mean, i'm just going through what happened a few hours ago
what are the most important but first of all, let's find out, you know, where we're coming from, so to to see where we can go
so we got that rejection from this level, uh, this is the 54 cent range
what is happening right now? what ada also created was a kind of a double bottom scenario, right? we created a double bottom scenario right over here
of course, i wouldn't have longed here, and i wouldn't also, uh, along this range
and we just, we are getting, yeah, we are getting this rejection from this range
it's, this is a very, very difficult one, very, very difficult one
i mean, after this could be a kind of a bump and run scenario where you do have the aggressive drop, double bottom scenario
you are going to consolidate at this range, and then you have a breakout in a and a larger relief rally
okay? it's, it's a little bit of a risky one, but it can, it can get a reaction from this level and try and attempt to break the highs again
the highest probability trade on ada would be a solid breakout from this zone, right? and, you know, let's find out high probability trades right now, because trading the zone is a little bit too risky
if ada does manage to get a pretty aggressive pump in the next coming hours, the 50, i mean, will come in hours, few days
if ada does pump, remember, i am looking for short opportunities
of course, if we correct down and bounce out of support, right? this is the only raw way to trade the crypto market, in my opinion
if you are a breakout trader, uh, i, i am pretty sure you got wrecked many, many times
breakout trading on on on um cryptocurrency, you know, doesn't work always
it's not a an incredible strategy because there are a lot of fake outs
but anyway, um ada, take a look at major levels, major opportunity levels
you know, another reason why we are getting this rejection from this zone, you know, that it's a value area low from the volume traded here the last, you know, 10, 20 days
so we can see the value area low right there, getting that rejection
but most importantly, guys, where is the opportunity? i think, you know, this is a major opportunity
we can see there's a solid support level at the 58 cent range
so if ada does have a pretty aggressive pump in the next couple of days, we might consolidate
we need to find out where can we get rejection if we start pumping like crazy? because you're going to get a bunch of people saying, ada, 8888 is pumping
where are we getting ready for that rejection? in the case of ada, we're looking at the 58 cents
and if you want to add, you know, one of the best confluence that there is, you get the fibonacci retracement from the top here of this major drop that started on the 8th of june till the 13th of june
and you know, just like magic, just like magic, where do you think the 618 is? where do you think the most respected fibonacci level is? it is exactly at the 58 cents, guys
it is at six, the six one eight is at 58 cents, where we do have the strongest spike on the vpvr, where we do have very solid bounces as support
so ada suddenly starts, you know, making a massive bullish action
you are going to either wait for a consolidation or jump in, because the probabilities in getting rejection from this level of the 58 cents is extremely high
you know, the probabilities in getting rejection here, i would say, is at least 75 percent
you are going to get rejected for 25, you know, of chances getting a break out from this zone
i'm actually going to put an alarm here, um, i hope, you know, it's funny, because i do get a bunch of messages, uh, when it's midnight, okay, when it's early in the morning, two o'clock, four o'clock in the morning, of course, i do not trade it, but if it happens during the day and i'm awake, you know, i will, i will take a look at the the reaction
it's funny because i do set a bunch of alarms, uh, you know, on some, all coins, at some levels
and then, you know, early when i wake up, i got a bunch of alarms
they've all been hit, uh, you know, midnight or two, three o'clock in the morning
but, um, like i said, very, very, very, very good level here on ada, the 58 cent level for for that major opportunity
okay, just looking at the zones here, six, one, eight, big spike on the vpvr
it's a very much respected area with a little bit of volatility
if you do get this, i mean, this, this is the kind of consolidations that i want to see
if you break up, you come down and you get that consolidation, you go back up
take profits quick because, you know, people get excited, um, when they are in profits, and they might just say, okay, i'm gonna leave the trade, just in case, you know, we go to higher levels or lower levels
this is why i take, you know, fifty percent of profit, seventy percent of profit, i like to ride something, you know, just in case you do get that, you know, um, free ride
if you do protect your position and you just close, you know, sixty percent, seventy percent of your trade, you have 30 percent there
you know, where was that? you know, this was an insane shorting opportunity that we found out on the 12th of june
guys, if you're an old subscriber, do you remember this insane trade that we talked about on the 12th of june? you can check out the video or the live stream
my target here, i closed 50 or, yeah, i think it was a 50 on my trade from this shorting opportunity at the 281, 281
big, big rejection opportunity we got the resistance trend line, of course, giving us that extra confluence pushing the price down
where did i take 50 of profits without the 277? i think right about around a bit at this level
it was a quick, quick, take profit zone, just think, because there was a big candle here to the upside with some pretty high volume, you know
and we did have, you know, this resistance level that could have get a reaction i support, of course, i wouldn't have longed this, because we are, if you long this level, you are fighting the trend
and, um, basically, i took 50 profits here, protected my position, and i got into a free ride to the downside
i can't remember where i closed, but it was definitely an eight to one, you know, something like that, something crazy, uh, you know, risking, uh, risking one and gaining eight times what you're risking at the end
okay, it wasn't eight exactly, because i closed over fifty percent
it must have been, you know, another extra four to one, uh, from my risk
so, i mean, this is, this is the thing we trying to get into the best opportunities
um, you know, if only, if we do get up there, guys, only if we do get up there, i do see a major, major shorting opportunity at this 58 cent level
we have the possibility in actually not going to that range, but, um, it's a big, big, major level
so let's, um, of course, your question is, if i do, i almost second
if your if your question is, you know, ada, big spike on the vpvr 58 level from the last 20 days traded
if we do short this level, where would you take profits? where are you taking profits? well, i can tell you already that it is very likely to at least come down to the roundabout the 54 cent i mean, it's only a four cent move, but if you're looking for day trade scalps, it's more than enough
if you take this level and ride it all the way down to 54 cents, which is very likely gonna happen, you get a five percent move with a little bit of leverage, yeah, you making some pretty cool gains
uh, you know, you use a 20x leverage, 10x leverage, you know, it can be a 50, 100 percent move
uh, to that 54? why? 54? because it's this major support level
if you come up here, you take the the short and you don't take profits at this major level, which is a value area low here on the vpvr, we've been seeing resistance and support, then, yeah, you might have that big bounce and and get stopped out, or stopped out, or break even
whatever you do, take profits, definitely at this range, because it's a major support level
okay, in the next coming days, if we do reach that level, there is a possibility that that level is not going to be reached, and we're going to continue down
you got a very nice bonus down below of up to four thousand and fifty dollars
it's another way to support the channel, of course, because because i get a small commission
why not? joseph mark dutch, my men's thank you very much for giving me insane support
let's take a look at the um at ethereum right now, right away
just going through the comment section here, uh, right away, just to see, uh, take a look at the comment section
but before we take a look at ethereum, we before we do the ethereum analysis, i need you guys to absolutely destroy, i was gonna say, 500 likes
well, we do have a level here on ethereum that has been rejected
i mean, this is all this must have i'm not sure if this was mentioned yesterday
i do not remember the bunch of all coins that i've taken a look unless i have, i have stuff on the chart
but, uh, we probably mentioned this on yesterday's stream, i'm not too sure right now
i mean, just to keep it simple, we don't have to go far away on, on, on ethereum, we don't have to take a look at the daily time frame and zoom out
um, these are some major levels that i had to do yesterday, i think, because i wanted to get some, some stuff ready for the next stream
uh, this is not on the daily chart if i zoom out from price action
okay, just so, just so you know that this is, you know, these are, why are daily levels important? why our weekly level is important? if we take a look at the price action from, uh, january of 20 january 2021, look at these major daily levels
okay, well, you can just see here, right? daily levels on on as resistance, getting a bounce from this major daily zone, right? why is it a daily zone? because you have main a lot of daily closes
um, in this in this level, right? what level? the 1 370 range, where you did get a breakout and a beautiful bounce, a reaction, right there
so, you know, if we start breaking this zone, which ethereum has, we need to find out where do we have the strongest levels of support
you have these daily levels where we did get a reaction on the price
we have daily close and open on the ethereum price exactly at that one thousand and forty dollars, one thousand, one hundred dollar range
so if i fast forward here, you know, we have exactly got a reaction from this range
we go to the four hourly, these daily levels are getting a reaction, guys
maybe this level is not going to be broken anytime soon, and a bigger relief rally is possible
so if i just zoom in here on the chart, uh, we could go to the one hourly
the amount of volume here is absolutely crazy, from [Music], from the last, you know, couple of days trading this zone
if we go to the four hourly, you know, these are four hourly levels, also four hourly levels right there
big, big, big resistance zone, four hourly candles, not managing to get above this area
if we come back up and retest the zone, you know, very, very likely going to get a shortterm reaction, shortterm, um, you know, resistance level rejection
just quick, you know, get in protect positions, start taking profits at some major support levels
what support levels? you know, where i can see already here, where the price has reacted, if you're looking for scalping day trades, right? this is a major zone
so, you know, if you are shorting this major resistance, your take profit zone is going to be here at the 1 160 range
just guys, just to go through level to level, just so we understand how important these levels are
there is a possibility here on ethereum, we do take a look at the two hourly charts, you know, are we forming a kind of inverse head and shoulder? these kind of patterns, you want to find them at a very end of a trend for a potential reversal
what daily level? the one that i just explained from uh from january of 2021, we got one right over here, getting a reaction
so if we do lose this zone, there is also a major quick opportunity here on ethereum
very likely that this level is going to get about what level, the 100, the 110, dollars spike on vpvr, major consolidation
expect a potential reaction at least, you know, one 1 110 range to approximately 1160, level to level, level to level, um
it's a potential move that is very, very likely going to happen
so, i mean, this is the cool thing about, you know, as being, you know, as being a trader, you you trade level to level, right? you look for those opportunities, level to level
you know, when you look at their price action right now, you basically have no idea
no trader has any idea what the price is gonna do right now, right? but i don't care
you need to get your levels marked up, and, you know, that is it
where am i going to be ready to react at a level here? here is my trading opportunity right over here, why is it your trading opportunity? because it's a level that has been respected
it's a level where i do see a spike on the vpvr volume has been traded, you know, just the same as here
this was a resi, i mean, this happened early, early in the morning, but i would have probably taken this shorting opportunity, especially seeing this reaction at this level, if i would have turned on the live stream, you know, just, um, i mean, it was at two o'clock in the morning here, uh, i would have said, guys, you know, this is very likely going to get rejected
and we do have, you know, major resistance here, as you can see, you can see the reactions
would be, i would be potentially looking for those longs, long opportunity here, maybe at one thousand one hundred dollars, one thousand one hundred and ten
and it's a level to level trade, from support to resistance right there, because you might do this, you might do this
you can lock up some trades, maybe have some some open just in case you are going to create that reversal inverse head and shoulder pattern
it's very likely to get a bounce at this zone, the one thousand, one hundred and ten dollars
more interested right now, instead of swing trading, looking for those day trades, small swing trade position
you know this, these positions that can be in between one day, three days, four days
hey, andy, have you heard of litten tree? uh, enlightened tree
i don't want to do project reviews on on the live streams, but if you have joined the telegram group, you can absolutely tag me, okay, in the next few hours, because i will have a quick, like, look at this project
what is the what is that? are their intentions, you know, as a crypto project? what do they want to do? are they going to solve many issues? are they projects that are, you know, do have competition? going to take a look at their partnerships, their investors and and take a look at their roadmap, you know
but all of this, of course, is too much information in the live stream
you're always free to tag me there once in a while to ask some questions
about litten tree, i mean, i will take a look at it, okay, but it's not going to be done here on the live stream
we can take a look at the chart, but it as it as, it's a very small, um [Music], very small market capitalization
um, you know, it's very, very likely had a big, we actually did some analysis on this big, massive fake out here on this kind of ascending triangle, big rejection
not much here to add on on this um, on this chart, of course, we're just going to have a big, major consolidation, i guess
on literature um at this level, not much to add very, very basic here
you know, we are getting that reaction from this low support level, um
but i guess you want to know what the project is doing, if it's a good project or not
i will be taking a look at this project a great in my spare time
of course, i like to take a look at crypto projects, of course, as a cryptocurrency investor, apart from a trader, to see what are these guys solving
tag me there, afterwards we can have a conversation about the project
if you've been for a while supporting the channel, following me, you know we've got some crazy mods there
we've got some crazy followers also, uh, which are also good guys
hope everybody doesn't feel offended of what has happened on telegram, because there's been a little bit of, some fights in between some people
in the in the in the general chat for the telegram group, guys, make sure to join it
apart from talking about training opportunities, it's there to have
i need to deal with my with with the mods, because, yeah, they've been there for such a long time, good or bad
we've been taking a look at ethereum, taking a look at ada a little bit of bitcoin, you know, major levels
if you want to trade traditional stock markets, you know, uh, or crude oil, gold, natural gas, you name it, they got forex here
so all of that, you know, that all those games that you make it here
it's my one of my favorites for accumulating bitcoin, you know, trading different other markets
let's try and accumulate as much bitcoin as we can for the next coming years to absolutely have a wonderful and peaceful life ahead of us, guys
check out the bitcoin centre's website for the latest news, technical analysis ideas
okay, that we do have here free information that we got on the website
and this was a key level that i had since before, which is really good
i, i've said this a couple of times, i just might come to london in september
and i wanted to see if we could, um, i wanted to see if we could, uh, just have a meet up or something with the people from london
lauren, hello, how are you? do this bubbles weapon and nadia russell, daniel, can it? uh, muhammadu ami, yo, christian, hello
if you haven't gone in and like the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can help me with the algorithm and reach out to more people
so we're just waiting for some people to jump in and or whatever
shame about the trade link yesterday, but we're going yes morning
where and how did you learn? ta, darling, i was sitting in front of the charts 24 7 for so many years
i had definitely a few, couple, a few few of you, like two to three very good mentors
it doesn't matter who who, how good the teacher you are, of course it matters
i said every single day since 2018, and i still do it, i still do it
raj, can tell you, and everyone in this beautiful community also, because we have this great community with consensus
you must be a proud leader, natalie, because everyone starts to be so good at trading, but everyone, you know, do their work themselves
i only share my knowledge, and then if you choose to take it, if you choose to take it
you see, even though i'm a financial advisor, i just love this
but i'm not gonna take anyone else's um success away from them, because i know, i know how much you must sit with it
and if you take that to your own experiences and make it to your own thing, you should take all your credit yourself, because you are the one doing the job
um, how can i join the group? you have the group, and lauren just, um, lauren, just put the the group in the chat
the only thing that we do require is that you are polite, you show each other respect
you know, this is just a regular human behavior to treat other people with the respect and the way you want to be treated yourself
and everyone is on their different journey when it comes to trading
gbp usd, okay, so around new york session, we have, uh, some news coming out today
but, um, it's not, i'm so lucky if i'm not on my training journey
okay, so we do have some news coming up tomorrow at the beginning of new york sessions
so, um, even though if we don't have, uh, the red boxes, it can definitely be some movement
we came back up so perfectly to the key levels, so perfectly to the key levels
and let's see, we can go to to dxi, because i saw that we did have a gap here
last two times the market went up a fed day, but dropped badly the next day
so when when it comes to the news, so we did have a live stream yesterday
and when it comes, when it comes to the news, it's, it's usually going against the trend
and with them, when news comes out, the market usually goes against the trend
but looking on on, uh, on the dollar index, we came back up and retested a previous higher low
as always, this microphone i have, still, i have still not fixed it
but okay, so on dollar, we're right now retesting this previous resistance
so this is the daily, right? and we can definitely continue to um, continue to the upside, obviously
how are you? but if we would see that we break below 104764, and this could be where the mark is
slowly, instead, it comes back down to the fibonacci levels, only for a pullback now, 103352, potentially 102 points, 860
and from this level, we expect the market to create a higher low on dollar index, and then market slowly breaks to the upside um
i've had these for a couple of days, and i guess a lot of you also have it
okay, so we're coming back down to retest the previous, uh, two daily candlesticks
so of this huge, big candlestick, i'm taking the wick as a, uh, i am, i'm taking the wick as a guideline now, to see what's gonna happen when the market pulls back down to this level? so what we're gonna do? um, oh oh
we're just gonna go down to the lower time frames and see what potentially can happen
so what i usually do, and what i always do is that i, i always use diff multiple time frames
um, some people say you can use three to four different time frames, but i like to have, i just like to jump in between
because for me, it's just like, i'm just trying to see what how the candlestick is, how they're looking at different time frames
so that makes my brain be able to calculate what's actually happening, because the candlestick is obviously the ones telling us exactly what the market is doing right? [Music]
and we're using different, different levels to see that we are right now
can you see how perfectly this was the wick from the two last daily candle that i used? now, can you see how perfectly the market just closed above it? so let's see
now, if we would see the market break below 20, was it, uh, 21 868, and see a potential retest from below, we can retest both
if we say that the market break below this level, then see mark come below, retest it
just because we're sitting at the charts, this doesn't mean the market, we can always find trade opportunities it
i mean, we're just going to the charts to see what potentially can happen
and sometimes we have setups right away, and sometimes we just have to wait for the market to move
and this comes, uh, this also comes in with patient, which a lot of people don't have
that's a lot of people think that they will find a trade right away when they're looking at the chart
but right now we don't have that, because we're, i'm not sure what the market will do
so if we would potentially see the market break the support trend line, which it will kind of do, and then come back down, everything kind of depends on how the candlestick is looking
if we have a lot of volatile, volatility to the downside, this is definitely another drop
and we can come back down to 19 040 if we see a little bit more momentum to the upside
because remember that on dollars, we are expecting the market to potentially come back down a little bit
so if if the market on on dollars pullbacks, bitcoin also pull backs
and the pullback on bitcoin is to the upside, because the market is in a downtrend
so, but for me to be uh, sure that we're also, let's say now, for example, that i find a buy position, what i want the market to do is that i want the market to break above this fibonacci level
also, this previous lower high at 22 118, so around this level
but i want to see the market break that level, then see market pull back down to create a higher low
and then at that time also i will look at and see how the candlestick is behaving
but at that point, i will use another fibonacci to calculate where the higher low can be
so for the for a by position, for a little bit of a bigger pullback, we need to break the previous high high around 22 130, so around this level
if i'm looking for a a break to the downside, i want us to break and read tests at around 21 868, and then see the continuation of the job
if i sell the market, my take profits will be further down than my take profit on on the um, on the option um
so where can we potentially see the pullback too? if we see a pullback to the upside, i could potentially see it come back up to 23 057
it don't doesn't look that good now when i have all of the things
and so if the market crossed this resistance channel line, the trading view will give me a notification
if the market crosses down the support trend line, the market is reversing back down
uh, you haven't been so long on this live stream, but it's so great to see when people continue to be here
and it's just, i just love to see you guys continuing to come into this, uh, live streams, and you're so polite with each other
uh, what price if okay, sorry, i didn't give you the price on bitcoin
so i don't have a fibonacci level now, because if the market, if the market would go back down, i will also use, i usually use the fibonacci, but you guys already know that but if the market falls back down and you start to see more momentum, the next level is 19 040
but if i sell the market, i i will obviously have more um, take profits, uh, based on the fibonacci also
but everything depends on from, everything depends on from where i i potentially could sell the market from, and where the fibonacci, where the level comes um
yes, where have you been? where have you been? you trade based on price action and fibonacci levels
price action, my eyes, is the biggest indicators, to be honest
so when it comes to ethereum, when it comes when it comes to ethereum [Music] experience, let's see, very volatile candle on the weekly charts
so if we would see a pullback on on ethereum to the upside, now we just might see the market at just the same thing on on, uh, bitcoin
but i think ethereum gives us more, i think ethereum gives us a better ta
it was a little bit messy on bitcoin, i'm not gonna lie, because we broke this resistance trend line
so what we're going to do is that would drag another fibonacci from 1090 back up to 1237
so if we pull back down and then slowly, instead of see the market break to the upside on the lower time frames, because you can see that we're right now, in the lower timeframes, looking at a downtrend
and we need to break the downtrend to see if this fibonacci will be valid
but i would definitely want to see the market pull back down to to the levels that i spoke about and then slowly instead, to see the market the same way that we broke this resistance online, you see the break, market comes back down to create a higher low
but for me to not getting faked out, and for me to have a better confirmation, i also want the market to break this resistance, create the higher high and then the first higher low, depending on how the market, how the higher law is looking
and if that is the case, uh, based on this fibonacci, take profit one will be the high at one one thousand two hundred and fifty
and take profit three would be one thousand three hundred and eight
i'm sorry, take profit two will be one thousand three hundred and ten
because i use the higher time frames fibonacci levels for then potential see the market then reverse back down
and i know that you're gonna be like, but why don't you fix it? because i don't know how to do it
okay? but if we would see then the market break to the downside
this is, this is how it com the important thing here is now to see how the candlestick is looking, because the if you start to see some movements like this, builders
if we see the market have a bigger momentum to the downside, we see recess from below
guys, if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
i am very good when it comes to the technical very, very good, i would say myself
and if you want to be part of that and just have a community where you can talk with other people, we have some
and if you want to be part of that, lauren, my wonderful, wonderful moderator and admin, will send you the link to the chat
if you are also new to the channel, uh, you can also go in and look at my previous videos
but one of the most important thing that i think, uh, for you to do is look at crypto trading for beginners
you don't have to be a beginner, beginning, but these ones, i explain so simple how the market moves in market structure, country trend lines, how to avoid fakeouts, etc
i have so many, many, many, many other things that i am working on behind the scenes myself
i am back testing so much, so i will also become better and better and better
or when i want to become a better technical analyst, for example, i need to go in and back test the charts
and you can go back to these previous live streams that i did have
in this one, for example, i was talking about how to use trend lines
and and we also had another one when it comes to supply and demand zones, which is also really good, because from supplying demand zones, the market comes to these levels, and they just retest them, and then you see a huge movement after that
but in this, in this episode, i show you how to spot the the supply and demand zones, the way i do it
and then a lot of the other ones, i i talk about my my strategy overall, but most of all, with how to use the fibonacci
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so i'm always available for you if you have any trouble, please tell me, and i'll try to help you as much as i can
i'm gonna change up, but you have it, um, [Music], i'm gonna pin, uh, um, you have it pinned in the in the in the chat now
so if you want to be in contact with the community, you have it in the chat on
how i how i use my brain for it? okay, so what i want to see first, how it looks on nasa? oh, tomasu, i'm not sure if do you look at this live stream
so, masho and me, this is another great guy that we have in the community
and yesterday we actually spoke about the market pool back up
so what i did was that i took on nasa on last 100 from, i took a fibonacci from 11 863 back down to 11 thirty on treating you, you, uh, you can't see this, but we on, we, this is a gap
i just need to look at it, because i can see the gap on meta trader for but i cannot see that on trading view
so the gap is between seven hundred eleven thousand, seven hundred and four, right? cannot be eleven thousand zero four, like this, maybe
i know that you you don't look at it, but it came exactly to and the, uh, and the high, 11 855
why am i doing eleven thousand eight five six, eight five six
this was the gap that we did have, um, that i told we, me and tamasha spoke about this one, and i told hey, the market always failed
market always, always, always fill the gaps, and or at least try to come to it
and the market came exactly to the the low of the gap, eleven thousand four, seven hundred and four
and the same thing if you drag the fibonacci from eleven thousand eight hundred and sixty five back down to eleven thousand three hundred and twenty two
this is actually great setup, because even if we kind of miss the trade, uh, based on the fibonacci, this is what i wait for to see if the when the market gives us the lower high
so the market is right now trying to create a lower low and go down to the lower time frames
and based on the trend line that we also have on the one hourly chart, from this, uh, from the wick connected to the to the higher lows on the 15 minute chart, you can see how perfectly the market broke this level, retested it, and then you saw the drop
so every time we're not, i cannot always use the fibonacci as a as a tool, it's definitely something that i feel more secure with to use
and sometimes you miss a trade because you don't know if the market will just melt
um, but based on that, we saw the market break the fibonacci at 11 662
and when you see slippage through the 50 or 61 percent, in this case, this is the 618, and then we start to see this big movement
in my head, i'm like, okay, this is only fake up from the from the fibonacci
so what i also could have done is take fibonacci from the high to the low, and you can see how it came exactly and retested to measure
i do this 24 7, but i'm still amazed every time i see how the market is just retesting these levels
and your brain is going to be like, oh, just do this, this, do that, and it will be fun
this is why i love, this is why i love trading, because you just puzzle everything together, and then you realize, dude, i'm actually really smart
i am so smart that i can actually do this because the chart doesn't lie
i didn't take this trade because this happened like this during this night and i was asleep
i'm not sure if you're, if you're on inside the trade, but 11 200 is definitely a level we can pull back down to
i mean, from from entry to take profit one, that is four thousand five hundred and seventy eight times your money pips
we can go to use 30, because i know that to my should love use 30
okay, so this is one good thing when it comes to one of the videos that i do
so if we use the previous option, you can see the market creates lower lows and lower highs
when we use the previous higher lows, you'll see how the market respect the previous at the lower high on the downtrend, respect the higher lows on the on the uptrend
this was not so good, but you can see how the last higher low was combined with the next lower highs
we can also do this, because we can, we have a little lower high, right? a previous higher low, and we are creating a lower low
so if we as this is on the weekly chart, i i, i don't guess anymore
you're just, and i'm so happy, because you show me how to see that
obviously, we take the fibonacci from 31 468, back down to the low at 30 345
but it's just like market does this over and over and over and again, over and over and over again
so so say, for example, now we're looking at the charts right here
the market is against the previous highly low that we connect with the next lower high, and then you see the market retested 50
so two confirmations when the market pulls back up to these levels is that, okay, we are in a level where we expect the market to drop from, right? so we go down to the lower time frames
okay, so we understand that the market pulls back up to this level
okay? this is kind of a very ugly head and shoulders, but a head and shoulders is something that, um, that we use as a beverage reversal pattern
and you had it against the fibonacci levels, also combined with the previous lower high
so we see the market break this level, right? we came back up
so the second confirmation is that we can use different support and resistance trend lines
well, you know what? back test it and you will feel secure with what you look at
it doesn't have to always have to be perfectly when you know what you look at, you know when the what levels you look at, that's amazing
what happens? take fibonacci from that high, 30 940, back down to the low, 30 770
retested the 618 percent and the 50 what happened? take profit
okay, let's see what you guys want me to look at while we're on the live stream
we are gonna look for aave for edgardo, if he's still on the live stream
we were just going through it on bitcoin, and i i just showed you, i just told you that i don't have anything
okay, looking at aave, but i'll go, i'll go back and, salty tears, i'll go back and show you what i see
we came back up and retested, uh, we we came back up and retested the 60c a, 60c 66 and, uh, 685
we're using the support trendline as a guide to see if, if we will create the mark
i cannot use the fibonacci yet either, because the market is still going down
um, so everything kind of depends on where the lower low will be created
um, potentially, either we use this high at six to eight dollars, or we can use 652, or potentially 647
everything kind of depends on how the market looks right? and say, for example, now the market will reverse back up, and we have a small pullback against the support trend line
but as i told you, i cannot use the fibonacci if i don't have a if i don't have a that i don't if i don't see it pull back
but we're definitely in a great level when it comes to aave for a potential sale opportunity
i've seen this since i started watching long salty tears charts
without the possible, possible why stuff is happening, it's like reading half a book
and it kind of looks like we're actually going to have some big momentum
okay, so if you're looking at the daily chart, we can definitely feel this week, um, that was created yesterday
and if we we are using the support trendline as guide, as i told you before, the thing that i told you, when it comes if i would see the market, uh, create a pullback to the upside
we need to break 22, 208 82 to create a high high, and then potential retest that level for a higher low that could take us back to higher targets
so what we're looking at right here can be in fake out to the upside
so while people try to buy the market, the market will con will continue to go back down
um, i i don't like to be honest when the market is going down like this
we're also coming back down to to retest this previous high low
um, but in between 21 858 and 22017, this is where we potentially could see the market, uh, pull back up to
and as long as we're not breaking above 2013, and you start to see a lot of dojis, you just see that the market doesn't have the power to break this level, because at that point we are below the support again
so i would, i would look at this previous support, if we say pull back, to see how the market is, is retesting it, uh, from below
and at the take profit, if we continue to see a drop now, uh, we will fill the width that we saw in the heights on the daily and that that is 20 137
if you break that level, i i look at 19 040, because that is the key level
and if we start to have a pullback on the lower time frames, as you can see that we we just might have right now, we can also use a fibonacci from 22 135 back down
if we now have this 15 minutes candle is closing in seven minutes, uh, we just might pull back up to twenty one thousand nine hundred and twenty and twenty one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight for a small pullback, and then see the continuation of the drop
i actually, you know, this is also something that i would look at, but i, i'm gonna put an alert and see if we will come back up and retest that level
and if i start to see that, okay, the market will only retest this level, i will also go in for a self position
not right now, i don't, i will not go into it right now, because i want to see, because if we would have a bigger momentum and close above the level, as i told you, that can take us back up to higher targets and potentially retest 23 040 again, because that is also a key level
i i was actually on a great call a couple of days ago with a great, great guy, and he spoke about it's very important to understand, okay, technical analysis is really good, but why does the market give you a engulfing candle? so i'm looking more into becoming better, to combine the fundamentals with the with the ta
uh, as i told you, i work so much behind the scenes to become better myself
and i just love to share my knowledge with you guys, because i know how hard it can be
um, this is the first time watching you, and in 10 minutes, i have already learned a lot
guys, if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go in the icon first
so looking more to economics, and definitely something that i will do
youtube, if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that so you can see when i have my daily updates and when i have my live streams
if you want to be part, if you want to be part of, if you want to be part of the big consensus community, natalie, we have different ones
he is also very, i think he is very good when it comes more to fundamentals than what i am so he's definitely a guy that you also want to learn ta from
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video, and we see each other later
and i, me and andy always do the we always do every single day updates about the charts and short videos about what we see so far
bitcoin census also do have a website that i definitely suggest for you to go into, because on this website we update you with news
and, um, so go in here and just see what what the website is about
you have guidelines here whatever you need help with, how to buy bitcoin, how to trade bitcoin, etc
so don't forget to go in here and just update yourself when it comes to cryptocurrencies
stock market put in brand new lows, while this important bitcoin chart is getting much closer to forming a signal that we only see at the exact bitcoin bear market bottom, according to the last two significant bitcoin bear markets
but even though we're getting close to that signal, we have not seen it just yet
and i'll be talking more about that, alongside other bitcoin charts, later in the video
and of course, i'll be including ethereum as always, towards the end of this video
and this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
basically, after having that recent green day post fed meeting, today we've actually formed brand new lower lows in the stock markets
and considering the fact that the stock market and crypto are pretty correlated the majority of the time, this has also resulted in a bit of a shortterm pullback for crypto today as well
but interestingly enough, right at the beginning of the trading day for the stock markets, the stock market basically almost immediately put in new lows today, while the bitcoin price, at least at the time of recording this video, has not broken below yesterday's low
now, of course, that could happen at some point in the future, but at least as of right now, bitcoin is holding up relatively okay today, compared to the stock market
and speaking of bitcoin, getting into the bitcoin charts today, this right here is the monthly bitcoin chart
and right now we have massive supports coming into play at pretty much exactly 20 000 per bitcoin, which is where the 2017 bull market top is coming into play
so this 20 000 level of support is definitely one of the most important levels to watch, at least as of right now
and while we're here on the monthly bitcoin chart, you can see that the monthly bitcoin rsi is still the most oversold it's ever been in bitcoin's entire price history, right now
and just heading over to the weekly bitcoin charts, nothing much has changed since yesterday, so i won't be taking too long on this chart
but basically, we have the 1000 day moving average coming in back up towards around 28 and a half thousand, which we have already well and truly broken down
and then we have the 200 week moving average, which is the red line, and that's coming into play at just above 22 000 per bitcoin
and then the blue line is the 300 week moving average, and that is coming in at around 17 000 per bitcoin
and historically speaking, if you're looking at the previous bitcoin bear market bottoms and other massive bitcoin crashes like march 2020, we usually end up seeing the macro bitcoin bottoms form around that 200 week moving average
so basically, according to pretty much the last decade of bitcoin's price history, if you've bought bitcoin around that 200 week moving average and held for the longer term, then you would have done very well, according to bitcoin's entire price history
but then in some extremely rare occurrences, we do see a quick wick below the 200week moving average, where we actually bottom out closer towards the 300week moving average, like what we saw in march 2020
and also, back in 20142015, we did see a decentsized week, actually two times below the 200week moving average
and right now, that's potentially what we're seeing at the moment, considering the fact that the bitcoin price is trading below the 200week moving average at the time of recording in this video, like what we saw in march 2020, where we saw a flash crash down towards the 300 week
but once again, i pretty much covered all of this in yesterday's bitcoin update video
and this also coincides with what the weekly bitcoin rsi is doing, because usually in these macro bitcoin bottoms, we see the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories, which it is right now
this right here is basically the average cost basis for each individual bitcoin
and right now this realized bitcoin price is coming into play at around 23 000 per bitcoin
and historically speaking, if you're looking at other major bitcoin bear markets and also other major bitcoin crashes like march 2020, it's actually very normal to see the bitcoin price drop below the realized bitcoin price, which is the yellow line, by the way
but once again, according to bitcoin's entire price history, basically anytime where we see the bitcoin price itself, which is the blue line, dropped below the realized bitcoin price, which is the yellow line, that essentially presents us with an amazing longterm bitcoin buying opportunity, according to bitcoin's previous price history
that's just simply telling you what has happened time and time again
and now taking a look at this important bitcoin chart that has actually predicted the two previous bitcoin bear market bottoms
and in a way, this is kind of like the opposite of the pi cycle top indicator, which is essentially two moving averages that cross and predict bull market tops
and so far, the pi cycle top indicator has been very accurate at predicting bull market tops
first of all, obviously, it tries to predict bear market bottoms instead of bull market tops
but another reason is different from the pi cycle top indicator is because the pi cycle top indicator is essentially two moving averages, but this right here, these are not moving averages
in fact, both of these lines are derived from bitcoin's on chain metrics
and so this orange line right here, which is currently the line on top, is known as the balanced price
and this pink line, which is currently the one underneath, is known as the cvdd, which stands for the cumulative value of coin days destroyed, which for the most part, measures how quickly coins are moving on the bitcoin blockchain
and so usually during the bull market, we see a lot of activity happening on the bitcoin blockchain, which spikes these onchain metrics
and then during the more boring times in the market, or the bear market, we see these onchain metrics fall slightly flat while there's less activity happening on the bitcoin blockchain compared to the bull markets
and historically speaking, we've seen the two previous bitcoin bear market bottoms i'm talking about, the 2014 bear market bottom and the 2018 bear market bottom bottom out at around these two lines right here
and in fact, the bottom comes into play when these two lines cross over
and if you're looking at these two lines right now, in fact, if i zoom in even closer, they are getting very close to crossing over, but they haven't crossed just yet, which means we might not necessarily be at a bottom, at least just yet, according to this indicator right here, but we're technically getting very close
and if you're looking at what bitcoin price these two lines are currently coming in at right now, one of them's coming in at around 16 and a half thousand, and other ones coming in at around 17 and a half thousand
so most likely they're going to cross somewhere around 17 000
and once again, historically speaking, we've seen a bitcoin bear market bottom coming into play right around these two lines right here
and as the two lines are crossing over, so potentially somewhere around 17k, give or take
but if we're looking at the bitcoin order books across these massive exchanges right now, we have a lot of buy orders coming into play at around 20 000 per bitcoin, which is pretty much the literal definition of support coming to play at twenty thousand dollars per bitcoin
because in order for the bitcoin price to drop below twenty thousand, we need to see a lot more sellers that are selling to all of these buy orders that are placed at twenty thousand dollars per bitcoin before the price can go any lower
and taking a quick look at the shortterm bitcoin price action
and right now, technically speaking, we still have this active bullish divergence, but it's getting close to potentially invalidating, because if the 4hour bitcoin rsi starts breaking this shortterm uptrend, then that would essentially invalidate this bullish divergence
but once again, you can clearly see that we do have strong supports coming into play at around twenty thousand dollars per bitcoin, at least in the shorter term
and now getting into the ethereum part of this video, this right here is the weekly ethereum chart
and obviously, right now, the weekly ethereum rsi is still at record low levels
right now, ethereum has never been more oversold in terms of the weekly ethereum rsi
and as for some important levels of support, we still have this 382 fibonacci level coming into play at around 1050, give or take
and it is really important for the price of ethereum to hold above 1 000 per ethereum, because basically if ethereum drops below 1000, then we could start seeing more liquidations occur in the d5 space, which could result in more ethereum getting dumped onto the markets
and so once again, around that 1 000 mark for ethereum is an important price level to watch, because we could see a bit of a liquidation event if we go below that level
and just checking the short term ethereum price action here on the four hour chart, technically we still have this slight bullish divergence that is getting close to invalidation already
but at least as of right now, at the time of recording this video, the ethereum, for our rsi, has not yet broken this shortterm uptrend, which technically means this shortterm bullish divergence could still play out over the next few days, which means reduced bearish momentum, most likely choppy, sideways price action
and just taking a quick look at the ethereum versus bitcoin charity on the weekly time frame, nothing much has happened since yesterday
once again, we still have this important upwards turning line of support coming into play at around 0049 bitcoin per ethereum
and as of right now, at least in the shorter term, we have seen a bit of a shortterm bounce for bitcoin versus ethereum
but based on the current situation, and based on what we've seen in the previous 2018 bear market for ethereum, it is more likely than unlikely for ethereum versus bitcoin to break below this upper chain line of support
considering the fact that this is obviously not just a horizontal level of support, it is trending to the upside
which means in order for ethereum to hold above this line of support moving forward, would basically have to see ethereum consistently outperform bitcoin moving forward, which did not happen at all in the last 2018 bear markets
so overall, for the larger trends, at the moment here on the weekly charts, i am remaining more bearish than bullish for ethereum versus bitcoin, which basically means i do expect ethereum to continue to underperform against bitcoin, especially while the overall crypto market and the stock market are still trending to the downside
but as for the super long term future for ethereum, talking about five to ten years from now, i am much more bullish for ethereum in the longer term
this is just talking about potentially the next few months or so
and if you found this video useful, definitely check out this video popping up right here
if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
all right, everyone, welcome back to another ta episode on bitcrane
in today's episode, bitcoin fomc fractal, i'm going to be talking about an interesting fractal that i see panning out from the last fomc meeting, which is exactly panning out once again today
i did talk about this on my twitter so i just wanted to make a quick update with what i see, what to expect next
if you do want to know why this is going to be my only update, uh, if you do want to keep up with my updates when i'm not posting on youtube, then be sure to stick around to the latter half of this video, as i'll just be doing a quick disclaimer before we wrap up the video
but nonetheless, i'm going gonna do it towards the end, because i imagine most people want to see the ta rather than the disclaimer
now, if we look back at what happened at the previous fomc meeting, this was over on the 4th of may, we increased the interest rates by 50 basis points, and we subsequently massively, massively bounded to the downside
we had almost a 45 drop up until yesterday, where we had a bounce in the markets
now, tons of people getting out, better getting out of bed from this move
i said, this is one of the clearest bull traps i've seen in a while
and i also shared this image of this fractal, which is what i'm going to be talking about today
now, if we look at what happened in the last fomc fractal, we had bad news
obviously, raising the interest rates is not bullish for the market whatsoever
you can see price went up after the news because we basically priced in the interest rate increase
and at this moment in time, the fed are feeling very hawkish about inflation, meaning that month after month over month, they're very likely to keep on increasing the interest rates
and until the interest rates start to subside, until the fed back pedals, which has been basically the motto of my channel for the past two months now, until the fed back pedals, the bottom is not in
i've been saying this day after day after day, week after week after week
so what happened yesterday? because, like i said, a lot of people got out of bed for this bounce
we increased by 75 basis points, which was basically exactly what we predicted over here in the fomc update
now, this is when i said, you know, this is a super, super obvious bear trap
uh? i wasn't active on my youtube yesterday because i was busy
and you can already see that we are starting to massively, massively landslide to the downside
you know, this bounce to this low high was what people were getting out of bed for, and now we're already pushing back down to the downside
now, in my opinion, we probably should expect lower price targets
i don't want to run through all of my price targets for this video, because my macro price targets are unchanged from yesterday's video
now, if you do want my full thoughts of everything that's going on in the markets, if you want a macro, oh, if you want a macro update over on my perspective on the old crane market, be sure to check out the total cryptocurrency market blues
this is going to be relevant to solana ethereum, move to earns, you know, every, every single crane that you could possibly want, uh, it's going to be generalized in that video
now, i am going to be jumping back into singular old crane videos tomorrow, and i'll explain why i'm not doing that today
but nonetheless, if you do want my old crane update, then be sure to check out this video
if you do want my thoughts of what was going to happen after the fomc meeting, which was exactly what we predicted right here
and if you want my macro price targets on bitcoin, which are once again, completely unchanged, it is this video
last six hours, i talked about three very important charts and what to expect next over in the price action
now i'm not gonna run through why i think these prices are coming to fruition, because i would just be regurgitating this video
however, my macro price targets, in order from most conservative to most bearish, are, eighteen thousand, five hundred, sixteen thousand, five hundred and 000, which i do not believe 14 000 is coming into fruition
but like i said, i'm not gonna run through all of these charts, talking about every price target, because i would simply be regurgitating yesterday's video, and that's not what i want to do
so, uh, like i said, this is the exact fractal that we're seeing playing out right now
one thing i would like to say is, if we zoom out on the elliott waves, i've talked about this before, but, you know, we already have had our five wave impulse from this bull run
so we are obviously moving into a bearish phase right now, bear market, whatever you want to call it
we've had our a, b, and we're currently in the c, which, if you know elliot wave, is the last wave to the downside
now there are five, or rather, there are three bearish impulses in the five wave back to the downside
when you're having your a bearish impulse, and you'll see bearish impulse
so you can see, we've had our one bearish impulse, correctory phase, three bearish impulse, correctory phase
and right now i do very, very much believe that we are getting very, very close to the bottom
does this mean that we can't have one last absolutely brutal capitulation? no, it doesn't, because that is actually what i'm predicting
i do think we're getting ready for that one last capitulation to the downside, uh, before we do start to reverse
in my opinion, the reason why we pumped into the basis point increase is because the bearish news of the basis point increase was basically already priced into the market
if you study basic economists, if you study basic economy, um, if you study basic economics, that's such a hard word to say for me
if you study that, then you'll understand it was very black and white
how we were able to predict the 75 basis point increase? you know, inflation was running rampant
it was very, very obvious we were going to see that 75 basis point increase
however, what is not priced into the market, which is what i believe we are about to currently price into the market is the fed's hawkish perspective on the markets now
because the feds are extremely hawkish right now, meaning that they are committed to raising interest rates meeting after meeting after meeting
so we were expecting that increase, uh, interest rate increase
but now we are, in my opinion, probably going to start pricing in the next fomc meeting, which, you know, it's only been a day or so, and we're already getting some more inflation numbers from europe, where inflation is still running rampant
so, you know, obviously, at this moment in time, it's been one day since the last fomc meeting, we really can't predict what is going to be happening in the next fomc meeting, just like back here
you know, it was, it would have been impossible, well, you know, it was kind of obvious, but it would have been hard to predict what was happening today, uh, or yesterday of the fomc, it was obvious to predict what was going on after the cpi numbers came out somewhere around about here
so, you know, once again, this is something else i said on twitter, keep one eye on the inflation numbers, keep your others, keep your other eye on the fed, until the fed starts backpedaling
and the fed is not going to do that until inflation starts going down
and here is the video where i run through all of my macro charts over on btc
i would also like to show you the bitcoin dominance is still in extreme strength
uh, you know, it's had many, many, many corrections while it's been on this rampage to the upside
you can see this one was even more brutal than what we just saw
now, this was just a quick capitulation, within these previous capitulations, from our fib from our low to the high, we came right back down into this orange box, which constitutes the most important range of fibonaccis, from the 05 fibonacci to the 786, and obviously encompassing the golden pocket, the 618 fib between them
so i really don't see, uh, the bitcoin dominance going any lower than, once again, 4298
and even then, i i would be very surprised if we didn't do something like this or this, rather than coming all the way down to these lower prices
however, like i said, bitcoin dominance still on a massive rampage
if we do come over to the old crane market cap, once again, i've been saying this for months now, it is not the time to dca alt cranes
if you zoom back into previous market structures, it is you you just do not hold the 786 fibonaccis in in bear markets, like you can see from the last bull run, we capitulated below the 786
had one last macro capitulation for the old cranes before the bottom is in
and you know, once again, if you're a seasoned veteran to my channel, you know that no matter what old crane we've been covering, we've been very, very patient
i've been sitting on the sidelines for months now, and this is really starting to pay off
while these old cranes are massively, massively capitulating, bear in mind, if you think what we've seen so far is bad
the bitcoin dominance has not even really started its macro move yet
once this breaks, and if it breaks below 396 billion, which, in my opinion, i do believe it will, this would represent another 16 drop, or 77 billion of the old crane market cap wiped out
before the next massive, massive leg to the downside, then what you can expect is the bitcoin dominance to start going on a massive ran your old cranes to get wrecked
and once again, i've been very, very busy the past couple of days, so i haven't had time to update all the old coins, i know, but some of people in the discord are asking me, you know, can you update tron? uh, hbar waves, jasmine, elon, doge, uh, what are some others? uh, fitfire, gmt, gst eight
the fact of the matter is, you know, yes, we've had a lot of dead cat bounces on these charts
like, for example, if we look at what's going on on green satoshi token, uh, we did have, you know, somewhat of an okay bounce
i do not have any different perspectives over on the old queen market cap
but you know my perspective, i think bitcoin is going down to lower levels once bitcoin, and in my opinion, it will, once bitcoin breaks below the previous alltime high at 19 800 to 20 000, you can expect that last capitulation for bitcoin
and if you have been watching my videos, then you will know that bitcoin bottoms before old cranes
bitcoin always does something like this, where it has its low, it comes up for a massive, massive bounce
oh, old cranes outperform bitcoin for a couple of weeks to a month or so, and then bitcoin comes down and it makes a higher low
and while bitcoin's making that higher low, what the old cranes actually do is something like this, you know, they have their bounce, and then they come down for a lower low
and they normally capitulate sideways for a prolonged period of time
once again, if you're a seasoned veteran to my channel, then you would have been very privy of that information anyway
and this is once again hammering in the fact that, you know, people think now is the only time you can buy alt cranes
even after bitcoin bottomed, ethereum came down another 40 against bitcoin
this even happened with cryptos like ada, which were massive, massive outperformers
you can see some of these went sideways against their bitcoin pairs after the bitcoin bottom, for 784 days
now, am i saying it's going to play out exactly as it did previously? absolutely not
we've got a completely different geopolitical geist of things going on in the economy
because, for example, i was here in 2018, and there are so many more bearish signals going on in the crypto market right now than what was going on back then? you know, we didn't have the lunar ponzi schemes getting rock pooled
we didn't have, you know, um, well, we did have, you know, the sec going after a bunch of securities
but now they're going after xrp, which, in my opinion, is not, is not a security, even though i don't like it, uh
i mean, you know, once again, if you've researched, uh, the security laws, if you've researched the sec case versus howie cohen, if you understand the howie test, then you should be very, very knowledgeable on what a security is
if your cryptocurrencies had an initial crane offering, then your cryptocurrency is most likely security
and that is what binance ethereum, and pretty much all of these cryptocurrencies are, you know, solana, uh, i don't necessarily, i haven't researched, um, i was, i was about to say cryptocom but i don't know if they've got an initial coin offering, but, uh, once again, let's wrap up the video at this point
you know, my macro price targets, i said them at the start of this video, i think bitcoin is either heading down to eighteen thousand five hundred, most conservative, sixteen thousand five hundred, this is where i think bitcoin is actually going to bottom
once again, if you do want my opinion on why all of these charts, uh, or if you want my opinion on what, where these numbers specifically come from, then check out this video now, uh, wrapping up the video
and i've got really, really neat cable management, so probably the most amount of time i'm going to spend is unplugging all the cables and then replugging them back in at some point in time
i've got to move my desk, my monitor, my keyboard, my mouse, my computer
but yeah, like i said, this is going to be my only video today
now, if you do want to keep up with my updates on the crypto markets
then be sure to head over to my twitter because, you know, like i said, the twitter gets most of my updates, first on what i consider time sensitive information
like i said, i told you last night, you know, this was a almost 2 am where i live, and it's now 3 pm, so it's been about 13 hours since i posted
you know, i reconfirmed this today, talking about the snapshot of the fomc meeting
and also, i am going to be posting, you know, information that i do see as relevant over on here
so for example, yesterday i said, uh, if you go over to my community tab, you'll see that i said, you know, just a quick reminder that i'm going to be busy, uh, go over to my twitter if you want the updates
and here, over on my twitter is where i do my updates when i'm away from my computer, or i cannot be doing these updates
so that being said, if you do want to follow me over on twitter, is here at 618 on the school cowboy
so if you do want me to cover, you know, your favorite old crane, bear in mind, i only have so much time
and i physically just cannot just fit every move to earn, every old crane, every bitcoin video, the bitcoin dominance, the news updates
however, if you leave your comments down below of the old cranes that you want to watch the most, then the ones with the most likes, the ones with the most requests, the most requests that i have over on my discord are the ones that i will be covering first
as i said, the last three videos i've made will tell you everything you need to know from what to expect next in the old crane market
once again, this was one day ago, and this is already aging well
uh, the fomc meeting update where we predicted the 75 basis point increase, you know, this has been and gone, but if you want my thoughts on that and go check it out
there is nothing to update other than that i believe this fractal is going to be playing out to the teeth, and i think we're getting ready for that last leg to the downside, just like we've been predicting for the past couple of months
we're seeing prices that most thought we would never see again, yet here we are
so is this capitulation i see there in the question marks, uh, or at least in the comments? well, very possibly
so let's just take a step back and see where we are relative to what is currently going on
so very important i've mentioned on the previous shows up here
you have the orange 255 moving average, also on the weekly scale
if this tags this area, or even comes below on a week basis, i would be loading up, at least just for a leaf bounce, you know, for a dead cat bounce
when you zoom out, i'll just give you a bit of perspective of where we at
and now covert was a once off opportunity, right? so you don't see this every day
then we went straight through that, wicked right through that area, pulled back up, came back down the next week to test it again
so anything within this zone, i would say, is a golden opportunity to be loading up
i would probably not be taking leveraged trades in this area over here, not until you have more confirmation and things slow down a bit like that
i mentioned on my twitter that uh, i would explain how to handle the capitulation type of environment, and from in the experience that i went through
well, what happened was, i was watching this price action live back in 2020, and i actually put everything that i had in, uh at 4 400, which, in relation to this candle, is pretty much boom, right over there
each sort of hundred dollar move results in multiple percentage either gain or loss in your portfolio
but when that's your entire net worth, those, those are radical numbers
so my advice to anybody who has been sitting on the sidelines with a whole lot of money, ready to buy the dip, if you do get that sort of opportunity, use money that you aren't planning on touching for years, uh? because we don't know what's going to happen
we could go much, much lower, but at least for some sort of a snap back to the mean, as a mean reversion trade, you could make some good gains
but you got to put that money away, out of sight, out of mind, for, i would say, at least a couple of months, to even a few years, and just sit back and make peace with what you've done if you are going to attempt to buy the dip over here
so if we have a look at where we at right now, bear in mind the environment is very different
because back then, they announced quantitative easing straight afterwards, which stimulated the entire market
and if you take from the 21 ema, the drawdown to where we at right now, we've moved almost 45 away from that region
now this is at least for some sort of a snapback to the next area of resistance
and when we had this candle over here, number five, i did say the same thing
i bought over there, and we had a nice big move back to the upside
as soon as i get off of this, off of the stream, i'm probably going to be setting my orders
i might buy a couple of spot positions right now where we at, and i'll continue to ladder in as we go down, because i think this is the moment
and the reason that i say that is, if you have a look over here, it's wednesday
that's going to be followed up by the employment and unemployment rates as well as jerome powell's speech
and then when you listen to that, we're going to see whether he is hawkish or if he's going to be slightly dovish to give some sort of relief to the market
i would not get my hopes up thinking that he's going to, just because the markets are tanking, that he's going to care and be dovish
so when you also have a look at the total market cap over here, which i outlined in yesterday's newsletter, you can see we're entering right into that liquidity zone
so this is the time where you have to put your money where your mouth is
so since 47k, i've been telling everybody to be out of the market
now it's getting to the time where everybody's starting to panic
once you start to see sub 20 000, uh, it could get wild quickly
for a bounce of 19, i don't know if we'll wake straight down to 14, 15 k
believe it or not, those levels are not as far away as you think
we have total two you can see we're entering, also, right into the liquidity zone
i'm still waiting for that move to the lower trend line, which i think we will get if bitcoin truly starts to capitulate
it's another 21 move and then we will hit that diagonal trend line, which will be an area of interest for me
and long term, yes, we could still make it down to these much lower regions, which on bitcoin, will mark about the 12 13k level
realistically, i don't think that's going to happen in one single day
looking at the dexi over here, you can see that it has wicked far above it's pulled back ever since
who knows, probably whatever's going to happen with today's fomc results is either going to push this straight back up into a full body candle, or it's going to stay as a weak and close below you
i already told you guys on ages ago in other videos, that i'm targeting this key quarterly level, which marks up with the precovert dump zones, which is coming in in this zone over here
i mean, there's a little bit of liquidity and support over here where maybe it was weak through today
but ultimately, we're probably coming down to those levels on the nasdaq
so on the fourhour chart over here, you can see entering into the main liquidity zone again
i'm going to be buying at least for some sort of a snapback, whether it meets underside resistance at 29 000, and then i will lay off some
maybe it will be even lower than that, but i would expect something like this
and then i'll load all of those spot positions off in that zone again, expecting that we're eventually going to make our way back down to the 12 000 level
i know a lot of you are stuck in longterm positions that you've been in in like huddle positions
when you look at this chart and you say, well, this is not, if this weren't bitcoin, um, this is just a any other chart, then what do you see here? i mean, this is going to be your next levels, right? there's literally no support over here
when we had, uh, 20k in the 2017, in the 2017 market, right? so let me zoom into that for you
so weekly candle closes, we had eighteen thousand nine hundred dollars once it closed there
uh? and then we've got this over here, which was the start of the next run where everything really started to take off
covert came up over here once we started to majorly break out
now tell me, do you honestly think that we're going to bounce from here and just rally on to or new alltime highs? like i i don't think so
personally, i'm willing to take a bid here based off of a bounce scenario
so hoping that it will bounce out of these zones over here, but then i would ultimately expect that we're going to come back down to this level over here
and if you want to get really, really sticky about where the main level would be with the most support, you're going to be looking, truthfully, at about twelve thousand dollars
this is your main support i'll make it a bit darker, and you can take a screenshot of that if you want to
so that is going to be your main support area, is going to be coming in between 10 and 12 000
i would love if it did, because then we capitulate, and then it's over
and then you have, hopefully, a vshape recovery, similar to covert
now, looking at the momentum oscillators, let me go into four hour charts
okay, they are at the bottom, but they can stay there much longer than you think
so remember, the market can remain irrational longer than you, as a trader can remain solvent

how is everyone doing today? hope you're all doing absolutely fantastic
let's take a look at the price of bitcoin and see what's going on here
because we have had a big, big, major drop here on bitcoin from yesterday to today
why did we have that fall here on bitcoin? make sure to smash up that like button, and let's analyze the situation here right away to see what is going on
we do have a very interesting meeting today at eight o'clock central european time, which is the funk meeting
at half eight, which is central european time, i'm probably going to do a live stream to check out the volatility, uh, at those levels, if we can find some opportunities
and of course, you know, let's just zoom in here on to what we mentioned yesterday
first of all, i'm going to talk about my trade that i did take yesterday
all right? and also why i didn't trade over here, because we could see this kind of price action, right? some people are calling it an inverse head and shoulder with a descending neckline
uh, you know, the bezel looks like it was kind of getting exhausted
we finally rolled back down to retest the lows, even slightly dipped below this range
i think there was a lot of speculation for a potential reversal here
no trade is a winning trade, remember? so, you know, we were at these levels we were talking about, you know, i did say, i'm not taking any longs, you know, then this could actually have a pop here to the upside for a bigger reversal, or we can roll down to retest the lows
we were talking about this trade when i did the live stream yesterday
we were talking about, you know, i mean, this is not a bad shorting opportunity right over here, because, um, the risk to reward is, is, is pretty, pretty high
the risk to reward from this short position, you know, was, was pretty high if you were to take this short, okay, to actually come in, you know, take profits at the lows
you know, if you were getting into trade when i did the live stream yesterday, we were trading at this zone
so we, we also had the major daily level that we have been talking about
all right, in december of 2020, you know, for any new subscribers, you know, let's just zoom out here on the four hourly, on the daily, actually, let's take a look at those daily levels
all right? these two green horizontal lines, okay? these are daily levels, because back in december of 2020, we had major resistance, okay? had major daily closes and opens, as you can see, on the 19th, on the 20th, on on the 22nd, on the 23rd
and also a big, major support level, you know, here closing and opening, also on the 21st and 22nd of december
now, if we zoom, okay, if we go fast forward here on the one hourly to see what is happening with these two levels, they have been very much respected, okay? they are important levels from back of 2020
uh, so, you know, if over two years ago, uh, these major levels you can see here, once we broke down
okay, these are the two green levels that i'm talking about, the daily ones from december of 2020, well respected as resistance, well respected as support, well respected as resistance once we dipped below the lows of december of 2020
so what was happening yesterday? you know, that looks like the price wants to make a reversal
so, um, yeah, probabilities in actually going slightly to the downside, uh, to the downside, to retest as low as higher
so yesterday we were talking about, you know, this is a a three to one risk to reward trade, you know, approximately more or less
you know, you stop loss above this major wick, you know, entering right there, you know, you do have this risk to reward, which was pretty high
i was a little, you know, i did take a trade right over here, from this, from this level, okay? shorted it all the way down here
i've got, you know, confirmation here with these candlesticks, on the one hourly that it is strong support
and also with this one hourly candlestick, having the wick and closing below and having this consolidation
this is why i actually took this short, okay, at the 22 700 area
um, what else? well, it was the 618 from this major drop, you know, from this, you know, drop over here
and from the top bit to the low part, you know, we were actually consolidating at that 61865 fibonacci, which was perfect
so that was a short position that i took, and i took profits here
why did i take profit? because it was the 618 from this impulsive move
wasn't a huge amount, but it had pretty nice volume to the upside, looking at the lower time frames
and, yeah, it was just a good level to take profits, in my opinion
and then yesterday, when we did the live stream, i mentioned i got stopped out from this level
and, um, and we will talk about what could potentially happen right now
i just want to talk, you know, do a quick overview of what happened yesterday
so, um, yeah, basically right over here, we can see, you know, this major level
uh, you know, we had the shorting opportunity, uh, or or no trade, and i decided to take no trade
the risk to reward on this short, to retest these lows, was pretty high
so that was a pretty, pretty good trade, um, but i did not take it
so it would there was actually a really nice harmonic pattern here that i did see, uh, just about an hour ago when i was doing the analysis here, ready for the live stream
this is a, you know, day trades, these are small, these are scalp day trades
let me just show you here this gartley pattern that played out beautifully
if we go to the 30 minute chart, you can probably even see it even better
where we did have, you know, this leg from the lows that we did create yesterday to the highs
we've got this movement, then this one right over here, hitting the 618
and also, you had this one creating a lower high and then coming down below this low area
did i take this trade? no, this happened, you know, uh, late last night
you know, it took about approximately four or five hours to reach the target
let me explain this gartly bullish harmonic pattern right away, right away
i don't mind missing trades, because i'll jump in another trade, you know, at some point it doesn't matter
i've had an insane, insane month of june, really, really good trades
you don't need to over trade, especially, especially if you're in in good profits
so what we did over here yesterday is a garlic, bullish garlic pattern, from this low to the high wick over here, to the low area here, hitting that 618 level, hitting also right over here, the 618 level
from this impulsive move to the downside, up to the 618 again, creating that lower high and coming down, guess where, to the 079
all fibonacci levels are being respected, as you can see on the chart
and if i pull out the gauntlet pattern here, you can see that that point, seven, eight, seven nine, you know, seven, eight, seven nine, within crypto is a little bit volatile
i put the 079 here, 0786, hitting that d point, having that perfect pump
you even had a small consolidation here on the 30minute chart
this was, uh, i would have taken this trade if i would have seen it, of course, um, i didn't
i was sleeping, but, um, yeah, it was a, there was a really, really nice trade
and where is this? where is the target for this bullish harmonic pattern? it's only a day trade
you can see here, from c right there, this sea level, beautiful
where did the price action stop? it stopped beautifully at the 618
if you want to add more confluence, you have big, big, um vpvr levels right at that level
the strongest vpvr level is right there underneath the 22 300
you don't, you do not think this is going to have a massive, impulsive move to the upside
but it's a take profit area where you do have strong resistance
that's, you know, it's already a take profit area on a harmonic pattern from c to d, always
and what else do you have as confluence? what else is telling you that you have big, major resistance here? and probably a lot of you might know already by looking at the chart, you have this huge resistance trend line from the lower highs, which is exactly at this level
i mean, this is a pump of, what, two percent? i don't know how much it is, but it's not much
but if you, oh, it's actually a four percent move, almost a five percent move to the upside
so, um, you know, if you're using a bit of leverage, you know, you're using a 10x or 20x when you're doing scalping day trade, i use in between 15 and 25 x
i might start using a little bit of, of, you know, that amount of leverage if i'm in a very, very nice trade
but, yeah, you're just using a 20x leverage, you actually making 100 gains on this small, little move
and this was a kind of a must, must, long, you know, beautiful, guardly, bullish, guardly pattern, you know, hitting that point, 78, 78, 79 to perfection
i mean, this was, this was an absolute winner, absolute winning trade
i mean, just, let's take a look at the rsi because, and i'm going to go through the comment section right away
let's just take a look at the rsi because it's, um, yeah, with it bullish divergence right over here
it's not my favorite indicator, but it's showing you like, a kind of a exhaustion
is this a descending wedge scenario? i mean, this could be a descending wedge scenario
um, so it's, it's in the cards for a potential small, bigger reverse
uh, let's go back to the 30 minute chart, do some short term analysis
we about hitting the six one eight levels from this major drop
looking at the 30 minute um, can this get resistance from the trend line and the six one eight and have another reversal here, to potentially come down and almost retest the lows, or retest the lows here
i would wait, let's see how we consolidate at this range uh in the next couple of hours
it might be a good shorting opportunity, but it can also be a good bullish one
um, i would be extremely cautious a level where we could get rejected here, because a lot of people are bullish on a breakout, right? a lot of people get bullish on a breakout of a resistance trendline or a support trendline
but we need a, we need to know that from the volume traded the last few days, the biggest point of control is right over here at the 22 300, 22 400
so what happens a lot of the times is that you have some bullish momentum, you stop at the last lower high, at the biggest point of control
people are bullish because you've broken a lower high trend line, and then you have a reversal point
so if we do fail to break this level in the next coming hours, you know, if we do get up there, it might be a good shorting opportunity, at least, to around about the 50 618 from this pump, there is a potential nice trade here
if we do get that leg up, you know, i will be interested in shorting that pump to this 22, 300 range
uh, for the moment, there is a possibility that we are going to get rejected from this 618 level currently, just hit that range, above this range, getting huge rejection
it's also possibility to get a correction here to this low level right over here, and probably create a higher low
i am still in my trade here on natural gas and crude oil on primix vt
what is happening with the dxy? dxy has got a perfect retest and consolidation from this higher low breakout
okay, this high low support breakout, coming back up, testing the highs, even breaking it
if dxy continues to pump um, bitcoin is doomed to go even lower
i think, you know, major consolidation, a larger correction on the dxy
i'm not sure if we are going to successfully, you know, continue back going much, much higher on the dxy
let me know in your opinion, uh, your opinion in the comment section
what do you think about the dxy? i'll be going through the the comment section right now
s p 500 is finding a little bit of support from lowe's created here back in march of 2021
we were actually a few points below that potential target, then had a major drop
i did not trade this, but we can trade many other things and make profits
uh, i'm gonna go through many many comments right now, at this moment, 640 people watching at this moment
i got this, uh, this was a video from natural gas, looking for that distribution event
let's absolutely all together right now in the next two seconds, before i go through the comment section, to scroll down the video and absolutely destroy that like button
um, trx, guys, i'm not sure if trx i got my man joseph, one of my strongest moderators, actually, in an insane short position on trx
we did take a look at trx on a live stream just a few days ago, when i did see someone in the comment section saying, you know, trx is holding the range pretty nicely
and we were talking about this right over here we are the resistance trend line from these lower highs, you know, creating a kind of a double top, failed attempt
and when we did the live stream, we were around about these levels, and, you know, we had an ascendant, this ascending channel here, and it was just very likely to continue this descending triangle pattern
you know, trx is very likely to come down to retest the lows here, the base of this descending triangle, which is the summer lows of 2021
you know, it's just very likely going to have that major drop
it had a 50 drop since, you know, we were, we were talking about the probabilities in this actually breaking down this ascending channel and coming down to retest, you know, over a 40 drop, 40, 45 drop
so, you know, whoever took that trade, i did not take that trade
i'm, i'm focused more on bitcoin only, uh, maybe ethereum, maybe some altcoin once in a while
for the competition, i will be trading all coins, no doubt about that, because the, you know, the percentage gains can be huge
you only need one, two, you know, markets to make huge gains, guys
absolutely beautiful um to the to to the support level where we are getting this, this reaction, we are getting the reaction here at this, you know, four, five cent range, uh, five cent level, uh, dropping to that range
this is the thing, you know, with these all coins, you don't hit exact levels
but you can see here, this channel was very much respected, you know, from the beginning of january, creating the low, high, low, high, very respected channel, you know, slightly fake house to the upside, to the downside
you've got a major base, okay, to retest as as um as the resistance level
you know, having that projected move from this ascending channel hitting the resistance of this lower high trend line, descending triangle, it was poised to to to come down and retest this five cent level
i did not take the trade, unfortunately, because, yeah, i mean, i'm just looking at other markets, doing live streams, um, let me take a look at the superchat here right away, from david lee, hi
member 130, i have got exactly 132 people inside of the private team
but i i thought that we were just about going to reach 10, 15 or 20 members
if you are interested to absolutely crush it here in the competition for some huge gains
okay? people that are not inside of my team will be kicked out
okay? because that telegram group is only for the 20 days that the competition is live, from the 27th of june until the 17th of july
people that want to join there and not in the team will be kicked out because i will be asking for the numbers, of course
i will be asking for people to to prove that they are in the team
sorry, but this is only an exclusive group that will be open for 20 days
once the 20 days of the competition happens, it will, the group will be eliminated
i had, i made huge gains on gmt the last, um, the last few couple of months, actually
i started trading gmt back in april, um, so, yeah, a couple of months
the last level that we've got here on gmt analysis is this huge daily level
okay, holding it nicely as support, creating kind of a massive, big descending triangle here, and finally breaking down, you know
and when we break down from such a big level, we want to find out where the price can stop
and here in gmt, we had one stop at 69 cents approximately, and the second stop here round about the 57 cents
i think it is very likely that gmt is going to come down to retest the 43 cents next okay, especially bitcoin does continue to the downside
look at this solid close and open on the daily big support level
where is the price getting a reaction? exactly at that daily level
we got a beautiful i mean, we've got insane trades here, happening on on gmt
if i would have traded gmt these levels, i would have made huge gains, huge gains, because it is respecting these levels
sometimes how simple technical analysis and good risk management, you know, can make me, can make you huge, huge gains
we got this low created on the 20th of march, and this low created on the 25th of march
we don't want to have a headache with, you know, 10 different indicators on the chart
we want to, you know, trade level to level with a good risk management
okay? these are levels from march of 2022, just three months ago
you know, this is this, this box, white box that i got in this daily level
if i zoom in, look how these we have been trading beautifully, level to level
that what level? the 69 cents, the 70 cents level right there
where are we going to stop? this is where what we need to find out as traders, where can the price stop? where can the price get a bounce? exactly at this day level on the from the 21 20th of march
if you consolidate at this major support level, it's up to you to take that long, uh, where are you gonna aim to to take profits on the long? well, you're gonna aim to this major resistance level
you know, from these highs to the lows, you you can, you know, 50 percent, aim for the 50 percent lock some profits
you are very, very likely going to get rejected from this major level
so if you are longing this, you're taking profits here, and you're also entering a new short to aim to retest these lows
we are, you know, from yesterday to today, we got rejected from this level
so, okay, just a quick overview of what has happened on gmt and take a look at major levels
what are the opportunities on gmt right now? well, like i said, you know, do you know? do you know that we are gonna, are we gonna pump from this range, or are we gonna absolutely drop? and this is the question, this is the, you know, million dollar question
you know, if we do have an insane drop on gmt, um most important level for me would be this 40 cent range, in between 40 and 42 level
if gmt does drop to that level, i would be interested in looking for a pretty nice long position
and i'm telling you already, if we do lose this range, it will have a pretty aggressive drop
so you can either wait for a confirmed breakout, wait for a consolidation and hop in a trade
because the impulsive move to the downside to this level is just gonna be very, very likely to be very fast
and it's going to happen, because the price movement up from 40 cents all the way up to 58 cents has been very, very fast
where do you have large consolidation, where do you have volume traded? you know, from that 40 cent level
so that would be a good, interesting long position here on, on this level
so if you are, um, i'm not going to say in a responsible trader, you can speculate that this is going to go down there
no, i will not jump in any trade on, you know, until i see confirmation, until i see a revisit of these levels
if we do have a larger bounce here, or for of an abc kind of movement on gmt hitting their 79, 80 cent range, which is a huge, huge level zone, i would be very much interested in shorting this
yeah, i would be looking, if i take fibonacci from the last drop created on the 9th, 8th of june, the major highs, this is a large consolidation
so you want to take your fib levels from the top here, from this drop
okay? you don't take fib levels from here, from here, or or from here
you know, you take it from here, from the last big impulsive move
if you take a look at fib levels from this level, guys, remember, i'm we're not here to to to predict where we're going
we're here to pre to to find out where we do have big levels to take a trading opportunity
i am here to take a look at the levels for shorting off a longing and knowing how to have risk management and just take the trade
so if we take a look at this high to the loader, you know, this is a good, good, um, fibonacci, um, impulsive move
you know, you need to take a look at the the fib levels from this impulsive move here, looking at the four hourly
at 79 cents, six, one, eight is all the way about 80, 86 cents
but if it does in the next couple of days, in between 50 and 618, is already a potential shorting opportunity
looking at fib levels in between 79 cents and 86 cents, looking at gmt
so we've got confluence number one, these fib levels, 679 cents to 86 cents
and what else do we have? we have a major, major zone where we have been respecting it exactly at the 80 cent level
we've got another one right over here, from these lower highs
this is going to be around this range in between, you know, you know, in the next couple of days, if we do have that leg up, it's going to be a strong, strong resistance zone
if we come all the way up here and start making a funny consolidation, just like we are doing here, we do make that price action there, bring it on, because i will be shorting this
guys, it does look like that the continuation to the downside is imminent
you know, i'm either shorting the 79 cents, or i'm either longing the 40 cents
gmt, matter of fact, i've got an alarm here, actually, i did set an alert at 77 cents to see if we were gonna have that leg up
so i will put another alarm here around about 42 cents, just before we hit 40 cents
once i get the alert, i will be notified on my phone, and i will be looking for that potential trade, see how we react at these levels
anyway, that's the those are the major levels that i'm looking here on gmt, thanks david for the super chat
um, um, well, i want to go through most of the comments, but, yeah, we're doing trading analysis here for the community, so no time to read all of the comments, unfortunately
has an insane team, insane, you know, partners, uh, investors
i think it's one of, it's going to be one of those those altcoins that does very, very well in in the future
so what have we got? what have we got here on kadena? [Music]
uh, it's starting to look pretty pretty nice for accumulation
uh, i think we're gonna have more time, though, if bitcoin does have a little bit more downside, uh, or sideways action, you know, this is going to be, in my opinion, several months
i think cadena is one of those l1 that will recover nicely in the next bull run
and this chart is a really, really nice, you know, is if we are going to be trading the next one to two months around these levels, you know, i would, i would, you know, confidently say that the floor is in, uh, for for cadena
you know, you are already about 20 x almost, from the alltime high, uh, alltime high
but it's a pretty pretty solid project, in my opinion, blockchain project
now, the reason why we are consolidating, we are finding a floor level here, is because we do have a pretty, pretty strong daily support level right over here
so this is the reason why we had a nice daily and open on cadena at this range
you could speculate, okay, if you do lose this level, which is, let me just, let me just mark this level to the exact um, the exact, uh zone
the close here on cadena 139, just to put this on the 139, to the exact daily close, and zoom in on the full hourly chart
and, you know, you look at this, i mean, this is absolute magic
these major levels, i my favorite levels are the daily and weekly
look how insanely the, the the market has respected this low created in september of 2021, bouncing beautifully from this zone
let me just take a look at the low here, to the exact, you know, yeah, it was a one, one cent, one cent off
we are in a pretty, pretty aggressive downtrend at this moment
you know, the possibilities here of a double bottom is very, very high
you know, who knows, you might be creating an adam and eve situation
here, in the next coming weeks, it is very, very possible you might be creating a massive, big double bottom
so, um, yeah, my take here would be, if you lose this level, what major levels are we looking for here on on cadena? let me just take a look at lev level to level
this is exactly, i'll take a look at the superchats right away, guys, just doing, i want to do a little bit of a good analysis, taking a look at strong levels on the exact close and open here is at the one dollar
we've got a one dollar level here on on daily level on cadena
we lose this level, it's going to be, i think we're going to have an aggressive drop on canada to one dollar
it is very, very possible, level to level, be prepared to potentially long the one dollar
if you do lose this, 139 on kadena, zooming back here to the four hourly, you're going to have a very good opportunities
if you do have a successful breakout, nice four hourly candle close good, solid breakout
it will be rejected at least once, in my opinion, before you do create a kind of a double bottom or something
but i mean, the possibilities in holding the range for the double bottom is also very, very possible
i mean, you got a pretty, pretty solid, lower, high resistance trend line that's been very, very well respected from the second touch
from that second touch here, you've been respected three times, four times, five times
so if you break above this, this this, above this range, you have a big gap on the vpvr from the volume traded the last two months here
the possibility and actually coming back, coming up to retest the two dollars is very, very possible
the drop you're looking at the four hourly charts starts here at 214, which was created on the 6th of june
so you got this height, you got this height, you've got one drop, you've got this drop
and then from this range is where the drop starts right? you could arguably discuss here or here, but, um, yeah, i would, i would go from this zone approximately, from this impulsive move then down
could we have a leg up here? um, to the 7 8 range? 618 probably won't hold
we got another one right here, which would be hitting the 618
from here to here, you might see some volatility, some good spikes
especially if you do get that breakout from the zone, you will have volatility, very likely to come around back down to retest this trend line
because a lot of people with, you know, a lot of people are like, yeah, we broke the trend line
absolutely not what most of the time happens? you come back down, retest the trend line, and then you potentially go back up
so that is, um, this is absolutely, uh, you know, for trapping the traders, you know, the retail traders
you are going to want to looking for that short, for that potential roll back down to the 618 or the retest of the trend line
well, depending on where you have that impulsive move to this zone, you are aiming to roll back down to the 618 at least
so shorting opportunity in between 188 and 25, in my personal opinion, for me, of course, not financial advice, but that would be the the perfect zone here
you're aiming for that six one eight level, also from this major drop, six one eight zone would be starting at the 188 levels, approximately from the highs of this drop, you are aiming for that 61865, which is at the 188 level, start of this box, the start of a spike on the vpvr
what i do know is that if we do go up and get a reaction at the 188, 190, 195, if we do get a reaction at this level, this is a level that i would short
matter of fact, i'm going to put an alarm here at this level, where at the 188? no, slightly below 185, so i can get the alarm and have time to see the reaction that we do have at that level
if you are interested in trading, you you have, you know, usdt perpetual here
if you haven't signed up for bibit and you're an experienced trader, you've got an insane bonus to claim, up to four thousand and fifty dollars
insane bonus on by bit of up to four thousand and fifty dollars that you can claim on the rewards hub
um, you need to follow the steps, of course, to to claim that bonus
you cannot deposit five dollars and expect to get four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus
uh, it's gonna be looking pretty bullish, you know, right? if you do break this resistance trend line, because, you know, the adam and eve double bottom scenario is also possible
but like i said, these are only day trades or small swing trades
this doesn't mean that you are going to continue aggressively to the downside
this is just a potential day trade, right from zone to zone, right? if i were to be shorting at 190, i would be taking profits here at the six, one, eight, uh, which was around about that one dollar 55 cents um
get zone to zone, okay? because you could be actually recovering again here, breaking some big, major resistance levels, holding our support, and continuing back up, okay, in the next coming weeks, all the way up here to this 340
with the current market bearish sentiment, it's going to take a long time for crypto investors to gain confidence again
we do have a pretty nice zone here, bang, bang, and a slow potential accumulation here
i mean, i got someone on on the telegram group saying, bitcoin hasn't dropped that much
five six days, we have dropped from, you know, almost thirty two thousand dollars down here to, um, twenty thousand
expect relief rallies, especially with this kind of price action
you know, this is a beautiful, beautiful pro type of price action for that kind of bigger relief rally before you potentially continues the downside, right? it just looks pretty, pretty nice, a descending wedge scenario, um
but like i said, if you're looking for day trades or scalps um, this is a big zone on on bitcoin, the the 22 300, this high over here that i mentioned at the beginning of the live stream, you know, hitting the high, you'll be breaking the resistance trend line
very likely to get rejected here and get a and then potentially continue back up, creating that higher low, and then for a bigger, bigger relief rate in the coming days
it's all going to depend, you know, we might not break this resistance and have a massive move to the downside, you know, sub 20 000
you know, if you are looking to catch the bottom, or to along the bottom, yeah, you're just going to get burnt
so, you know, looking at the trend, looking at the higher probability is the trend to the downside
let's go to the two hourly chart, and you have a pretty nice impulsive move here to the downside from this level, right? from this level, you have a pretty nice impulsive move
from this major drop, you're hitting a large, large here level on the vpvr
uh, i think you are very likely gonna get rejected from the zone
and it's also the six one eight from this drop here that we've got from this height
because what you did have here is a bounce from this range, and has dropped from this level
volume profile from the last, you know, a few days traded here
also, vpvr on the daily vpvr on the daily levels, uh? i mean, yeah, this is pretty, pretty cool
you have, do you do have it here? also, strongest level we have
we did find in the past some good trading opportunities with the, with the svp, looking at the strongest levels from each day
so if you do, you know, come back here, claim this four hourly level
good trading opportunity right there for a quick scalp day trade, maybe a small swing trade till you actually come down to retest the resistance trend line for a potential bounce again
okay, you could get a bounce from this, from this resistance trend line hitting their 618 level, depending on where you're going to go to finish the pump
when we're dumping, i'm looking for lungs, um level to level, always
of course, if we are in a downtrend, if we pump in a massive, big downtrend, i'm looking for shorts, no doubt, no doubt about that
um, can the price get rejected from this zone? this is the question
we could get rejected from this trend line, actually, from this lower high trend line, in the next coming hours? very, very possible to revisit the low area zone
well, um, i mean, a big relief rally can happen, no doubt about that
if we start breaking major resistance levels, that there will be holding, uh, nicely as support
you know, why do you think 27k? okay, we got, yeah, 618 would be that 272 from this major drop, right? so can we have a relief rally in the next coming weeks, all the way up here to, um, to 272
let's see what happens today with the font meeting, the meeting, the meeting
uh, confederate del font here in spanish at 8 30 central european time
we've got some, you know, decision that deposits eight o'clock is the interest rate decision
is it going to be 05? is it going to be 075? let me know, guys
what do you think in the comment section? what will the height be? will it be 05, or will it be 075? let me know
hey, andy, can you please check out lto network? uh, what's the good buying zone? let's take a look
in my personal opinion, it is, it does look like it is already in a good buying zone
i guess your question is, is, uh, for accumulation, right? not for trading
so a good buying zone for lto network is right over here at these levels
nice support here once we got above the six, seven cent level
if you take a look at the amount of volume there is, from 2019 to end of 2020, this was a major accumulation zone, massive, big market hype cycle
so, yeah, in between, in between um 35 cents and this level right now, which is the top of the value area, high from the volume traded in between 2019 and 2020, is already going to be a nice accumulation zone
especially if the next coming weeks and months here, we are going to go sideways and slightly to the downside
you know, if we start making the next price action like this, in the next coming months, i'm, i will say most to most of my community, i am accumulating this crypto
if we especially in the next coming months, i'm already dollar cost averaging into bitcoin and ethereum, every single week
you know, what if bitcoin doesn't reach twelve thousand dollars? what happens if it doesn't? you know, i think, you know, there is the possibility, is there? there is fear in the market
but what happens if we don't reach those levels? i think most of the people, a lot of people are already expecting 10k
okay? a lot of people are expecting ten thousand dollar bitcoin, twelve thousand dollar bitcoin
what if we don't reach those levels? what if we find support below twenty thousand dollars? around about eighteen thousand dollars, around about seventeen thousand dollars, and just wick below here and create a massive double bottom accumulation spring point
and in the next, you know, end of the year, coming months, we start pumping, okay, and consolidating at these levels
what if this happens? you know, a lot of people are going to miss out
a lot of people that want to buy bitcoin at 10, 12 k are gonna miss out
and it's just repeating, repeating itself, every single time, each cycle
so this is why, dollar cost averaging, or your longterm huddle position, these are already good levels in my opinion
okay, i'm telling you, a lot of people are expecting ten thousand dollars
i will not miss out, you know, just in case we do not dip below ten thousand dollars
it does make sense, because we have been talking about this in, uh, the last, last few weeks, talking about the vpvr, talking about the strongest level of support that bitcoin does have is at 12 000
it's where we do have major weekly and daily closes, right over here, from july of 2019, from august of 2020
when we are looking at the volume traded from 2017, 2018, 2019
you know, this is looking at four or five years of volume traded, the highest level is at twelve thousand dollars
so if we do come down to that range, it's very likely to be the bottom, or close to the bottom
twelve thousand dollar seems a realistic low level for bitcoin, or the lows in the next coming months
but what if we do not hold the range? what if we find support below twenty thousand dollars and start consolidating and creating slightly lower lows? sideways action? this is going to be a clear accumulation
if we start making this price action in the next coming months, i'm gonna say i'm all in
i am aiming to do a live stream at around about half seven, eight o'clock central european time
i mean, this is the thing, this does look like it wants to reverse
if we do break the zone, we're going to have some major, big levels here for for trading, potential short trade
if we do get a stop here in a small consolidation at the 22 200, twenty two thousand, twenty two thousand, three two hundred, you know, plus minus a couple of hundred dollars because of the volatility
major consolation here on the four hourly, big four hourly level
stay cautious for a potential big rejection at that range, and maybe a big pump here, creating a high low
i'm looking for this price action maybe in the next coming hours
i think we would be aiming for this high zone, big liquidity grab at this high zone, high of the of the descending wedge, which is at the 24 000 level, slightly below
even though it's i'm just about to leave the live stream right now
had a big, major consolidation, a big, major level that got bounced, uh, broke down
if we go to the four hourly chart, we're going to the lower time frames
um, huge descending triangle that we were talking about here for the last few weeks, massive, big, aggressive drop
we've got a bounce from a daily level, very, very short bounce, came back down
i would say, i would say this is ready for a bigger relief rally
if we do have a short term, if we do break above this range, i wouldn't trust a short here
but if we do break this zone and and have a little bit of big, big, big bullish price action
i'm not sure if we're going to get that high, but this, it might be a good level to place a long if we do get a big, massive pump and a bit of a drop here
not much to add with ethereum, i will be doing a full analysis on ethereum afterwards for the live stream
okay, i'll be getting some levels ready for ethereum, but we are focusing on bitcoin mostly
and bitcoin does look like it wants to have a larger relief rally, guys
we've got some bullish divergence here with these lower lows, a kind of a descending wedge pattern
high of the wedge can be reached, maybe in a couple of days or hours
if you want to trade other markets, such as silver, gold, natural gas oil, you know, as traditional stocks, such as dow jones, nasdaq, you can use bitcoin as collateral
okay? most of the times, if i can on, you know, natural gas or s p 500 and all of those, bitcoin are used to transfer to my long term huddle position for bitcoin
it's another way to support the channel, because i do get a small commission, but it is a platform that i use every single day, or almost every single day
if i do see the opportunities by bit primex bt, number one platforms for me that i use, you do get a good bonus down below if you use the links
smash up that like button on your way out, and i will see you in the next one
just one second, i'm just gonna give everyone the content on discord too
so we're just gonna go in and see exactly where we could potentially come to
i actually love when we see some news coming out, you see some action in the market
i am in long do you recommend me to victor? i cannot tell you what to do, but i'll show you what i see on the charts
first of all, guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that
we have 63 people on it's 16 people that liked it, so like it
and then we're just going straight into the charts, and i'll show you exactly what i see
oh, why does it clear on the highest and sorry, i'm like, um, going to the higher time frames
we do have the we already have the key levels, and we saw that we did retest, uh, 21 040 today
but we do have the news coming out, so i just want to make, make make sure that you understand, when the news comes out, usually the market is just going to the opposite direction
what we're going to do is that i will take a fibonacci from 23 020, uh, 22, 21 033, go down to the lower time frames
remember now, guys, that we are still obviously in a huge downtrend
the fender reserve has raised interest by sir, the highest increase since not all
a crypto market is reacting with high volatility? yes, exactly
but i just want you, you do whatever you want to do, but i just want you to be careful because it doesn't matter kind of what type of news we look at
if we are in a heavily downtrend, the market will not change direction just based of the news
the market when when we have the drop like this, the only thing that we see is a reverse
but you will never see news, uh, if it's not like worldwide, like when we had the corona, obviously, that just, you know, you saw this huge bounce, right? um, but this will not change the direction
so, i mean, i know a lot of people is happy when they see, when they see the market go up a little bit, but this is only, this is only new
um, we also had on, i was looking at nasa, i was looking at nasa, and we did have a, we do have a gap on nasa
so we are retesting the level right now on the 1561, at twenty two thousand and forty eight
we could definitely see the market pull back up to these levels once again, at 22 048 or 22 274, as i told you
how are ya? matt, is everything okay with you? we have alexander here
um, so, yeah, um, we can put an alert on this, is this the 50 yeah, we can put an alert on the 50 percent in case we see the market pull back up to that level
so i was in a trade when it came to to link, a chain link, but my stoploss got got hit, actually
um, i didn't have, i've never moved my stoploss to entry, so my stoploss got hit
we actually had a really great, um, trade this morning when it came to link
don't forget that you obviously, can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and this is the great thing when it comes to buy bit, is that we can hold up positions for a longer time with very low fees
if we break, if we would see more momentum, but i don't think that will happen
is how many, all of the new should we have been coming out already
so what usually happens is that the market will just correct itself after a big move like this
um, if we don't see the huge drop right now, we can expect the market to pull back up again to the fibonacci levels
as i said, if we have more momentum to the upside, i would look at 23 040, because that is also a key level, um that we can come back up and retest for another drop
i'm gonna take this fibonacci away so we can see more clear um, but we want to see if the market pulls back up to this level at thousand and forty, to see if we, we are retesting the fibonacci levels
guys, if you haven't, like, uh, like the live stream, please go inside and do that
and because you're helping me with the algorithm, so we can reach out to more people who will be super sweet
if you're new to the channel, my name is natalie, and i am here to share you my knowledge
um, i so many years i've been looking at the charts when when we've had news coming out
and if we, if if we are inside trades when news coming in, and we, we do have our entry around, um, pretty close to this move, usually you just get faked out
uh, looking at ethereum, though we tried to break 1130, and we are right now retesting the 50
so i dragged another fibonacci from 1252 back down to the low at 1093
so it's gonna be, can you see how perfectly the market came back up and retested this fibonacci level? it's amazing
but if we would say, bigger pullback, because we can definitely see that soon, we can drag another fibonacci from and we can drag it from 1530 back down to the low at 1090
and if we would see a bigger momentum to the upside, uh, we can come back up and retest, uh, 1 310, potentially 1360
and you can see that we have the um, the key level, 1330, in between the 15 and 61
so we can definitely expect the market to to give us a little bit of a push
this is the eight hourly candlestick, looking at the four hourly
we also, we can also use this previous support as a guideline
because if we close above the support, guys, we technically have right now
um, we did create a lower low, market created a higher low, which means now that we can start to see some movements to the upside and retest this level
so i definitely can see the market pull back up a little bit more, go down to the lower time frames
let's see, is any one of you inside the tree? have you been taking some traits today? it would be interesting for me
and if you did, what level did you buy or sell it from? are you in profit? are you in draw down? how how are you? are you in panic? does every does everything feel good? or even some good profits? how's it going? and guys, if you want to be part of bitcoin census community, i have a little community, uh? or not a little one
everyone is on their if on their different journey when it comes to trading
so if you want to connect with me and my community, you have the chat in the live chat right now
i also want to take, oops, i also want to take the higher time frames fibonacci to the lower time frames
and we can definitely only retest this level now and then see the market push back up
another thing that obviously also can happen is that if we take fibonacci from 1060 back up to 1182, we just might see a pullback down to potentially 1122 or 10107
can you see how the minus 12 is exactly combined with the with the key level? it is perfect, perfectly combined with that level
so what we're gonna do, i am not inside a trade right now, but if we would see the market pull back down to um 1120, trading view will give me an alert
if we obviously don't see the the huge push right now because we came back down and retested the preview support that we are inside right now
but i think also that this can be pretty far away for the market to to come back down and retest
okay, do you have any coins that you want me to look at? let's see if we do have any coins
was this yesterday? i don't remember exactly where these were
but going to the higher time frames, i already had a a fibonacci level today
but you know what i asked? oh, i actually want to drag it up to four dollars and 2860 on the daily chart
so the level that i look for solana to pull back up to is 3341 and 3488
going to the lower time frames, now we do have higher highs and higher lows
so as long as we are above this trend line, we just might see retest, and then see the continuation up to these levels
and then we just might, slowly, instead see the market reverse back down, because the market needs to pull back up
i mean, it doesn't have to, but that is usually what's happening
you see the market giving us the support, and then market needs to pull back up to create a lower high
and then you see the market giving you the next impulsive move with the other drop
now, market, if we follow market structure, we need to, i create another lower high
and you can also see that that is combined with the previous lower low that we did have
so you'll see lower high, lower low, lower low, and now lower high somewhere here below the support
right? um, if we break that level, if we would see solana break 3643, and we have more momentum to the upside, we can go back in time and we're looking at this previous resistance
this previous resistance just might turn into a new resistance and then pull back down
remember that on solana, we also came back down to a previous support
so from this candlestick that we did have, or also, this is on the weekly chart, at 19 of july, market came back down exactly
can you see how perfectly the market retested this? so we're just gonna highlight the body of this candle because i think it's very important
and we saw the market came back down perfectly and retested it, and also created a high low
so yeah, i would just wait for the market to to pull back up to these levels
we're also right now retesting this previous resistance that you can see that we are
um [Music], that we did close below, go to the lower time frames
if we see the market pull back down, we just might see the market pull back down to 2990 or 2960
and then you just might see the market pull back up, give another higher low at the previous resistance that turn into support, and then see the potential push to the higher time frames
so that's what i see on, that is what i see right now on solana
i'm just going to try to take one of the coins here so i don't look too forever
i don't think i've ever looked at this pair before, so i don't know, i mean, i'm super good when it comes to the technicals, but i don't know nothing about this project
but what we can use is this previous support at as 670 and 735
um [Music], can you see that? how good can you build i'm just joking or not
can you see how perfect this fibonacci was just exactly combined? okay, so we have obviously the the 15 61 that you can potentially see the market pull back up to
and then we want to see if this is a level where we slowly, instead to see the market reverse back down
hey, mike, how are you? um, so this is, this is what i see right now
if we see the market reverse back up, we we will break above 342, potential retest
and then that, for me, is a clear indication that if we retest this support from above, it will, it will take us back up to these levels, or potentially can do that at least
but, but always remember that, um, just because we see some movements to the upside, this doesn't mean the whole trend will reverse
it means that the market is giving us the the wreath, uh, the retest
came back down, retested this level at 30, 30 of december 2, 2020
okay? so either we see the market pullback up to nine to nine dollars again as a resistance, support turn into resistance, because you could see that the market was consolidating
another thing that we can do is that we drag fibonacci from 1050 back down to 780
so the the fibonacci levels is 878 and in nine point, nine point eighteen
go to the lower time frames now, because it's we were looking at the daily chart
wait a minute, like that needs to be perfectly very important
and, okay, it's pretty hard now, because the market is obviously, obviously just pushing up
the only thing that we can see now is we broke the resistance trend line
and we are right now trying to break the last lower high at 1750
if we see bigger push and then we see the market reverse back down, that's when we're trying to figure out if the higher low will be created
and then i can buy the market back up to eight point seven dot seventy seven dollars, or 920
that just might turn into a new lower high and resistance and then reverse back down
hope smoking joe is there somewhere, even if it doesn't say anything, but everyone loves smoking joe
i've been trading since 2018, or that was when i got introduced
if you're new to the channel, don't forget to go in inside and subscribe to it, because i have daily updates about cryptocurrencies every single day, monday to sunday
but during monday to for monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time, that is one hour before london session opens, i always have morning livestream setups
uh, morning live streams so we can see what happens during during the day
i'm no financial advisor, but i just show you my levels to see what the market can do against them during the day
if you also want to back test and practice um together with me, because this is how we become better, better at traders
i will also have them during the week, not today, because the market is very volatile
you can also receive a bonus on five bits, up to four thousand and fifty dollars, by using the link in the description down below the video
okay, so now we did went through solana not so long ago, so you can definitely, you can go back
i'm so i'm you don't understand how happy i am when i receive all of your beautiful comments
the third touch is usually when you see the market, is usually when you see the market, uh, reverse from that level and go
we can also drag a trend line right here that so we can connect the dots
so let's say now, if we would see the market having bigger pull back to the upside
we're first of all going to look at the low of this week, this previous support that we did break, and that is around 07 twenty three
and the the high of the box that i created was zero point seven thousand eight hundred and seventy four
so we know exactly who the person is, uh, who does this? please stop do this
like go and go and make time for something else, right? these these spammers that have no life, we know exactly who you are
so if we break above this resistance trend line right here, um, that is a clear indication that this could be the pullback up, as i told you, zero point seven thousand four hundred and twenty three
and zero point seven thousand nine hundred and thirty three can be a level we are retesting if we see the market having more momentum
from these levels, this is where i expect the market to reverse back down
if you speak swedish, i would also like to be able to speak it
but obviously, if we, if we don't see the break of that level, this could also happen
because this is pretty far away, a lot of things will happen before we even reach these levels, right? so what we're going to do is that we will also drag flip from 06 408 back down to the low at zero point four thousand six hundred and fifty one
and right now you can see the market potentially pull back up to zero point five thousand four hundred and ninety six and zero point five thousand seven hundred and sixteen
and that is also combined with the resistance trend line, with the resistance trend line that you can also come back up and retest
because remember, when it comes to trend lines, trend lines is 90 percent more respected than support, horizontal support and resistance trend lines
um not only how to receive the bonus, you have the link in the description down below, and it will tell you exactly how to do everything, step by step
and obviously, it depends on how much you are depositing of to receive the bonus
when the market is looking like this, i'm just waiting for the market to do whatever the market is supposed to do
and when the market has calmed down, i choose to go into the charts
but i am not that, i'm not that type of trader that trade the market during, uh, when the market is doing its move, and especially not when news comes out, because it's so volatile
um, so yeah, as i told you on on ethereum, we can pull back up to um 1 310 and 1 363
and this is where i will look for the market if we would see a possible reverse back down
i'm gonna put the alert so i can see, if we won't see the market being i'll come back to this level
and even if so, let's say now, if the market is not reaching the higher time frames, fibonacci levels that i spoke about
um, if we would see the market now, from nowhere, close below 1154, and see the market break inside the the resistance trend line, or just break, first of all, break below 1130
but usually the market, if you have one huge, big, volatile, bearish candlestick, you can potentially see recess from below, and then slowly and steady see the market continues back down
and when the market reaches these levels, or you just might see the market also, you know, do this
this is when i'm going to the charts, go to ethereum, again, so you can see that we do have the key levels right here
but as i told you, if we have the bigger pullback, we'll drag the fibonacci
if we drag a bigger pullback from um, 28 032 back down to 20 677, we have fibonacci levels 24 343 and twenty five thousand two hundred and seventy and that is combined with the 25 040 key level
how are ya? how you doing? i hope everyone is feeling great today guys
do we have any people from sweden here? or do we have anyone from norway or, uh, finland, or maybe, um, denmark, somewhere, you know, close to my country? uk, we have some people from the uk
oh, dobre, i'm just saying it's putting out words that i you know? the only words that i didn't that i know
and i always say, i know one word, and that is that, i don't know if that's if it sounds good, but that's what i know
if you, if you're not part of somalia, i have some friends from somalia too
if you want to be part of bitcoin census community, you will have the link to that chat
the only thing that i will require from you is that you will have a great attitude, great attitude, and just share your knowledge
i have so many songs from uh, you have so many great artists from there to the moon
you know, sometimes we just need to take our brain off the charts, and we just might continue now
he's been in the community for a while, and he's been getting so good at trading
so when it comes to the community, um, we do have two different communities
we have one with andy, and he's also a great youtuber for, uh, bitcoin census
but the community that i have, it's a cryptic bitcoin sense is natalie
so you are in more contact with me, uh, just so you it's so it you're not getting confused
it's just that we need to, you know, my followers with me and him
so this, uh, when it comes to, when it comes to dxi, y i y, whatever you want to say, how you say it, we need to have a pullback
and the last lower high was at 101208, and now the potential high is 105485
so we just might see the market pull back down to 103333 and 102 points 817
okay, so this is only giving me a great confirmation that we, if we pull back down to this level on the xy, on bitcoin, this and on the other coins, this is where we also start to see a bigger pullback to the upside
so it kind of makes sense for the market to pull back down here on the xi and the market to pull back to the upside, to around 25 040, if this is the case
but first of all, remember, we need to come back up and retest 23 040, because this is a key level double top, about to break neckline
this is the great thing when it comes to the channel, we have so many people in the community, and they develop and become better and better and better traders every single day
we have so many good people on the on the bitcoin census natalie community chat
and we have one guy, his name is smoking joe, and we have ronnie, and we obviously have raj too
and we have so many other people, but they are so good, and they're so happy to help you
so if you are in if you are a little bit confused to where you are on the charts, you can follow me, definitely, on my youtube channel
but the community is really great, because now you can connect with so many people from all over the world
so don't forget to be part of this beautiful community, because it can be so lonely to be a traitor, or just want to know how it works, right? so you are more than welcome
and i just want you to know that we did have someone coming into the community, uh, today or yesterday, and he said that he had 100 win rates
so i just want you to know that if someone tells you that they are 100 right all the time, they are completely lying to you
because a trader, even if he would be 100 right, that person will never contact you and tell you that he's 100 right
okay? don't listen to these people when it comes to trading, when it c when it comes to um trading
there's so many people that want to scam you because it's about money
me and everyone on bitcoin census will never reach out to you and tell you these things
so if you see the scammers, because they are everywhere, never give them money
and don't listen to anyone that says that they're 100 in win rate, because they are lying to you straight in your face
now what i did was that i took a fibonacci from 930 back down to 591
we see the market having a little bigger momentum now, to the upside, obviously
and it kind of looks like this could be the level where you actually see the market pull back up and retest
we combine it exactly with the last lower high, because this lower high was below the lower high at 7704, and the next lower high was 67
but the market never had the power to break the last lower high at lower low
and the resistance trend line is the one representing the downtrend
even if the mark, even if we had the news coming out, this is just pushing the pull back
but this does not mean that the market will reverse to the upside
you saw the market drop, drop, drop, consolidate, consolidate
now market needs to create a lower high that is in between the last lower high and the last lower low
and that is in the middle middle of the last lower high in the last lower low
and that is why fibonacci is the best and that gives us seven point sixty dollars and eight dollars for the market to potentially then reverse back down
but what we're going to do is that we will use the trend line, because trend lines are great
as i told you, trend lines are 90 more respected than horizontal support
so yeah, as long as we are above for now, this trend line supports trend line
and when you see that the market pulls back up to the fibonacci levels, what do we see? the market gives us then a head and shoulders
when you see the market reverse to the upside, what do we have? the market gives us a inverted head and shoulders mark
bullish reversal pattern, which means the market will pull back to the upside
okay, guys, if you want to be part of the bitcoin census community, natalie with me, you have the link in the description
and what else? what else? what else? what else? ltc, ltc, usdt, everything looks the same
okay, so we dragged the fibonacci right now from 6451 back down to 4347
so we are right now, we, uh, we are right now about to break the, uh, resistance
candlestick open right now, and everything depends, uh, because i cannot put a fibonacci unless we start to see the market pull back down, because that that will give us the next higher high
and, you know, we take the the fibonacci from the last higher low to the higher high, which gives us the levels where the next high low can be
so we're just gonna wait and see and let the market do whatever it's supposed to do
but these are the fibonacci levels that i speak about, um, that we can uh, retest
but this is because this is a fake out from the previous supports
so i to be honest, i really don't like how theta is looking, because the market is is really okay
but we saw the fake up from this, uh, support at one point, 154 again
so the resistance is definitely a level, uh, between 100, 1436 and 1523
and from this level, we will either see the market drop again, or we break it and then see, no
okay, so we're looking at, so i dragged the fibonacci from one point four hundred and sixty five instead, back down to the low at zero point to nine hundred and eighty two
we are right now retesting the fifty percent at one point two, two, two and one point two, 1280, 280
and what we're going to do is that we're going to highlight this resistance right here
so if we would now see that the market pulls back up to potentially of the 618 percent, and that is at one point 277
but if we would see the market then break below 1206, and you see rita's from below this fibonacci level will be valid, and that could take us back down to lower targets
but i still would want to see how the market is looking against this previous resistance that we did break
as i told you, if we break below this level and see retest, this would only be a fake up, but we retested the fibonacci levels, and that could take us back down even more
uh, if you haven't already subscribed to it, please go inside and do that

um, you also, you can also go into anger bitcoin senses, if you do not already follow him
he did have another live stream before me today, so if you haven't, uh, subscribed to his channel, you can also go inside and do that
um, the market is right? okay? you can see on theta the market is pulling back down
now, this is why i don't trade, this is why i don't trade the news, because you don't know how far the market will go
you see, go back to ethereum, okay, so same thing with ethereum, now, if we would see the market being very, um, let's see, i'm gonna take that one away too
if we see, as i told you before, that we have a bigger momentum to the downside
and we see retest from below around 11, 1153, that could take us back down, if we close below the resistance trend line that we also broke, that is definitely a sign that everything that you saw here was only fake out to the upside
and for the people who bought the market, they just got faked out
and then market continues to the right direction that we have
this is something that you need, oh, ronnie, of course, you tuned in
this is something that you definitely need to have in mind when the market gives us on this volatility
you will also see, we don't have red boxes tomorrow, but the market, we still have some news coming out, uh, during in the beginning of new york session
but when, the when, when you see, when you know, when you know that the market or we have the news, remember that the news usually goes against the train trend
so what the news does? it pull, you know, it just gives you a pullback
the market is only giving you the pullback, give you fake moves
and then you see the market continues to the right direction, which is to the downside
always, always, always, very important news will that it will not change the trend, not to change the trend
it will affect a little bit in the market, but would not reverse everything
but thank you so much guys for being on this live stream together with me

don't forget that you can also receive a bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in description down below on buy bait
i'm just gonna let the market do whatever it's supposed to do
[Music], just one second, i'm just gonna give everyone the content before i see you
so while you're coming in and waiting for me to see what you're talking about, you can go inside and like the live stream before i come to you guys, so you can help the algorithm and help me to reach out more people on youtube so we can grow the channel together
hello, how are you guys? ali, judith, uh side, hello, i'm good
um, we can start off by if you were, if you saw the video that i posted yesterday, uh, or was on my morning live stream
so, the trade that i'm still in my ethereum trade, my link tree took my stoploss
so yesterday we had this morning set up, um, and we spoke about the trade that i'm soon gonna talk about, that i'm in profit in right now
i also made another video where i showed you exactly why i took this trade, or these trades on ethereum
um, so i sold the market around, uh, at this level yesterday, or at these candlesticks
market came back down, retested my my level again, my entry, and now we're in profit
and we're looking at a pullback right now on the lower time frames, it might in my link trade got taken
um, it got taken by this fake out from the support that would they break
but one thing that i did, just for me to, um, see what actually happened, i took another fibonacci on the chain link now, from 828 back down to, uh, your lane trade was good
you should learn to be late like me when it comes to your stream
uh, gave us the fake out, right? uh, i took and i took the fibonacci back down to 540
and to be honest, no, this is actually a really good time for us to look at a position on link
so what we're gonna do right now is that we are gonna drag another fibonacci from 686 back down
but i want to see how it looks on the lower time frames though
so, uh, we'll start off with link, just because we look at it
david, why don't you use the fib from the candle wix, because that's not how i use fibonacci
uh? so i take it from 68 to six, back down to six point twenty one
so we can come back up and retest six point fifty four, because i definitely believe the market will go down, right um, so we can come back up and retest 654, potentially 662 also, and then see a drop
if you choose to go into this trade, it is your responsibility if this trade take your stop loss
it is your responsibility when we're going to the charts, when we take the trades, you always, always make your own decision to accept the fact that you can lose your money on your account
and one thing that i'm going to do is that i will take a in notification
you know what? i'm actually going to put a cell limit order on this one right away
so just give me a second, and i will go in and put a set limit order on um chain link right now
so the thing was, my stop loss got hit yesterday on chain link
but does that stop me to go into another trade when i see set up? of course not
because you should never involve your emotions when it comes to trading
i don't have to analyze the charts um more than what i did right now, because i um, because i've, i i already know the i already know this setup
we did this yesterday, and so i don't have to repeat it, because we don't have time for that
but we're retesting the low right now, but we just might have some momentum
so this is from, this is link usdt that i take on buy baked and stop plus will be six point, seven, three, zero, open short position
and i, i panicked when it got so close to my stoploss, so i closed ally
that is the worst thing that you can ever do, is take your outs
how are ya? i need, i'm gonna change the background music soon
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on by bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
yes, guys, if you have, if you don't know how to use um prime xpt or buy boots um
uh, you you have a link to a video that andy did before, so you can go and look at it, see how to use it
be very careful when it comes to it, because you you can gain a lot of money, you can also lose a lot of money
uh, nats, my wife says, good morning and wants to know how your hair is always so nice
so early in the morning, i take, no, i, you know enough, make sure to look at myself in the morning before before i sit in the in front of the computer
uh, why do you use the fit from canada to close and not top of the week? because that's not, you know, back testing
this is, this is the thing, guys, when you back test, you know what to do if you back test something and you see certain things looks better
in my case, it looks so much better when i have it from body to body
it's nothing wrong to, it's nothing wrong to, um, use it from week to week
can you see how close we were the stop loss? we were almost at stop loss
so how many peeps from it? we were five pips away from getting the stoploss hit
when i saw this happening, i was, i don't even think i was looking at it
um, so when we saw the market push back up yesterday, one smart thing that i did, because i think it's very interesting, while the market is, you know, going against you, what i do, and this is also why i am very good when it comes to trading, i'm not gonna lie
so what i what i did when i saw that the market pulled back up, instead of getting the panic, i started to analyze the charts even more
and i was just like, okay, you know what? i still trust my analyze
what type of level can we come back up right now and retest? so what i did, i used the key levels that i still had, that i that we did have since yesterday
and what i did was that i took the fibonacci from the from 1330 key level back down to key level 100 and 1000
i'm gonna take that one away, and i'm gonna take this one away, and i'll show you
can you see what the market did? we came back up and retested this fibonacci
and when i saw that, when i saw that, we we are closed inside of it
we saw the market push back down, and this candlestick close below
we tested the low, the previous support that we did have, also perfectly
can you see zooming beautifully? can you see how perfectly the market retested the support level that i did have? market went down
this was my confirmation when when you guys panicked, i understand that you panic when it's not your own trade
this is the thing, when you take, in this case, you take what i see, but when the market is going against us, i know, i understand that you get in panic because you actually do not know, you actually do not know what's going on, because you don't see what i see
so for myself, i was just starting to analyze the market even more, and i got comfortable with that
i was like, yeah, this is going, this is gonna happen, because i know what i saw
i know why i took this trade, right? so, um, i understand that
it's a, you feel a little bit, you know, lost when you take someone else's signal because you don't understand the the brain work behind it
and yeah, so i'm just gonna wait for the market to pull back down to that level
if uh soraya think this is a fun and noob show, then he, he should go to a place where professionals are
and not welcome to this channel any more than if you don't even want to be here
go back down to the lower time frames, because this is where we start to look at
oh, daniel, daniel, if you, if you see this, i'm gonna fix the the microphone
i had a really great guy yesterday that contacted me and said that he can help him with it
inferior, if your real traders don't reason to panic, say, profit one is possible, then taste of trading market will be like, lord papa
i think you're great, and i really appreciate you and the perspective
i just want to, i just want to help you guys and myself, of course
so today will be a little bit crazy when it comes to the to the charts
so, um, after new york session, around new york session, we will have some crazy news coming out today
i'm no financial advisor, but if you're not inside a, if you are not inside a trade, when the market starts to move, it's very easy to to get faked out
um, if you do not know, if you're not very professional, obviously, or actually know what you're doing
but if you are a beginner, remember that when news comes out, it can be really crazy
um, because, if you know, when we're looking at the chart like this
i wouldn't do anything at the moment, because if you would have sold the market, you should have sold it
um, we should have sold the market yesterday at, where was it? oh, yeah
but the thing is that i never sell the market at the lower low
i would never sell the market at this place, right? so one thing that can happen, we can drag another fib from 1218 back to 1102
and you can see that we do have a fibonacci, uh, slightly above the support that we did break
but based on that, um, yeah, we're just gonna, i'm just gonna wait and see if this can happen
uh, entry can be around 1160, 1174, and then a potential continuation of the drop
remember that i have my take profit at 930 also, because this is the next key level that i can see us come back down to
so that's what i see right now on ethereum, we can go to bitcoin
every single day since that day, i've been stuck at the charts
i know you guys are really good at what you're doing already, but it's always good to look at other people and just, you know, try to take as much as you can and practice that on the charts and combine it with your own strategy, or just if you need it, right? because that's how you develop
um, i do have a i do have a crypto trading for beginners playlist that you can go into
you can also see in the live chat like i've had these, uh, i mean, my followers are the best
and i just, i can just see how much everyone is developing and become so much, much, much, much better because they take their time to practice it
i just share my knowledge, but these people actually take their time with the charts
and that is, that is what we need to do, right? and you can also go and, uh, look at my previous videos
and this is back back testing is how, for example, if someone doesn't know what back testing is, if you want to become a good, a football player, basket player, or a singer, whatever you want to be good at, you have to practice that
you have to go in and practice it, just like everything else, right? so that's what i did on my back testing live streams, is that i just going practice the charts and tell you what i see
and this is what you have to do with yourself if you want to become a great trader
hit the notification, because these live streams, morning live streams
so if you want to become a good trader, you're definitely at at the right place
i'm, i try to be, or i'm always honest when it comes to trading, because trading is hard and, and, uh, i'm not here to tell you it's easy, because it's not
and if i say it's easy, i would just talk bad about myself, because i know how hard it is, because i've been doing every good trader, every trader, every real trader, knows how hard it is
so if someone comes in and tell you it's easy, or they're in profit 100, they are lying to you, because that is not the truth of trading
okay? um, so looking at bitcoin, then we can obviously see a huge drop
the same thing now we came back down now, and we tested the key level, 21 040
i gave you this one a couple of, uh, days ago, and you can see how perfectly the market is retesting these levels
so what have you been doing, neyman, on that yesterday? you sold ethereum, so fast
what did you see on the uh, what did you see on the chart so fast? saw the entry i i showed you, i showed you what i showed you
but i actually told you guys in this episode, i told you exactly why i took the shade
okay, so we could tr we could just try to do the same thing here, right? we can just try to take the fibonacci
i just want to see how it can be, right? so we take fibonacci from the key level 23 040 back down to the next key level at 20 140
so if we would see some bigger momentum today based on the news coming out, um, we just might
so usually, okay, so this is usually what happens when you have the news coming out we are in a downtrend
it can have the case can be that you see, first of all, the market pull back up really much like we can pull back up to 22 20, 22 040 and 22 284
we can see pull back to these levels and then see the market drop, or we cannot
but now we're looking at the 30 minutes chart, so this is a small, um, this is a small time frame, um, and if we see a bigger momentum, i will use 23 040 also to see if this is a level we could potentially retest, right? um, but if this fibonacci will be valid, you can see how perfectly we are retesting the 21, 21 040 lay uh level
um, i mean, we do have a pretty strong, heavily six hour candlestick that did close huge week
the market filled this week on the eight hourly, but yesterday it was lightning fat
i'm curious to know if there's a candle that printed you notice, or something
i just think, neymar know that i'm so used to look at the charts, it it just, i know what i look for, and it's so, it's hard, it's so hard to explain because you can just, usually when it comes i look at the candlestick so much, and you can see how i go in between time frames
so what i do when i look at the candlestick is just like, if i take one candlestick on the four hourly chart, for example, i just divide everything to lower time frames
and with the lower time frames, i can see how they created the bigger candlestick
and i can just see, because, you when you back test that so much, you just, you just get so used to how candlestick is, what certain type of candlesticks is doing
i'm not, i'm not sure how to explain this in a good way, but i, i just know, i can just see how how the candlestick is [Music]
but yeah, if we do have some bigger momentum today, we can come back up and we test 22 052, potentially thousand two hundred and ninety if you go down to the lower time frames
so we drag another fibonacci from twenty two thousand one hundred and twenty seven back down to the low that we're that we do have
um, so we can see market pull back up to these levels, if that is the case
and it's always good to have take profits, even if we see the market having a bigger momentum
but if this fibonacci will be valid, take profit one is twenty thousand eight hundred and sixty eight
take profit two is twenty thousand three hundred and seventeen
um, we can also come back down to 19 040, because that is the next key level that we see
if we go back to the higher time frames, just to see, okay, what is the key levels actually retesting? we can go to the monthly chart, and if we're looking at 21 140, you can see that this is also a level where the market did retest before
so we take it from the low, 3613 back to the high at um, eight hundred 550 eighty three
i this is something that i still want to use, because on the higher time frames we can break it, but then when we come back up again, we can retest the 50, 24, 730, and then see the market continues back up
we don't use these fibonacci levels at the moment, because they're not accurate
but when we start to see, or when i start to see the market pull back up again, because i do believe that will happen, um, i will use the the higher time frames fibonacci as a guideline, guideline for me
right now, i wouldn't do anything at the moment, because you can see the market created the lower high, market came back down, created the lower low, and we are still at the lower low, right? so we don't know exactly where the pullback can come to
and that's why it's really important for us to be patient about about this
so we do have right now two different fibonacci levels, right? so what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna give myself an alert in case we pull back up to twenty one thousand five hundred and forty three up
because remember, i never, i, i try to never sell the market at the lower low sometimes, you know, we all do mistakes, right? and then we just have to do it again
um, so i also look at twenty two thousand and forty five, but we have the lower fibonacci first of all
if we break, if we continue to see the market pull back up, then we would you look at? um, would you look at the other people higher timeframes? fibonacci for another job? when you spend hours studying any ask, you find patterns, and your brain muscle memory can start giving you what is called intuition, exactly, which is based on all your experiences and patterns that you've seen
do you recommend any book on candlesticks that helped you to get where you are as a trader? sorry about the question
obviously being very aware of candlesticks, um and patterns, absolutely
but the thing that i did wrong when i started to back test what was that i didn't understand where i was supposed to look at these, uh, patterns, right? because if you you you have patterns everywhere
when you look at the charts, you have patterns everywhere, right? you have engulfing, you have morning star, you have doji's
you have, we have to see what level, higher time frames support
it's very simple to explain that you have a very good understanding of price action and market structure
you have to start looking at your hands and look at your fingers, right? that's what you need to do
and if you don't do that, you cannot expect, you can't expect to have a, um, how do you say it? you can't expect anything if you don't practice it
if you're not very, very talented, obviously, because some people are
come back down to a strong previous, uh, support that we do have around 21, 22, around that level
put one one one in the chat if you want some freedom for the people who doesn't know or make fun of one one one
it's totally fine to make a fun of something that you don't understand
and if you use things like that, it can help you in this beautiful human experience that we have
it's a portal for you to open up, for to to other powers to help you manifest what you want in life
so what i did, um, i took a fibonacci now from 3407 back down to 2681
and we that that was a level where you saw the market pull back up yesterday
i just want to show you how it looks if we take it from the wake
i just like to take it from the body, because that's how i used to do it
everything depends on yourself, right? we did break the support trend line, just to see what happened? came back up exactly
but what i've learned is that when we have a quick retest, the market retested 50 more than the 618 percent on the higher time frames
fibonacci, the 61 per the 618 percent is always, always something that i use
fibonacci on the on on, when the market has already done the move, mark it goes, and quick retest it, it is the 50 that i use
yes, guys, if you haven't already like the live stream? please go inside and do that

and don't forget that, you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and the good thing when it comes to buy bit is the very low fees that we do have, that we do have, um, when we hold our position for a longer time
i mean, we can definitely drop back down today on ethereum and take my take profit at 930
looking at solana now, not so do you use 05 fib at low time frames, like 15, 30 minutes? charts? um, yeah, exactly
so you can, on lower time frames, like 15, 30 minutes, you can also use the 50 618 percent
but i definitely learned that the 50 is more respected on the lower time frames, and the 618 is very good to use on the higher time frames
because, as you can see, on the lower time frames, the distance between the fibonacci is not that much
so if i don't take the 618, if i take the 50 and the 618 percent gets hit, the distance from the 50 and 618 percent to the stoploss is not that big, right? but if we look at the higher time frames, fibonacci, say, for example
so on this fibonacci, the distance between the 61 and 61 and 50 is two pips
if you go back to the higher time frames, this the distance between the 15 61, it's 80 pips, exactly
so the distance is, you see, if you take the fifty percent as a t prime, as an entry, market comes back up and returns to sixty one point eight percent
depending on how on level leverage or not a lot size that you have, you are going to be in a very bad, and not bad draw down
but you see here, from the 618, with this huge week that we did have, a lot of people would be freaked out and be like, oh, my account's gonna blow up, right? but if you take it from the sixty one point eight percent, this is not gonna affect you this that much
not, you should not, you should post your lesson on spotify, because sometimes i'm looking at charts and just listen, oh, thank you crypto pizza for that
i've actually always wanted to open a kind of a podcast or spot uh, spotify, talking about, uh, trading
if you haven't already done it, i yes, we've done it, james, but thank you
but i would definitely look at, for example, we saw this wick right here
so what i do is that i look at this high and this high is, where is it? i would look at this candlestick right here
i would take it above that one, because i don't know why, i'm like, i don't know how to explain it, but i just look at the left and see where, where is the potential retest that we can have
and sometimes you don't know that you'll have such a big fake up from the from the 618 percent, right? um, oh, this is solana
what we spoke about was that we, we, we did break a previous report yesterday
and so we can pull back up to, okay, so we are below the 1130 uh key level
we can definitely see drop, drop from here, because we saw the market retested the key level
and if you drag fibonacci from um 1134 back down to 1102, we are now above the 618 percent, but we are technically at a lower low
and if we do have a bigger momentum today, based on the uh, based on the meeting, we can also drag um, no, we're gonna do it like this
um, maybe i said some other numbers before, but that is only because maybe i didn't take the exact same prices to the fibonacci
so either i would definitely wait for the market to pull back up and retest the previous support that would have or the fibonacci levels, that is slightly above, and then expect the market to drop if this fibonacci is valid
i haven't looked so much at the piers that you wanted me to look at
how are ya? matic oh, maybe you're not new, but it's actually the first time i see you comment on this live stream
go back up to higher time frames when it when we look at okay, so we did have some analyzers before
mark came back up, retested the previous high that we spoke about
[Music], we need clean charts when we're looking at the way we're looking at the charts
okay, so looking at matic, we are at the previous level, uh, that we saw the market spike up from before
um, [Music], next level to come back down to if we break that one, which it looks like we can do, if we break the level, uh, zero point three hundred and fifty, we can pull back down to zero point two hundred and thirty eight, or zero point two hundred dollars, go down to the lower time frames
we just might see a pullback to the upside a little bit, because we're right now, uh, retesting this previous support
so what we're going to do, if we only have a small pullback, we can come back up and retest 0400 or 0404
if we go to the 2 charts, if we have a bigger momentum, we can use these previous highs
and that could also take us back up to 0408 or zero point four hundred and fourteen
when the market pulls back up to these fibonacci levels, do we see one huge green candlestick just break through them? if that is the case, um, the market will these fibonacci levels will not be valid
um, but if this fibonacci is valid around 0404, take profit 1, 0375
and take profit three, zero point three hundred and forty three
i wanna do an update on chain link because i have a sell limit order on chain link right now
this is why we should never sell the market at the lower low guys
um, is that a kingdom hearts over there? is under background music? it is wrestle
it is, uh, i do have a settlement order right now on a chain link at six point five hundred and twenty four
just waiting for the market, obviously, to pull back up to it
so what we can do is just try to see where we can pull back up to um
we're waiting for the market to create the lower high and then see the market drop
i'm gonna end this live stream right now because i'm gonna go into twitter and tick tock and give uh, big consensus, the beautiful company, some content
if you don't follow bitcoin census on other social medias, we have tick tock, instagram
have you taking any profit on the ethereum, trade? no, not dan
and if someone makes fun of us just because we put one one one in the chat, just give back
always be humble when it comes to the charts, because if you're not humble towards the charts or other people, the market will take you down
okay, don't forget to, uh, if you want to be a part of the bitcoin census telegram community, you also have link in the chat to that one
okay, guys, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and, uh, fifty dollars
my name is josh, and today the federal reserve hiked interest rates by 75 basis points, which is three quarters of a percent
and so in just a moment, i'll be explaining what that means for bitcoin and ethereum and where we could be heading next
first of all, just starting off the video with the recent 75 basis point hike, which is basically the federal reserve increasing the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, or three quarters of a percent
and so this has now taken the federal funds rate, also known as the fed's interest rate, from 1 up to 175 percent
and as i discussed in my last video, this was one of the most expected outcomes from the fed meeting, because before last friday, the majority were expecting a 50 basis point hike, originally
and then we got the cpi data coming in on friday, last friday, which basically showed us that inflation actually got a lot worse during may, which is not what the fed and jerome power were originally expecting
and so due to the inflation numbers coming in a lot worse than expected last friday, that then created the expectation of a 75 basis point hike in this fed meeting, which is basically what we got
and so because of the fact that we got the outcome that the majority were expecting after friday, we actually did not see any significant downside price action in the overall market, talking about the stock market and the crypto markets, immediately after the fed meeting and after this news came out
and that's simply because if the majority in the market starts expecting something, they start pricing it in in advance
so considering the fact that the fed is basically hiking rates alongside what the majority are expecting, as the majority get those expectations from what the inflation numbers are, what cpi is coming in at, then really it's the cpi data, the inflation numbers, that are actually more important at the moment, because, especially as of recent months, the inflation numbers that are coming in have proved to be leading indicators for what the fed is about to do
because, of course, if the fed raises interest rates higher than expected, that is more bearish
and the main reason as to why the fed would raise rates higher than expected is if inflation comes in higher than expected, like it did on friday
so obviously, between friday and today, we saw a lot of bearish price action in that time period
but today, after we got this result, we did not see any more significant bearish price action immediately after this results, due to the fact that this has pretty much already been priced in
and not long after we got the recent 75 basis point hike, jerome powell held his usual press conference, and one of the things he said in that press conference was that either a 50 basis point or 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting
and so there's a very high chance that the majority in the markets have already priced in either a 50 basis point hike or another 75 basis point hike happening next month
because, of course, the next fed meeting is on the 27th of july
but once again, it is important to remember that between now and the next fed meeting, we do have more inflation data, more cpi data, coming out, which is actually happening on the 13th of july
and of course, that will be the inflation data for this month of june
and so when we get that information in about a month from now, that would likely tell us what direction the fed might be taking in their next fed meeting towards the end of july
whether it's a 50 basis point hike, or another 75 basis point hike, depending on inflation, or something even worse, if inflation gets a lot worse
and if that's the case, we would likely start seeing that getting priced into the markets on the 13th of next month, when we see that inflation number
stock market today, this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
we've seen a bit of a shortterm bounce because the market got what it expected, which reduces uncertainty, therefore reducing risk
and so it's actually quite possible that between now and when we see the next inflation numbers in around a month from now, we could actually see a bit of sideways price action
maybe even a bit of a relief rally in the stock markets, like what we saw in may and early june before we got that bad inflation data last friday
or like what we saw back in march, where we actually saw a decent shortterm rally after a fed meeting, before the next inflation data came out
and so overall, because we got the news that the majority were already expecting, this is actually fairly good news in the somewhat shorter term
and this light bounce in the stock market has also transferred over to the shortterm bitcoin price action
as you can see that in recent hours, especially following the fed meeting, we saw some shortterm bullish price action, which is also coming just after we saw a bullish divergence form on the fourhour bitcoin chart
but to keep in mind, this is all talking about the shorter term, because generally speaking, a fourhour bullish divergence usually lasts for a few days, and in most cases, it starts wearing off within about a week
but either way, the situation in the shorter term is looking better today than it was yesterday
because if you're looking at the monthly bitcoin charts right here, bitcoin was retesting the old 20k alltime high that we set back in 2017
and throughout bitcoin's entire price history, the bitcoin price has never dropped below one of its previous cycle alltime highs
so for example, the 2013 bull market top was just above one thousand dollars per bitcoin
and if you're looking at the bottom of the 2018 bear market, which was the next major bear market, the bitcoin price bottoms out at around three thousand dollars per bitcoin
so we did not go below the previous cycles bull market alltime high
and as of right now, at least at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price has currently not gone below that previous 2017 bull market top, which is good to see
and also, if you're looking at the monthly bitcoin rsi, we're at all time low levels in the monthly rsi, which means, on the monthly chart, bitcoin is currently more oversold than it has ever been before
and you can say something similar about the weekly bitcoin rsi being oversold as well
right now, we're more oversold than what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market
which means, technically speaking, based on the rsi indicator alone, right now, we're technically getting a better deal at the moment than what we got at the end of the 2018 bear market
and i know a lot of you might say, well, the bitcoin price is clearly a lot higher than 3 000 per bitcoin
but keep in mind back then in 2018, there was a lot less going for bitcoin
there was almost no institutions getting involved like microstrategy or tesla back then
we also had no countries adopting bitcoin as a currency back then as well
so there's a lot more going for bitcoin right now, which is why the relative cheap price for bitcoin, based on the rsi, is at a much higher value
because when you think about how much infrastructure has been built around bitcoin, like all of the exchanges, the etfs, all of that sort of stuff, then fundamentally speaking, bitcoin right now is a safer bet than what we saw back in 2018 for a long term investment
of course, that's not financial advice that's just simply going off bitcoins fundamentals
and of course, we can also look at other indicators like the 200 week moving average, which is the red line right here
and back in the 2018 bear market, we basically bottomed out right around that 200 week moving average
during the march 2020 crash, on the other hand, we did see a weekly kennel close around that 200week moving average, but we actually saw a week in the bitcoin price all the way down towards the 300week moving average
and in both of these previous bitcoin bottoms, of course, we saw the bitcoin price drop below the 1000 day moving average, which is the green line
and so far we've obviously dropped below the 1000 day moving average
we've also dropped slightly below the 200 week moving average, like what we saw in march 2020
but at least as of right now, we have not seen a week down towards the 300 week moving average, which is coming into play at around 17 000 per bitcoin
but obviously, the price of bitcoin is not guaranteed to go down to those much lower levels just because we saw that one time during march 2020
so yes, technically speaking, it is not impossible for the bitcoin price to go lower, like, for example, down towards that 300 week moving average, like march 2020
but right now, my personal bitcoin strategy, my longterm investing strategy, is to dollar cost average quite heavily into bitcoin at the moment, in these low 20 000 prices
and if you take a look at the bitcoin long positions on the bitfenix exchange right now, they are still smashing into new alltime highs, which means the whales on this exchange are continuing to add more and more money to their bitcoin long positions, which means they're doubling down on their bet for the bitcoin price to go back to the upside sometime soon
and if you're looking at the last time we saw a lot of bitcoin long positions on this particular exchange open up like this, that was basically leading up to the middle of last year
and of course, during the middle of last year, that's when we saw the bitcoin price bottom out
and now, getting into the ethereum part of this video, this right here is the weekly ethereum to your dollar chart
and as i've been saying over the past few days, we have a lot of support around this 382 percent of fibonacci level, which is coming into play in between 1000 and 11 k, more specifically at around one thousand and fifty to one thousand and sixty
and so far, at the time of recording this video, the price of ethereum has found a decent amount of support at that support level
and also, keep in mind, ethereum is currently more oversold on the weekly charts than we've ever seen before, according to the weekly ethereum rsi
and upon doing further research, one of the main reasons why we have been seeing a lot of bearish price action, especially for ethereum, in recent weeks, is due to the fact that we're seeing a lot of liquidations happening in d fire
and i won't go too deep into this in this video, because this is really a big story to cover, but i have been covering it bit by bit over on my twitter and this can also be somewhat related to what's happening with celsius
and by the way, there's really no new updates for celsius today, so if you want to know more about the celsius situation, check out my last video on the channel
but basically, there's quite a lot of debt built up in d5, and a big chunk of that debt is getting quite close to liquidation
this is just one loan right here that is holding around 212 000 ethereum, worth well over 218 million us
basically, if the price of ethereum drops below one thousand dollars, then this loan holding over 200 million dollars worth of ethereum starts getting liquidated, which basically means a bunch of that ethereum starts getting dumped onto the market
and especially in recent weeks, we've actually already been seeing that happening in d5 with some slightly smaller loans getting liquidated
and so basically this big liquidation cascade is driving a lot of the selling pressure at the moment, especially for ethereum, but really driving a lot of the crypto market to the downside
and so let's just hope ethereum does not go below one thousand dollars, because that would be very bad for this loan
and by the way, if you want to get extra important information like this in real time, like celsius updates in real time, for example, make sure to follow me over on my twitter
and the link to my twitter is in the description down below, and also in the pinned comments
and just taking a look at the shortterm ethereum price action, it's basically the same story as the shortterm bitcoin price action
and in the hours immediately following the interest rate hike, we've actually seen some slight bullish price action because that's a bit of uncertainty reduced from the market once again
and so when you're talking about the shorter term, as in the next few days, the same as what i said for bitcoin on the 4hour chart can also be applied for the ethereum 4hour chart as well
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum short positions
right now, they're trading very close to alltime low levels, but we have seen a slight wick to the downside, which means we've seen a small amount of short positions open back up
but relatively speaking, the shorts on ethereum over on biff next, are actually very, very low, according to the history of these short positions over on bfnx, which means the whales on that particular exchange think the room to the downside is somewhat limited
while there's major risk for more upside price action in ethereum, because, of course, if you're in a short position, the risk is upside price action
and now giving you a quick update on the ethereum versus bitcoin charts here
on the weekly time frame right now, we're actually seeing a bit of a shortterm bounce from this trend line right here, coming into play at around 0048 bitcoin per ethereum
but overall, if you're looking at the bigger picture here, ethereum versus bitcoin is still at some very elevated levels
and so i'll be watching this trendline very closely, because if we break below that line of support that i just mentioned, then we could see a lot more downside price action for ethereum versus bitcoin, which basically means ethereum could continue underperforming against bitcoin
and one of the fundamental reasons as to why i am more bearish for ethereum versus bitcoin or the larger time frames here, despite the trend itself being a bearish trend is due to the fact that a lot of ethereum's value comes from people using ethereum, and especially applications built on top of ethereum, like alt coins and nfts
it's back in ethereum's first major bull market, which was the 2016 bull market, ethereum performed incredibly well in our bull markets
there was massive demand for ethereum in the bull market due to the fact that a lot of old queens were launching on ethereum
and of course, during the bull market, a lot of the old coins went crazy
and the majority of alt coins, like i said, were built on ethereum, which means you need ethereum to pay gas transactions and all of that sort of stuff
but then after the 2017 bull market, as we entered into the 2018 bear market, we saw a lot of that altcoin hype died down, which actually reduced the demand for ethereum
and i was personally in the market back then, back in 2017 2018, when all of that was happening
instead of the massive amounts of coins launching on ethereum, like what we saw back in 2017, that was driving up ethereum in the bull market, this time around we saw a massive amount of nfts really launching and booming on ethereum in this bull markets
but if you've been paying attention in recent months, obviously nfts have really started to cool down
and so due to that, there's simply less activity at the moment on ethereum, less demand for ethereum, which is one of the fundamental reasons as to why i am bearish on ethereum versus bitcoin, at the moment at least
but of course, ethereum, in my opinion, is a longterm investment
even though as of right now, at this stage in the markets, i am bearish on ethereum
super long term, talking about five to 10 years from now, i'm extremely bullish on ethereum
but anyway, if you found this video useful, definitely check out this video popping up right here on your screen, which can help you make money in crypto even when prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
all right, so bitcoin, the last six hours is here by the time i upload this video
this is going to mark the six hour countdown until the next federal reserve meeting
now, in today's video, i want to go through three of my macro btc charts
and i'm going to be going in order from the most conservative price tag to the most bearish price target
i'm going to be offering you three different perspectives, talking about what i think is most likely to pan out
and also, if you're if you want to know more about what to expect coming into this fomc meeting, and why i personally believe we're about to witness a 75 basis point increase, what that will mean for the market
what does this even mean in itself? then be sure to head over to my channel and watch yesterday's video, what to expect from tomorrow's fomc meeting
and once again, i'm going to be starting off with the most conservative target, and we'll be moving down to the most bearish target as we go so starting off with the cme gaps over on the chicago mercantile exchange futures
now these these futures tradings, they are obviously not open over on the weekend
so when bitcoin moves up or moves down over the weekend, you often have these price gaps
now the theory with the price gap fury is that often we move back into these price gaps and fill them before we start moving back to the upside
again, i don't want to lengthen out this video and go through like 10, 20 different examples
if you want to just be sure to type in btc1 or btc cme futures over on tradingview, and you can go check out the price gaps, like over here, over here, over here, over here, etcetera
but that being said, the next cme gap to the downside is at 18 500
now we've already massively cascaded below the previous cme gap round about the 22nd of december, and we're now currently heading down to the cme gap approximately within the ranges of the 11th to the 14th of december
and notice how my first target isn't the previous alltime high
now, in my opinion, i do not, unfortunately, think we're gonna be holding the previous alltime high
um, if you kind of keep up with what's going on in the economy, you'll know why the economy is in absolute shambles compared to how it was in previous cycles
i was here in 2018, and the, you know, the stir of geopolitical news war, uh, you know, real, real interest rates going up, real wages going down, the cost of living going up
and because of this reason, i think the most conservative target we should be looking for is another 96 drop over on the bitcoin price
so with that being said, let's move over into our next price prediction
now, i'm going to be moving over to, uh, one of my favorite macro charts
and if you're a veteran to my channel, if you've been watching for the past couple of months, uh, you'll recognize this because we were covering this quite a while ago
if i bring back my original price target, you can see we were calling for this move down to the 200 week
since we were all the way up here at 43 000, we were calling for a 46 drop
and at that time, yes, we did say this could be a potential bottom for bitcoin
but when we said that, obviously the uh consumer price index had not come out the, you know, the stir of the economy has gotten a lot worse since then
and now i believe that we should expect a 75 basis point increase instead of a 50 basis point increase
just quickly, the last 50 basis point increase on the last fomc meeting pulled us down more than 48
so you can imagine, if we have a 75 basis point increase, this could get very, very ugly
am i saying we're going to go down another 48? absolutely not
however, the next target to keep your eyes on is the next macro moving average
this is this orange line in the sand, the purple line in here
and actually, i should have it with a slight upwards inflection, because this is going to be taking in data points from the past 300 weeks
and you can imagine, just very quickly, if we drag this back, you know, 300 bars worth of data, then, you know, we're taking in data points from a very, very long period of time ago
so that being said, if we remove these, and we've got these extrapolated over
but what you'll notice is, if we talk about the 200 and the 300 week collectively, the 200 week was the exact bottom of the 215 bottom
and at this moment in time, the second the 300 week starts to load in, that represents that the btc usd price, specifically on this chart over on bitstamp, has been trading for 300 weeks
so we obviously do not have data of how the 300 week would have reacted, but in my opinion, it would have looked something like this
and as you can imagine, the 300 week would have been the bottom
bear market low was exactly on the um 200 week moving average
and when we capitulated in the pandemic scare, which, in my opinion, this drop and the pandemic scare, probably represents the most kind of likelihood of what we should expect in these markets
for example, if you look at this massive, massive capitulation, you can see on the weekly time frame, it was a huge, huge candle body to the downside, a huge wick down to the moving average, and then a big push up, and that was the bottom
now, in my opinion, we could really see something like this this week, where we just completely, completely cascade, and we head all the way down, uh, to the 300 week moving average
now, if something like this does happen, i would be heavily, heavily dca in bitcoin
now, uh, i want you to distinguish between dca and bitcoin, and dca and all coins
i've been very, very i've been advising you not to dca upgrades for the past couple of months
and, you know, if you've recently found my channel and you have been dca, then you know, obviously it's dcing just does not work in a bear market
i dca cranes back in 2018, round about this cycle, and i got absolutely wrecked
you know, they had a dead cat bounce, and when bitcoin came down and made a higher low, old cranes got slaughtered
the second most conservative target we have is down here to the 300 week
now i do believe if we do head down to this target, let's round it up approximately to 16 500, i do believe that we would be out of there relatively quickly
however, you do want to be very, very cautious, because, like i said, the state of the economy at this moment in time is a lot more brutal than we've previously seen in other cycles
however, you know, the fear uncertainty and out in this market, this moment, in this market, in this moment in time, and even the market structure looks very, very similar to what we saw in the pandemic scare
so with that being said, the second most conservative target is coming in at 16 500
now you can see, you know, i'm not going to draw the individual waves from the previous cycles, but you can see our first cycle, one, three wave, five wave, abc correction
and if we look at the market structure now, one impulse, free impulse, and we've already had the five impulse
so, you know, it's very, it's very, very obvious that we have already topped out in the market structure
if we come over to our abc correction, you can see our a, bearish impulse, b, correctory wave and c, bearish impulse
so with this being said, according to the elite wave theory, we would be in the last leg in the sand
and with these impulses within your a and you'll see bearish impulse
on the corrections, these constitute five waves to the downside
so depending on the direction of the trend, you have a five wave
so for example, if you're heading up in a bullish impulse, you'll have a one wave, three wave, five wave
and then an abc correction if you're switching into, uh, if you're switching into a correction, that isn't the five wave
so we've already had our one, impulse, three and pulse five, impulse a, b, c
and coming into our c wave, we've already had the one impulse, two, correctory wave, free bearish impulse
we are currently sitting within this last capitulation, at least according to elite wave theory
and like i said, you know, i would not be surprised if this does allow us to carry enough momentum to push back down, uh, below the previous alltime high, which is, at this range, around twenty thousand to nineteen thousand five hundred
but that being said, according to elliott wave theory, when you do have your a, b, c macro correction, the c wave should always be above the one wave, and it should always be below the free wave
so with that being said, the most bearish price target that i would consider coming into fruition is all the way down here, on the one wave of this bullish market structure
2018, you've got your one, wave two, correction wave three, impulse wave four, correctory wave five, bullish impulse wave
and if this c wave does uh be as bearish as physically possible, then the price tag would be down here at 14 000
so with all of that said, we now have three price targets over on the crypto, uh, over on the bitcoin price
so the most conservative, once again, coming in at 18 500, the second most conservative, coming in at 16 500, and the most bearish, coming in at 14 000
now, where is the exact bottom? well, the whole point of this exercise was to say we obviously do not know where the exact bottom is
you know, if you're watching a youtuber that says, i know where the exact bottom is, they're just lying to you, because no one knows where the bottom is
we're extrapolating based on, you know, elliott wave theory, the chicago mercantile exchange gap theory, and also the most commonly held moving averages, which are the 200 and the 300, the 300 being down here around about 165 000
so in my opinion, what is the best way to navigate these bitcoin markets at this moment in time? well, i've been saying that i am going to be buying the dip down on bitcoin at these lower price targets
now this makes me feel young again, because i've been in bitcoin for a while, and coming back down to these 20, uh, 20 000 price targets, i mean, it just reminds me of all the way back here in november 2020
and i was very, very happy to buy bitcoin down here, just like i was happy to buy bitcoin at 7 000, just like i was happy to buy bitcoin at 3 000, and just like i was buying bitcoin at 700
so i'm very, very happy to pick up cheap, cheap satoshi's round about these levels
with that being said, uh, i would have my buy orders going down in increments of size
so for example, i do now have buy orders set with a large amount of my capital on the cme gap at eighteen thousand five hundred
now, in my opinion, i actually personally don't think this is gonna hold
and i find it much more likely that we're going to head all the way down to the 300 week moving average
this is based on my ta this is based on looking at previous trends
and i find it most likely that sixteen thousand five hundred will be the bottom
but i do not wanna miss out on the opportunity of coming down to the one impulse on the elliott wave theory and ha, and missing out on bitcoin at fourteen thousand
i do not think that at this moment in time, this would be the time to be leveraging to the downside
once again, by time i post this video, this is going to mark the six hour countdown of the fomc meeting
so within six hours after i post this, the fomc is going to be wrapped up
i am, unfortunately, going to be busy towards the last half of this evening
so i will not be able to update all the old cranes and update everything that is going on in the market structure
but like i said, i made a video yesterday what to expect from the fomc meeting
and in my opinion at this moment in time, if we do have a 75 basis point increase, then we are very, very likely to massively head to the downside
if you do want to keep up on the minute like that of what the fomc results are, then be sure to head over to my twitter
you can also look in the comment or in the description of this video, you will find my socials
or alternatively, if you do head over to my twitter and click on about, you will find that we that we have the twitter, instagram and discord link
now also, if you're not part of the discord already, i do definitely recommend you join the discord
so like i said, if you want to join the discord, be sure to head over to here
if anyone comments anything about whatsapp or telegram, is a scam
i've been having a lot of scammers trying to impersonate my channel recently
i mean, think about it, logically, you know, i've got six thousand followers
why on earth would i want to give six thousand people my mobile phone number? so be very, very cautious
these scat these scammers are scumbags, and they will stop at nothing to steal your crypto
so what i've got for you today, hope you enjoyed today's video
if you want to take a screenshot of these price targets, be sure to do so
so bitcoin seems to be holding the 200 moving average on the weekly chart that we covered yesterday
there's something interesting that came across my path, which i actually didn't expect to find, but we'll cover that in a bit
so we've entered nicely into this yellow box territory, as previously mentioned, which is pretty much anything within this zone over here, underneath the 200 ema
was a good area to be a longterm investor, accumulating, i said, especially between these zones over here, which is the, uh, 200 purple ma and the 255 ma on the weekly chart
if price manages to come down to 19 hundred dollars, then we will tag that 255 ma
i still think it's within the realm of possibilities, and i'll show you exactly why
so yesterday i made a post on my twitter and i said, one interesting thing that i'm noticing is that some altcoins are holding up better than bitcoin
does anybody know what to make of that or why that is? now, of course, i know that the bitcoin dominance came down, which is why, obviously, uh, the altcoin started to push up
but the what? what was the reason that, uh, the altcoins were not getting as hits, as hard as what bitcoin was while everybody anticipated that bitcoin is capitulating? so vinnie lingam, uh, who i love and respect, responded, he said that, number one, the market doesn't expect a drop below 20k for btc
and number two, some altcoin treasuries are actually greater than their market caps of the coins trading
so that means that they could technic prop up those prices until the next bull run, if need be
uh, if, if that is the case, that they're artificially holding up the price, or buying it up using their treasuries, but i don't know, i don't know
he said here that altcoins are showing another corrective move
so wave five of wave five is missing, the one that forms all the divergences
and the main targets are 40 lower, but they should be reached quickly
i think that bitcoin might have a small push down, maybe just under 20k, 19k in that region
but when it comes to altcoins, i think that they haven't capitulated yet
i'll go on to the alt queen candles in a little bit, but i put this in the daily newsletter today, so make sure that you subscribe to that if you want the indepth explanation
but essentially, i have the total crypto market cap on a fiveday chart with the rsi put on
i've outlined the key liquidity zones, key levels and the trend line over here
and what you'll notice is that, uh, the total market cap is, by the way, everything that's bitcoin plus the altcoins
for those of you are new here, you can see that, uh, it came straight down into that liquidity zone
it hit, literally to the t at 861 billion dollars, and it's kind of pushing up off there
and as soon as this key resistance was lost, price, or at least the market cap, started to shoot down
one is, i am going to be on a lower high watch when this does come out of here, weather comes out now or later, if there's going to be any sort of a push into this area here, into the key horizontal, and then possibly another push down further
but one thing that i found interesting, and i was not expecting, this is the um when you look at the rsi
now, i marked it out on these verticals over here, so i marked the last time that the rsi actually came this low
and fair enough, on the 11th of january 2015, it marked the exact bottom
as well as on the 12th of december 2018, it also marked the exact bottom
so we haven't been this low pretty much, uh, we've only been this low twice historically
just because the rsi has reached these levels does not mean that it's suddenly just going to shoot out of here and that the bottom is in
as long as the rsi is trending down, it can continue all the way down to pretty much zero
so we this is still a bearish sign until such time as you see the rsi start to spike up and that moving average starts to curve back up, uh
and i would say that the main liquidity zone, where the ultimate support lies, is actually going to be in this zone over here, which matches up with bitcoin coming down to about 14k, which is going to bring your um total market cap to about 450 billion
now, when you look at total 2, it's almost exactly the same picture
we just don't have as much history on the old coin, so i only have one vertical, uh, representation to compare to
and i can zoom into that just to give you a little bit of perspective over there
now, the difference over here is, you'll notice that we haven't come and tagged this trendline over here
and this is what tells me that there is a possibility that all coins could still capitulate and have one more leg down
but if we had to have a quick flash crash of 28, that will be in line exactly of what al kapoor is mentioning
and from from my side, personally, i'm targeting more on the major altcoins, things like salon and things like ethereum
or possibly another 20 to 30 percent down, which would tag that trend line
now, with that being said, if you are a longterm investor and you're looking to dollar cost average in historically speaking, this is going to be a good zone
i mean, the last time i believed that we were at these prices was in december of 2020, which is a long time ago
okay, in other markets, over here, we have the dexi i mentioned on yesterday's show that if we managed to cross even one tick above that, it's bullish continuation for the dixie
if the weekly closes, of baby, especially if it closes as a full body candle like the previous week, that's going to be extremely bullish
and then i would say that it's probably not over yet for bitcoin, and there could potentially be more downside
new week open, big gap down, straight down, and we have a red market
of course, it's going to be heavily influenced by the fomc meeting, which is coming up tomorrow
and then we have jerome powell's usual, uh, conference afterwards
and then we need to see his tonality and how he speaks at that meeting
now, zooming in and looking at bitcoin, uh, if we have a look at it just purely from a charting perspective
now, the way that these capitulation candles typically happen is more similar to this over here
but you want to see a big wick that's left behind and priced to very quickly rally out of there
i don't think that this is going to turn out into a fullon capitulation
it's seeming to me more likely that we're going through a slow bleed
so i would be heavily buying with any sort of wicks into that area
i also had a look at the volume, and if i zoom out over here, let's just try and make that
okay, i can't make it much bigger, but if you want to look in relation to the previous volumes that we've had, this is definitely on the lower side
i mean, if i zoom in like this, you can see the wick that was left over here on the 12th of may, that 12th of may candle that even produced more volume than what we currently have
so for capitulation candle, you want to see a massive volume spike and a big, big selloff, and then you want price to be very quickly brought back up after that
and when you look at certain altcoins, so let's go on to solana for example
again, this is not what you would expect from altcoins to bottom
but i would expect it to come in a little bit deeper than that
if it gets, if it's if price starts to move and change, it will take it day by day
but at the moment, i'd only really feel safe going into bitcoin for the long term
and if i look at this chart over here, on the four hour you can see that all the emas are coming down
they're not as aggressively down yet as what they can get so there may still be a little bit more pain
possibly we could even just retest, sweep back down around these lows, then you have an opportunity to scoop some up
but when it comes to bottoms, guys, or at least buying bottoms, then you usually don't have too many chances
in a capitulation type of environment, it happens very, very quickly
it's a rapid selloff, and you only have a couple of hours to get in, and then price will vshape out of that
the macroeconomic situation of the world right now is not what it used to be
you have to bear in mind, if i go on to this chart over here, that quantitative easing, which is the exact opposite, started over here
so if we take our, let's just take our drawing tool, we started over here in march, look at what quantitative easing did
it did that entire move from from that area all the way up, like straight vertical
so i really do think that this time is a little bit different
they said, every everyone says every cycle, this time is different
but i really think this time is a little bit different, and you should really respect your money
uh, as chad says, respect your money, or it will find a new owner

[Music], so [Music], what's up, my crypto legends? how is everyone doing today? hope you're having a fantastic tuesday
let's analyze the situation here for bitcoin, see what's going on
are we gonna go much lower, or are we going to potentially reverse from these levels? we're gonna analyze the situation with this live stream and also go through the comment section, of course, to say hello to my fellow followers
how are you doing? i will be going through the comment section right away
i'm gonna go through the comment section right now say, hello
any signals we could be going lower, yes, but also some signals that we could be actually having a potential reversal
i'm going to explain the short position that i did get in and why i did get out, of course, at this low, i took 50 profit protected in my position, got stopped out that break even
you know, the price action looks a little bit exhausted here, and we could see a little bit of relief rally
now, i don't want to get the rsi out, but, yeah, i bet there are going to be some bullish divergence or something like that with these lower lows
we do not need that crappy indicator to know that, you know, a potential reversal is possible
there is a spike here with pretty large volume okay? this volume right over here is pretty large
you know, the possibility and actually having a larger relief rally, maybe to continue down, is very possible
so just to stay super, super cautious, i explained here in the telegram group, in the community group, that i did, actually did take a short here at the twenty two thousand seven hundred dollar range, and i took profits right over here
reason why is because we were hitting that six one eight level, okay, that six one eight level, from this major pump, this low over here, to the highs
and shorted this range because we could see the price exhaustion right there, entered into the trade locked
fifty percent of profits got stopped out to the other fifty percent
now, you can see here, you know it, this is, this is a no trade zone in my opinion, because, you know, it does look like, you know, there is a possibility, there is a possibility that you might, you know, you might actually want to create a kind of an inverse head and shoulder
and now this, you don't become a moon boy, because this is going to happen
when i started this, there is one of my fellow followers from a long time ago
can we please check shiba inu, because he's interested in buying for long term? absolutely
uh, rodol fayandi, thanks for keeping us updated and for the tips as to what to rack up during the bear market
uh, i will be here every single day for many, many years, i think
also, mickey jovick, hello, and, uh, king andy, hello, my man
so for the moment, i've got joseph, one of my strongest moderators
today's video, we were talking about, you know, the price actually rolling down from this range as soon as we started to make this kind of price action, bouncing from the 618, from this pump
okay? i was, you know, you can consider that there is some pretty large volume in this pump
sorry, you know, on the fiveminute chart, you know, one of the largest volumes from the last couple of days is right over here, from this major pump
so there is intentions here, you know, of the bulls, you know, actually buying this, this range
it is not the best level, in my opinion, for some potential day trades
now, this doesn't mean i know, we were talking about, you know, potentially hitting the lows and actually coming lower
but there is, there is a little bit of bearish exhaustion creating this slightly higher low, guys
we cannot ignore this price action, especially with this kind of pump, okay, with the volume that we've had in the lower time frames
this is possible that we're just going to create a lower high, okay, and roll down
you know, this is not a a perfect trading range, in my opinion
could you short this range and put your stop loss above this wick for potentially, you know, um, you know, aiming for these lows, you could
there is a possibility that we are going to retest the low 20 000 range, stop loss there
uh, i'm just, i'm just saying, people that are shorting stay um, cautious because of this kind of momentum that bitcoin is having
so anyway, i closed, uh, my trade in profits that i did short from this level over here, from the actual rejection from this daily level mentioned on this video, in today's video update
okay, this is major, strong daily level, very likely to get rejected and continue slightly to the downside
what happens? one of my favorite levels is the six one eight, of course, from this pump here, from this pump over here
you know, where did we hit perfectly and got that bounce? it is exactly yes, the six one eight
so, um, also, what what about here? from this low to from this high to this low over here, where are we getting rejected? yes, you are right
we are getting rejected from the six one eight, right from this dump
look at this daily, you know, look at these, um, one hourly candle, sorry, not dailies
soon as we get a spike here to the upside, this is probably going to get a bounce
you know, there are some you know, there is money to be made here
no financial advice, of course, but it's a major, major level
it's a very, very interesting level for me here on bitcoin, right this major range
if you want to do something like scalp day trades, all right, just a few hour trades, you know, this is a major, major zone
if we do, all right, the bulls here are probably want to get the volume ready and have a big spike if we break this zone, it's going to be a little bit of a nice pump
uh, it's very, very likely gonna have a pretty, pretty large spike in volume if it does break
now, if it does break, you know, you are looking at a first potential bounce, first potential consolidation with a, maybe a couple of one hourly candles, you know, getting that kind of consolidation at this range, for that price action to come back up to retest the highs, or slightly create a lower high on the six, on the six one eight
you wanna ride this zone to this level, to the six one eight levels, almost retesting the highs, something very similar to what has happened here, right? you are waiting for that consolidation
i decided to actually short this, talked on the telegram group while we were actually at those round about those levels
and also, you know, saying to my community that, you know, i'm taking 50 profits here at the 21 800, because we are hitting the 618
one of the main reasons, okay, i mean, it's fibonacci level, one of the main reasons you're hitting that 618 at this range, at the 21 700, 21 800, it's a good take profit zone if you're shorting this level also, because on the lower time frames, you can go to the 30 minute, 15 minute, you know, you this spike in volume was pretty interesting
all right? you do actually have a higher volume here on the coinbase chart, i think, or on different exchanges, you do have a a bit of a higher volume from this, a big, major candle
so it's just something to be aware so, like i said, you know, this is up to you, if you are happy and and and maybe risking this level, this short position, you know, a stop loss here above this wick, because you could get a little bit of more volatility, and then continue to the downside, creating this kind of lower high and coming down to retest the low 20 000, late levels
like i said, you know, the ideal scenario for me, um is, i mean, there's two options
you're either short from this level, you know, expecting that we are going to revisit the this lower 20 000 range, below 21 000, you know, stop loss
or either we kind of break out from this zone, and you are looking for rejections from these major levels, also, very likely this daily level
uh, maybe claiming this kind of high level over here, big consolidation, you maybe claim this daily level and then get rejected
but there is also a nice potential bounce if we do break with high volume to the upside at this 22 700 range
this is where we do have that daily level, uh, where we are getting rejected again, right now, at this moment
so there is some some potential gains to make on that movement
mark dutch, thank you very much for joining the live stream, my man
uh, s p 500 dumping? well, this means that it's very, very likely to dump
i did, i i didn't trade a short here on the s p i remember longing here
but, you know, we have a a pretty nice back pattern right over here
this was mentioned, you know, a couple of weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago, you know, looking for that rejection from this trend line, from these lower highs
you got perfect lower highs here, and you got this bat pattern that the ideal level would have been the two four thousand two hundred and thirty four thousand two hundred and fifty
it was also with this lower high level, you know, we've also had this major, major resistance zones, major candles here on the daily looking for a little bit higher than to have that this big, major drop
i did not short this, even though i was starting to be bearish, in between 4 200 and 4 250 points, i did not take the chance
and i was expecting, you know, a drop here on the s p 500, uh, didn't take the short position on the s p s p's, you know, like we said, uh, just yesterday, uh, i think it was yesterday, or before yesterday
so, yeah, this is very, very likely gonna have a larger, impulsive move to the downside
a shame, because i was a bearish, i was expecting this move to the downside
expecting very, very much this distribution event, explaining to, uh, the people that smart money is leaving the market at these spikes
all right, there's a lot of fear worldwide, because what is happening the, the, the, uh, in eastern europe, okay, that started in about march, approximately
a lot of fearful natural gas prices are going to go much, much higher
when there's fear, um, smart money is already, you know, getting the money out
that's why these spikes, i was talking about a distribution event here
i wasn't expecting this fourth pipe to spike, but anyway, uh, it's, you know, there was a fourth spike anyway
but this is when usually, the, the big money is actually taking profits
all right, there's, um, this was a a pretty nice kind of distribution event here
i think we can reach easily round about the six dollar or even the five dollar range in the next coming weeks
natural gas demand usually goes down in the start of the summer
so with that happening, you know, having a big, massive spike here in march
and this is only my analysis, but so far it is actually playing out pretty, pretty nice
this was mentioned, all right, this and kind of scenario was mentioned on the 3rd of june
okay, that was over 10 days ago, talking about this kind of distribution event, right, where the smart money is leaving and natural gas is poised for a correction
smart money does not buy at these high levels and does not create these spikes
primax btc is my favorite trading platform to trade any other assets
because a lot of you might think, isn't this a cryptocurrency channel? yeah, of course it is
this is the, this is the platform that i use to accumulate bitcoin
i'm currently right now and 1 500 worth of profit waiting for that low would i would have put more? of course yeah
but of course, i don't want to risk more than two percent of my capital
if not, it's, yeah, if you risk 10 or 20 of your capital, then, yeah, you it's not the way to trade
but uh, was very much waiting patiently for that drop on natural gas, knowing that smart money is leaving the market from this big, major uptrend that natural gas has had for the last few months, back to prime xbt
it's a platform that you use crypto as collateral, while you can trade over 50 different assets worldwide
you know nasdaq, dow jones, you name it, they have a bunch of assets
and you can use bitcoin, you can use ethereum, and you can use stable coins such as usdt and usdc as collateral if you don't want to use bitcoin or ethereum
but this is the platform that i am using to trade different assets to accumulate as much bitcoin as i can for the next few years, before the next big bull run
i've got a special bonus for you, which is over seven percent added to your deposit
okay? you deposit ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred dollars on top of that to trade with
you deposit a hundred thousand dollars, you're getting seven thousand dollars on top of that
all right, um, looking for that distribution event on natural gas
you can check it out here on a minute five from the third of june live stream
it happened a little bit later than expected, but it happened
i was shorting the natural gas, i didn't get stopped out in a small loss, and decided to reenter again, that this was just going to be another spike, something that i wanted to point out, guys, because if i'm trading something else, and i'm talking about something else, i need it, i need to say it, guys
i mean, there's something going on there, on on the telegram general chat
but, yeah, i mean, this is, yeah, something's going on there on the general jack
and also, before i go through the comment section, and we can take a look at some other cryptos, make sure, first of all, to absolutely destroy that like button, guys
and before i continue, guys, if you are interested in trading, of course, and you know, you, if you do have a buy bit account, make sure to join my team here
this means people, you know, are are pretty excited to join the bitcoin census team
let me just check here, double check that we are, how many people we are? we are 122 people at this moment
if you have a buy bit account and you are trading, you're actively trading, okay? or just, you know, having a few trades a week, whatever
we are, ma, we made a telegram group only for the people that are joining the bibic competition from the 25th of june, because competition starts on the 27th of june
from the 25th of june, two days before, we're gonna start sharing charts, sharing possible trades, you know, to enter stop loss risk management, you know, to make the biggest percentage trades
i'm telling you, i'm going to be, you know, giving it fullon on this competition, because i do want to finish at least in the top ten, if we can win the competition
i do know there is, you know, one group there i am, you know, i'm not scared, but i know they're gonna do well
uh, they're the one, they're the only ones that, i think, you know, they, they do have very, very high competition against us
the rest of them, i think they're not going to do absolutely anything
all of the rest of influencers are not going to do absolutely nothing, and we're going to absolutely crush it
there's only, uh, that only one team, chart champions team, that i think that can do a very, very, very well
make sure to join the telegram only for people that are joining the competition
this is, this is only a telegram group that's going to be open for the 20 days of the competition that starts on the 27th of june
andy says, um manatee, i do not want to take a look at chain link
i have a huge amount of chain link on my portfolio, and it's absolutely bleeding
you know, no matter how good your project is, no matter how bitcoin is digital digital gold, and it's going to be an inflation hedge
and no matter how big your project is, then, yeah, it doesn't really matter
but something interesting about chain link is that it is actually, you know, getting supported from this trend line
as you can see, you know, been bouncing every single time, you know, you cannot make this up, bouncing every single time from this trend line
you know, managed to hold it here, and it is holding right now at this level
you do not trade something the way you always bullish or always bearish
you need to be, you know, as a trader, you know, you need to be bullish and bearish, you know, every single day
i've just flipped a slightly bullish on bitcoin at this moment, just because of this, um, this kind of price action that we're creating
i'm staying a little bit cautious, staying a little bit cautious with this kind of movement
and, you know, the possibilities of going down here, yeah, they are high as well
what if i see a 50 50 probability trade? guess what i'm doing? yeah, yeah, you got it
are we going to create a lower high retest again? yeah, possibly
get get your popcorn emoji out if you want me to take a look at chain link
btc, stop crying, says andres kim, twenty thousand seven hundred dollars was the bottom
who knows? somebody shared in, the not the community or the modest chat, uh, a tweet of elon musk
i mean, uh, yeah, i can't share it right now because i don't know where it is, but, um, uh, come on, andy, act like a woman and trade without emotions
you got that right? mark dutch, um, do you believe we're in a liquidation hunt? uh, m sailor, and the the short of the shorts, yeah, exactly
i mean, there were some things that, you know, some rumors out there that, uh, you know, if bitcoin were to follow, it were to fall below 21 000, you know, a bunch of bitcoin, uh, michael sailors, bitcoin were gonna get liquidated
[Music], a bigger relief rally is is possible? bigger relief rally is possible here on ada
one of the reasons why is because we're retesting the lows, retesting the low area here
you just, you know, you just see here how ada is range trading in between the 66 cents, approximately, and the 46 cents, right? so you you can expect ada um to at least come to the 55 cent level in this relief rally
i would go, there's a double, i mean, double top scenario here
we are getting a large consolidation and getting a little bit of relief rally
if bitcoin does behave, if bitcoin does get a relief rally at least to that 55 cents, i do see ada coming to retest these lows
it's the 50 fibonacci retracement also, from this top to the low part
we're already getting a bounce here from this range, i think, higher
i think expect slightly higher on 88, before more continuation to the downside
you know, you got a little bit of nice, um, nice volume here with this, with this momentum to the upside
and a big level where the price could get rejected is the 55 cent
we've got a solid support level right over here on 88 at the 55 cents
it is the 50 fibonacci retracement from the drop created on the 8th of june
uh, expect a consolidation and potential rejection at that level on ada
currently getting rejected from this zone because of the spike here on the vpvr
we've got a spike here from the volume traded for the last month, approximately the last 30 days
and something really cool is that we do have nice spikes here on the vpvr
we have another spike here at the 55 cents, like i said, where we do have this consolidation
so it's going to be, you know, there are some opportunities here
there is a good, good levels here to take advantage from, in between 55 cents and 49 cents, in 50 cents, sorry, 50 cents and 55 cents range trading
uh, expect a little bit of a more relief rally to that range, 55 cents
but we know that a lot of people do have, you know, feelings, and they do get, uh, yeah, they basically don't like, uh, some some comments
but anyway, if i, i just, i just say, you know, you don't like it, you, you leave if you don't like with, you know, the kind of community that there is in here
of course, if you lose your their respect, then, yeah, it's, it's not good as a person
but, you know, we do have some pretty spicy jokes in the general chat of telegram
and currently we're having some, some issues with part of the team, with part of the community
and i, i just say, i would just say, hey, you don't like these spicy jokes, you can leave
this is always mission impossible, because i, i, i talk of my own things, my own analysis, and it's difficult to read most of the comments
but i'm telling you, this is the moment, this is the moment where the price of bitcoin can have a reversal, guys
this is not the moment to be bearish when the dxy has been pumping for the last one year and a half
okay? if we go to the daily this has gone absolutely parabolic
this will reach the end soon, when, i do not know if it's going to be in a week, if it's going to be in six months, but this will reach a peak
and this is not the moment to be bearish on bitcoin when you have the dxy going absolutely parabolic here, and also the bitcoin price having a big, aggressive drop
okay? it's been dropping now for several months, and the last two months have been absolutely insane, dropping from 50 000 all the way to 20 000 in just two months
and to call, i mean, i myself is making, i am making videos of, you know, potentially twelve thousand dollar bitcoin, potentially seventeen thousand dollars
but it is already, i am dollar cost averaging as much as much as i can right now at these levels, guys, because the reversal is very, very possible in the coming weeks, coming months, okay, it is possible
i am not sure for exact, uh, you know, i'm not really exactly, um, sure if we are gonna have a pretty sharp, vshape recovery on on bitcoin
you know, usually, you know, people that are analysts, people look at old data, what happened in the past, to figure out what could happen in the future
but, you know, usually it's, most of the times, it is not 100, you know, the case
and a lot of people are using, you know, last cycles, okay? and it's totally fine
it could happen, you know, you know, like this 200 weekly ema
you know, uh, we've lo we've hold the m a, you know, these moving average this, and i hate moving averages, the 200 moving average did hold the the last cycle here
the cycle in in 2015, the bear market in 2015, 200 weekly moving average, it did hold the price
okay, so here, yeah, uh, this is not exact science, we did, uh, actually dip below slightly
so, you know, as soon as we start dipping the low the 200 weekly moving average, you know, maybe below 20 000, maybe below 18 000, you know, will it be the lows? will it be the lows? what is happening with bitcoin? i remember hear people calling for one thousand dollar bitcoin
and a lot of people here, we reached about, you know, over three thousand dollar bitcoin
but i remember, you know, a thousand dollar bitcoin is imminent
i started investing in crypto here, a lot of people were calling for a thousand dollar bitcoin
so, a lot of people calling for nine thousand, ten thousand dollar bitcoin
you know, i do think that we could lose the alltime high a little bit, but it's gonna be
it's time to dollar cost average, i i think it's a little bit foolish if you are waiting for lower, you are waiting for lower
i had a, i had many friends that missed out big time in buying crypto
it's a very, very, very, very strong famous phrase, uh, from people that miss out, you know, waiting for lower
and this is what i'm going to do for the next, you know, couple of years, despite the price
mark dutch, what's going on in here? comment section, getting emotional
what's going on? uh, is he moving? is he using moving average? oh, my god, yes, yeah, yeah
i use moving averages like once a year, just because i see some people talk about it, and i think, okay, it's pretty interesting
you know, it is true that it has hold the range, but i think this time it probably won't
we actually going to dip below the moving average or not? um, right? so, um, yeah
you know, it is natural to have some haters, but i'm not gonna name anybody
you know, i go to different, i don't follow any youtubers really, but i do go to to watch, you know, see what they're talking about
and, you know, if i had bad comments, that would affect me a lot
i would be like, something, not, um, there's something that i'm not doing right here, because i get a huge amount, a bunch of bad comments
and, you know, it wouldn't make it, wouldn't make me want to continue here on youtube if i get bad comments
um, how long will you take to start going back up? how long will it take to, um, uh, to start going back up? i mean, this is the, uh, the crystal ball question, right? how long will it take till we start going back up? you know, if we, it all depends, it all depends
you know, fibonacci time here is a pretty good tool to to use to find out where the bottom can be, or where the next top can be
it's just, um, i i will actually make a video on fibonacci time, okay, explaining where the potential bottoms end peaks can be on bitcoin
it's not something that i'm going to do now, because now i want to go through the comment section
but i will make a video on fibonacci time, where we could expect the bitcoin price low levels
all right, what time frame do we have for a potential bottom on bitcoin before a big recovery? and also, and i'm already telling you, you know, these are already good accumulation levels
and also, where can we peak? i didn't think, i do think that i didn't make a video
i will try and find it, and and also make a video update, like today's video
you know, where it could be the bear market low? well, just using, you know, this 200 weekly moving average, and also using fibonacci retracement, you know, the fibonacci retracement
okay, from the bottom of uh of the cycle here, 2012, till the top of the cycle of 2014
if you take a look at fibonacci level, every single time, we have lost the 618 and actually dipped below the 78, the 078
fibonacci retracement every time on the bear market, from the ultimate low to the ultimate high
so if we take a look at fibonacci retracement from the low, i mean, this was explained on today's video, you know, the possibilities
it was holding the six, one, eight, six five for quite some time
so, you know, the losing the seven eight is very, very possible
so if we take a look at the ultimate low bear market levels from 2018 to the oldtime high, you know, we have actually lost the 618618 is lost
so possibilities in lower, for example, the seventeen thousand four hundred dollars, i think it is possible
people that are saying, three thousand dollar bitcoin, uh, nine thousand dollar bitcoin
dollar cost averaging at these levels is the best thing, in my personal opinion
so just a quick, just a tip here, just as an investment tip, right? not financial advice, because i'm also an investor
i'm going to trade now in the bear market because my portfolio is bleeding
so let's just, you know, accumulate, accumulate, accumulate, and also trade
what was the, uh, interest rate? uh, interest rates that time? wow
i can't remember what was the interest rates back here in 2018 and 2019
we could, i mean, we could have a quick look, but, yeah, and if i'm not going to have a look at that right now
there are some rumors, but you know the deal, when there's rumors about something, it's very unlikely to happen
i just want to have a big smile for the community on my thumbnails
and i actually used to do them, but i, i, you know, i learned that this is not the way because, yeah, people are not dumb
don't put any crazy thumbnails, and connect with the community
i mean, hopefully you are going to, you're going to follow the channel
maybe sometimes it's a little bit difficult, but i try and explain most of the movements and and support levels and trading opportunities risk management
but if you are new, i will be getting out after the summer, the most simple, most effective trading course with risk management that there is out there
because there is a lot of trading courses that are actually have too much information
i'm going to make such a short term one, you know, a short one, and make it nice and short and sweet, so you can be a profitable trader in in months
monk labs matic ta, please, absolutely enough of you know, i love you
well, i think we did actually take a look at matic, dude, not not too long ago
but a good accumulation zone on matic, you know, is round about, you know, the 20 cent level, 30 cent level, i'm sorry, between 20 cent and 40 cent is where we do have the biggest spike on the vpvr, because it was a pretty large accumulation zone here in april of 2021
let me just check here on matic, on another chart, we probably have some more price action
on this chart, with these colored boxes, i have absolutely no idea what they are with the different colors at the moment
let's, um, [Music] zoom in in here and and take a look at matic
i think the the the 20 25 level is very, very possible to be reached
um, in in may, it did have a, it had different price action from the rest of the altcoins, because, um, may went parabolic, and a lot of the all coins were already going sideways in may
and matic, in may, went absolutely parallel bollock, going from 70 cents all the way up to 280, when most of the altcoins were already getting exhaustion, right at the end of april, beginning of may
um, so, i mean, this is the thing here, automatic, i don't want to go too far off, too far off
i remember seeing matic at two cents back in 2020, but we're not going to go that far off
we would have to do a proper, proper, proper analysis, looking at fibonacci time, also on automatic
i mean, the price action of matic went pretty, pretty parabolic in january and february of 2021
it had a really, really fast price action going from two cents all the way up to 40 cents in just a couple of months
i i want to do a proper analysis here on matic, because we went up very, very fast
expect lower um but yeah, we can do a video on accumulation zone for some cryptos, accumulation areas
this is going to be a very good video that i will be doing before the end of the week, actually
i want to get potential, you know, with fibonacci time with bitcoin, you know, looking for for good accumulation levels
also, where could be the ultimate low level? i actually made that video today
so, yeah, i'm not going to take a video, i'm not going to make a video on that
uh, getting confused here with with potential videos that i want to do
but accumulation zones for all coins, right? so, good old coin projects, layer two solution for ethereum attic
in my, in my opinion, i think matic is still going to be here
so, where accumulation zones for all coins, such as chain link, such as matic, such as ethereum, you know, very good projects, okay, where we could find accumulation zone and bear market lows
um, but i can already tell you that matic is very likely going to meet the 30 cent level because we have lost a major resistance zone here
it might get a little larger relief rally, but continuation here to the downside is very, very possible
what would be the ideal scenario here? omatic would be actually creating kind of a descending triangle, you know, creating these spikes to the downside, right over here, okay, these slightly lower lows and and then get them and create kind of a descending triangle scenario, right? creating a kind of a descending triangle here in the next coming weeks, and then finally getting a pretty nice breakout
it's not the moment to be extremely bearish, uh, even though that we are expecting lower um, but, um, yeah
this is, i do think, round about the 30 cents in the coming weeks
is is very likely to happen, you know, with small relief rallies
uh, next pump, we are very, very likely going to get a lower high and continue down on matic
this was an insane support level back in march and april of 2021
cadena, i think it's an l1 project that might do, i think it will do well
there will be some l1 projects that will do well, and i think cadena is one of them
they have a pretty large community, some large investors behind them, partnerships
you know, i think they're just in development, and it's going to be one of those cryptos that will survive in the next coming years
i think cadena went all the way up to about, uh, twenty dollars, was it? it was around about twenty dollars, if i'm not mistaken
and you know this, if this goes sideways in the next coming months, it is going to be an accumulation zone, guys
this is classic, classic, 2018, 2019, you know, movement from a lot of altcoins
and, you know, if it starts going sideways, this is the moment when it starts going sideways, that you know you invest and you won't be down 50, you won't be down, you know, 80 percent of your investment, you know, from people that have invested here on cadena, for example, at, you know, 15 20, you you can invest pretty nicely here, because you are going sideways, right? and it's more comfortable to to to buy your cryptos at these levels
so, kadena, if we go sideways in the next couple of months, you know, i think cadena is already in pretty nice levels for accumulation
and also join the telegram only for people joining the competition
all right, extremely cautious, because i am out from my shorts
i made some nice profits on this quick, short accident here at 618, mentioned on the telegram group
i just like to say what i am doing sometimes this is clear signs of bearish exhaustion
okay? and a potential larger relief rally is very, very possible
now, this is not to create, you know, um, hopium or or foot of coming down
it's just, you know, to say, stay cautious here with your shorts or, you know, because a potential larger reversal after this aggressive drop
okay? people think now it's very impossible that bitcoin can be trading at 25 000
we were only trading there just, you know, yesterday we were trading, i was going to say a few days ago, but yesterday we were trading at, uh, 25 000
and these world series of trading is going to be in top 10, absolutely
you got that right, seb, we're gonna be in the top ten, no doubt in my mind
i'm gonna be extremely active, looking for those really good trading opportunities
guys, if you are interested, i'm super happy with, you know, my trade of today on bitcoin
you know, looking for that distribution, looking for that potential drop
uh, you know, by the beginning of the summer, natural gas demand goes down
um, people are too much panic of natural gas going to extremely high levels
and we have a pretty sharp correction where we can take advantage of the situation
you can see the natural gas trade here, average price from three trades in between the, uh, 870
was very, very, very much expecting this kind of drop on natural gas, and potentially even lower
i will be protecting my position, of course, but very, very much expecting this drop with this smart money leaving the market in this spikes
i did take some profit on the distribution event here on bitcoin
this is pure natural gas, pure natural gas right now, right over here
this is bitcoin here in in, you know, march, april of 2021, creating these slight, uh, higher highs
and interested in in trading some other other commodities, you got primex bt, and you got a huge bonus down below of seven percent, only for those experienced traders
come on, it is, uh, yeah, i gotta say this, of course, i do get a commission because i am promoting this platform, but it's a platform that i use almost every single day
of course, if you are following me, if we are community, okay, just use the best of the best
and the best of the best, for me is private bt and buybit where you have an insane bonus to be claimed down below
okay, guys, check out bitcoin sensors website for the latest news, technical analysis ideas
you know, we got, you know, stuff of dogecoin here, different articles, solana
check them out, guys, because it's just, you know, the latest information out there in crypto
join all our socials down below, and i will see you in the next one
in this episode, we're going to take a look at the bitcoin price to find out where the potential bottom can be
you must have heard about the 200 weekly moving average, where it has been the bottom on the last two cycles
well, i do think that will be and a great area for accumulation
we're also jumping here into the one hourly, also the four hourly chart
i'm going to show you these most important levels, why we're getting rejected from these ranges
okay? i'm going to explain to you right away in this episode and find out what could happen for bitcoin in the next coming hours and days
because what i want to show you here, the weekly chart, where can the bottom of bitcoin be for the next coming months? because it is likely that we are going to enter a massive accumulation zone, all right, for the next big bull run that might be in the next few years
now, you must have heard about this 200 weekly moving average, okay? 200 weekly moving average, you know, getting that bounce here from the low of the bear markets, from the last cycles, the cycle here in 2013 and 2014
as you can see, the lows did actually get that bounce, okay? this major moving average, 200 weekly, did get hold
and also in the last cycle, okay, in 2018, 2019, the bear market lows, all right, was also holding this range
so does this mean that this is going to hold this range this time? well, i think a lot of people are expecting this
so it's probably not going to hold, and we actually going to dip slightly below this range for quite some time
so that is just my theory, as in, you know, past performance doesn't mean, you know, future events, of course
and because of the current world situation, you know, and the massive panic that there is worldwide, well, there possibly could be much lower levels for bitcoin
okay, how you know on the last cycles? if we do take a look at the bear market lows from each cycle, okay? first cycle was or over here, 20 in 2010 until 2011
and the bear market lows was in late 2011, right where we saw this big, massive cycle, okay, to the to the upside from 2012 all the way to late 2013
so if we do take a look at fibonacci retracement, okay, from the low part to the highs, as you can see here, and this is the logarithmic chart, this is why you can see fibonacci like this
now, you can see that we actually dipped below the seven eight, okay, the 078 fibonacci
and it stays above the point 88, as you can see here on the chart
so we did actually, but, um, the 618 did hold here for quite a little bit
we did get actually, about from that range as soon as we lost the 618, we were actually hitting the 7 8 and the 088, as you can see, staying in between this range and finally getting that run to the upside the years after that
okay? the bear market lows from this cycle of 2013 was here in uh early 2015
as you can see, from early 2015 till mid 2015 is where we bottomed out
so just to let you know, that 088 and 078, right? we actually dipped below the 078
so if we take a look at the extreme low levels from the next cycle, it was right over here, from 2015
all right? and if we take a look at fibonacci retracement from the ultimate lows of this bear market to the alltime high, same scenario happened right over here
we were actually getting these bouncers and holding the range
as soon as we lost the 618 level here, as you can see from the dip from december november sorry of 2018, we actually went to the 78 and dipped below
we were trading in between these two fib levels round about the center just like the last cycle, okay, from 2013
they actually lost the 078 fibonacci retracement from the ultimate low to the high
okay? so as just for a quick reminder here, from the ultimate low to the high, we lost the point 78 fibonacci retracement from this low to the alltime high
so if we do take a look at the ultimate low from the last cycle bear market, which was right over here in december of 2018, and we take a look at the fib level from the low to the alltime high, you can see here on the weekly you know, this point seven, this point, uh, six one eight, the six one eight fibonacci retracement
but what is happening right now is that we've lost the most important fibonacci retracement, the 618
so this is telling me, if we take a look at the other cycles, it is very, very likely to have some more downside action
the 078 fibonacci retracement is at 17 300 range, and the point 88 is at 10 800, as you can see here on the chart
so it's very, very likely that we are, potentially, if we're going to sit take a look at the ultimate low from the bear market to the alltime high from last cycles, we were trading in between the 7 8 and the 088 fibonacci retracement
and that is in between ten thousand and seventeen thousand dollar range
meaning that it's very, very likely that we're actually going to lose the alltime high resistance and dip below this range
if we are going to be trading in between 17 000 and 10 000 in the next coming weeks and months, guys, it's going to be a very, very good um accumulation zone, in my personal opinion
now we're going to go through the sponsor segment of this video

and they do support over a hundred thousand trades per second
what are these levels that are getting respected here on the one hourly chart? very, very nicely? well, these are daily levels
we had a pretty pretty aggressive drop, okay? before yesterday
and the reason why we are getting rejected from this major level is, i'm going to explain to you right away
if we zoom out on the daily chart, these are two major daily levels from december of 2020
so if i fast forward in the price action of bitcoin, looking at the one hourly chart, they're actually being very well respected
you are wicking above them and below them, but they are getting very well respected
and the reason why this level is actually holding as resistance
okay? the daily closers from december of 2020, you can check it out for yourself, just like i showed you right over here, getting very well respected as support and very well respected as resistance
this is why it is highly probable that the bitcoin price is probably going to continue to the downside, to retest the low 20 000 range in the next coming hours, next few days
if i take a look at fibonacci retracement here on the one hourly from these highs to the lows, you can clearly see also, the 61865 is holding very strongly as resistance
it's very likely to continue back down to round about the 21, 20 000 range in the next coming hours, potentially, all depending on how aggressive this drop is going to be
i think the retest here of the 21 000 range is almost imminent
okay, then possibly we could create a double bottom, or we could actually break this low if we continue back down
okay? if i do zoom out on the full hourly, this major level, remember, was the alltime high in the bull market of 2017
and it was also a major consolidation that we did have in november and december before actually breaking the zone
here is the nineteen thousand four hundred and thirty dollars
if we zoom, okay, into the bitcoin price, to the current price action
if we start losing these major lows, the 20 800 low that we did create early this morning, then we can expect a major hit at 19 400, where the price could potentially get a shortterm, shortterm bounce
this is going to be it for today's episode guys, showing you some major levels where we're going to get rejected
these relief rallies are getting major resistance from these daily levels
we'll be doing a live stream afterwards to find out some major opportunities
check out bitcoin center website for the latest news and technical analysis ideas
in today's episode, i'll show you my first ever trade that i took on chain link
i do have my take profit at three point five hundred and sixty
i am also in a cell position on ethereum, and we are slightly at my where we are exactly at my entry right now, at 1 212
and i'll show you exactly why i took this trade right now, on chain link and on ethereum
we're looking at the trade that we took this morning on ethereum
and we are slightly below the support right now, uh, or sorry
and we're also below the entry that i took today at 1212 when it comes to ethereum um, i'm gonna show you on uh, trading view soon, exactly why i took this trade
i do expect a big drop on this one, or i'm just gonna swing trade it
and i also took this trade during the morning live stream that we did have, so it was around these candlesticks
and so, yeah, i do have my, i mean, a one percent position on link and one on on ethereum
and yeah, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
you also know by now that you can have it somewhere here in the corner
and this is the great thing, because, for example, now, when i'm gonna have my long short positions for a little bit of a longer time, the fees is very good when it comes to that
we can obviously see that we do have a heavily dropped we are in between key levels on ethereum at 1330 and 1313
what i did was that i took a fibonacci from 1350 back down to the support at 1 000 and 100
what the market gave me was the fibonacci levels 1254 and 1223
and what i also did was that i did highlight this previous resistance that we you can see how many times we have
so many weeks i when i saw the market, we were around this level
so it was after this huge candlestick, we saw the market came but we saw the market drop
and another thing, so remember now that we do have the one hourly fibonacci
what we also can do is that we use the support trendline, obviously
another thing, we drag the fibonacci again, from 1238 back down to 1155
and you can see that with this, uh, we did break through it a little bit
so remember, we most of the time, um, when you see the second leg being below the first leg, this is the first leg
you will see, usually this is what happens, at least that you'll see the drop
so the market, we have one new hourly candle opening, so we just might see some movements to the upside
i do have my st i do have my stop loss above the 618, because i do expect the market can definitely be a little bit volatile
we can come up, as i told you, retest the 618 percent too, and then see the continuation of the drop
as you can see, we do have one new hourly candle opening, so we can look and see, we do have a pretty huge candlestick right here
and but one of the things that we also can have in mind if we go to the higher time frames
okay? we see the market going in a sideways market, and we came back down and retested the key level and 1130 gold
we can see how it looks on the daily so now i'm just going to show you exactly what i see
okay, so one thing that definitely can happen is that, because we did come back down and retested 1 13, and this is why we see the market giving us a little pullback right now
if the stoploss would potentially get hit on my trade, what we can do is that would drag the fibonacci back up to 1525
you can see that the 50 is just combined, combined exactly with the 1330 key level
so if we were to see the market now pull back up, because this can definitely happen, we can see a retest off this level and then a potential drop, this is what i look for, at least if we would see the market break
as you can see, we are right now, uh, retesting this previous resistance one more time and go
so we can come back up and retest this level and then see the market fill this week
and hopefully you'll see the market slowly and steady reach down to my target
but remember, we can definitely come back up and retest this level at 1227 one more time before you see the drop
because remember, we're coming with a or not, remember, but we're retesting the level, and we're closed with a inverted handler, which i told you is a bearish reversal pattern
this is, for me, a sign that we're actually going down on ethereum
what? this is the first time i, i've ever triggered chain link, which i think is pretty exciting because, um, i've been back testing them so much during all of the live streams that i do have
and i actually like all coins overall, because i know a lot of people say that they are pretty hard to trade, but they respect mark structure and fibonacci levels really good
obviously, you need to know exactly how to analyze them, obviously, but i actually like it
and during at this morning live stream, i i saw it, i ate position, so i took it and just, uh, it's gonna be exciting to see if this is gonna be a a take profit trade or a stoploss trade
and we can right now see the market came back up and retested this level
so what we also can and what i also did, was that i took a fibonacci from seven dollars back down to 546
and on the lower time frames, i obviously sold the market around these levels during this morning live stream that we also did
i've already done this, and we did break above the fibonacci that i took from 640 back down to, uh, to six dollars
we're retesting the previous support and the 618 percent right now
and my take profit on link, as i told you beginning of the video, is 3560
remember, this is a key level, which is really important for us to use
i'm gonna take this fibonacci away, and i'm gonna just show you another one
and we are right now retesting the fibonacci level one more time
we came back up and retested also, a previous support that we did break, came back up, created a lower high
if this will be valid, take profit one on bitcoin will be 20 140
take profit to 18 607, and say profit three will be seventy thousand three hundred and thirty
so i do expect the market to give us a bigger drop right now, uh, because the market is obviously just pushing back down
and, um, but, i mean, we can also just come back down to twenty one, 21 040
so when when i'm in trades, i just move my stop loss more and more and more, so i'm always in profit or a break even, so you you never lose anything on your account
you can also see on bitcoin that we do have this inverted or hanging man
so this is a bearish reversal pattern that we got inside the fibonacci, which is really important for us to use as a um as a confirmation to sell the market
remember that when we choose to go into retreat, we also choose to lose money on our accounts
so when we decide to trick to or when i decide to take a trade, i just leave it
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
hit the notification so you know when i do have my daily updates or my live streams, i will have a live stream a couple of hours after this video
and we see each other in the live stream, or next live stream, or the next video we see each other
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
i'm so happy that we, that we do have so many people on this live stream
how are you? please, as i told you, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that so you can help me to grow the channel and reach out to more people
uh, well, first of all, what is it? is it tuesday today? 14, it's tuesday today
charts in the price of finnish goods and service sold by producers
um, so yesterday i gave you some key levels, and the market did respect the key levels very, very good, as you can as you can see
i was actually in a buy position yesterday, but my stoploss got hit because, yeah, the market dropped, obviously
if you hear some things in the background, it's because they are, um, doing some things around the building
um, do you think bitcoin find its bottom? i don't know exactly
hello, matthew, how are you? okay, so looking at dxi, where we are coming back up to a previous, we're just coming up to another level around 105526
the only thing that can happen, or not only thing, but one of the things
we're coming up to retest a previous monthly, little lower low
so i told us, as i told you, it's pretty hard to we're just looking at it
if we say pull back, which can happen now, and drag people notch from the low to the high, and we can come back down to fibonacci level, 103845 and 103525
if you go to bitcoin, we do have, we just might also have a pullback now then, but to what level? look at the data
i mean, of course, two days right? okay? we came back down and retested key level 21 040 yesterday
when the market looked like this, well, we tried to follow the trend, right? this fibonacci could be valid
we did break above it a little bit, but you can use this previous low right here, connect it with the 50
if we break below this trend line, if you break below this trend line, that would you have um i connected with the support, uh, with the lower highs
if we break below it, and see retest from below, this is where i'm gonna sell the market, when the lower high is created
and we do have the 15 61 percent that we can also use from switch 2593 and 22 247
but first of all, i need to wait for the market to to break the level
so i do have a, i do have a an alert on bitcoin of the support if it got, if it gets broken, because the market is obviously going down
um, i want to see the break of the trend line, the retest and then the potential drop
if you haven't already liked live stream, please go inside and do that
don't forget that you can also receive a, oh, a bonus on vibe
it's up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
uh, by bit is super great when it comes to, especially um, swing trading
and you're also supporting with the senses in me by doing that
i will go to ethereum, now, what's this? which one? and i will do the same thing
so we um, okay, so we did retest the key levels, um, perfectly yesterday
um, why are you this much lovely with amazing analysts on the market? well, thank you so much, fareed
oh, what? 20? i just, uh, okay, so i just saw the market right now on, uh, sorry, on ethereum
okay, so i'm gonna put the chat on hold because we do have some spammers, and i don't have any moderators today
so please, guys, i will put everything on hold so they cannot spam the chat
i don't have time for that kind of bs um, because this is trading
um, if someone, um wants to act like a child, they can do that
i told you i was, um, i saw the market right now on ethereum, um, so this is kind of a little bit more aggressive from my side because, um, i, i use it from the fibonacci right now that we came back up and retested
but we can also wait for the market to break this, uh, support trend line the same way that we wanted, uh, bitcoin to do, right? so put i do also have an alert in case
if not, my stop loss can be taken, because that can obviously happen
because always remember that when we're trading the market, we always go in with a with a risk
so i'm using the key level, the next key level, as a i say, take profit, um
so if nas reaches up to eleven thousand six hundred and thirty, i will have a notification
and if this trade is valid, if these fibonacci levels between, uh, 11 637 and 11 hundred, i'll take profit
one would be eleven thousand two hundred, ten thousand eight hundred and eighty eight and ten thousand six hundred
and um, [Music], ten thousand and six hundred will be the um three, take profits on nas
i think this actually will be a very good, this will actually be a very good setup when it comes to nas
spx, if this will not be valid, i want to see, first of all, with this one, if we break below, if we break below the 3790, the market will give me a notification
in case these fibonacci will be valid, we'll see a break read this from below, and that could take us, take us, uh, back down
um, take profit one, three thousand seven hundred and thirty five
i'm just gonna go and see ethereum, we're retesting the 50 right now
i can't do anything about people being i think, i know, i i i think i seriously know what's going on right here, guys
so edgardo, even though i'm no financial advisor, but a pullback, potentially to 675 or 696 can be where we potentially can see market pullback up to
well, it looks kind of good, right? you see the market broke the a little trend line right here
so if we see that the market right now, it's breaking this support trend line, we can have a, see, we can also have it re but i still wanted to to, um, break the support framework, right? break the support trendline and create a, okay, the the last higher lowest, technically around 585, if you're looking at the five minutes
but if we break it and see retest from below, and we're closing below the previous high, and we can potentially read test 618 again
take profit two will be 528, and take profit three will be 495
how are you? uh, i also saw that someone wanted me to look at solana
this is a, um, previous report where you saw the market have a big, had a big bounce, right? okay, so bitcoin is going down, going down to the lower time frames
just to see what's actually happening, because we do have a little pullback dragon fibonacci from 339 to 5
and you can, you can see that we we are only retesting the 50 at the moment
so i would say, if we see the market break, we just might come back up and retest 31242
but if we see the break of this previous little higher low on the 50 minutes chart, we can see a break and potential weakness of this previous little low
yeah, the fifty percent again, at thirty thousand and thirty seven
uh, these are a little bit far down because it's a four hourly fibonacci
take profit three, um, i would say 2455, because that is the high of the week
i think it's a group that tries to attack my channel at the moment with very nasty names
um, i can't really do much more than just, you know, hide them from the channel
when people feel like they need to do this, they obviously want to, you know, make a statement of something
you know what i'm gonna okay, so we're just going to change the fibonacci up to 377, to 8 instead, to see if the, so we can reach the 3221 or 3358 instead
because, remember, the market, even if we say pull back right now, um, we can just come to another lower high level and then see the market reverse back down
um, so i would just see if we come back up and retest 3225 or potentially 3358
i'm not gonna change my, my, my, my trade on ethereum, not yet
natalie, you have brightening my morning for the second day or road, despite the third bitcoin price
i do this morning live streams every single morning from 8 am, swedish time, so one hour before london session
so if you haven't subscribed to the channel, hit the notifications so you can do that
we're looking at the morning or i do have the morning live streams because i want to have an overview of what the market is actually doing, or what levels we can see the market retesting during the day
if you are if you want to learn more how to trade yourself, i have a very good a couple of videos
you can check this on everything that i show you on my videos
you can do this on four experience in that you can do this on every chart
i do have some videos where i've been back testing um, and i just show you what i see on the charts
and it's always good to add that to your own technical analysis
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
um, i let's see if we can have some, if i can change the chat now we have, we have the the group of spammers right here now that try to prove a point about something
uh, if there's anything that you want to say, i'm glad my brain is better than some people in this room
please, uh, like the video so you can help me reach out to more people, so we can let people see how, how we can look at the charts in it from a different point of view
and so, yeah, okay, so look, we do have, but do we have anything today? good to see you too, daniel
tuesday, we don't have anything special, but we do have a pullback though
but 2 30 pm is something that, uh, we need to look at, um, looking at ethereum again before i go
so on ethereum, we are inside a fibonacci level um, 1222 and 1250 and 200 120
so we can expect, this is also something, i mean, we can also, let's see
okay, so if this fibonacci will not be valid, we do have a pretty huge candlestick on the one hour, last hourly
on the lower time frames, we can see that we do have, uh, we have one big candle
and then we start to have small dojis on the lower time frames
um, but if we would see some more momentum to the upside, we can drag fibonacci on ethereum, back up to 1524
and the same thing here, because the market is obviously going down
so we just might see the market come back up, and then you see the drop
i want to see how the market is looking if that will be the case
but first of all, we're going to drag the fibonacci back down to this level
but we came back down, and we tested one thousand one hundred and thirty
it's easier to see what's happening on the lower time frames, actually
and then, eglda, chain link, we can go to chain link, link here
[Music], okay, so we we are below a previous support, and that is between 657 and 642
and if we drag fibonacci from 703 to 546, we are right now retesting the previous support that we did break
is that six point forty two fifty percent at six point twenty? was it twenty four? ten twenty four? and you can already see that we start to have some um, the market starts to retest this level
if this is the case long term, uh, not long term, but this could actually happen
take profit to 430, and take profit 3, 357 could be on, uh, chain link
so we can from this level, no, a long position, short position, you can have it
i could have it slightly above the the the support that we did break at 662
so i'm gonna sell the market right now on chain link, because it actually looks very good
we came back up to the previous report, retested it now as the resistance
i actually, i actually like, um, if you beginners buy the sales of market, hold and watch the face of natalie live
um, i actually, the thing is that when it comes to all coins overall, i actually kind of like them
um, i'm not gonna lie, because i've been, you know, i backed us these every single day
and every time, most of the time, when we come back on my on my analyzes, then we've actually seen the market, um, retesting this level
let's see how it's gonna go with this one's babies, right? we're going down a little bit
i mean, one position on link now and one position on on ethereum, sorry
if you would choose to do this yourself, remember that stop loss can be hit
so when we're going to the to a trade, um, we always, we always, always go in with the um, mindset that we know that we can lose these money, right? so we always have to be very care not careful, just going, you know what? when you take a decision and you're going to trade, you take the decision, just leave it if stop us, get hit
we cannot go into it to trade and be like, oh, no, i'm gonna lose the money
no one cares about these types of emotions, right? don't feel sorry for yourself
if, if, if you do trading is too tough for you, then, okay, i'm just gonna be straight up honest with you
if you, if you cannot control the emotions, you should not trade
and you should definitely not take my trades just because i show it
stacy, hey, i was looking at you the euro usd trade a couple of days ago, and all the take profits got hits, and you were on the live stream, and then i showed it, and then you were not on the live stream
i think it was that shade that you that we looked at together a couple of days ago
looking at gala, we're, we're coming back up and potentially retest the support at 6985
i don't know if you're a man woman, or, i don't know, i fell asleep
if we break below the support trend line, which is pretty important
if we break below this level, potentially we test, we can come back, come back up
and we test the fifty percent at six thousand four hundred and fifty eight, and then see the drop
take profit to 5070, and take profit three, four thousand seven hundred in case
um, so, yeah, if you don't see the market pull back up and at 6975, because that is the previous, uh, support that we did break
oh, okay, let's see, link is going up to the to the entry again
um, but remember that we are below a previous support that we're retesting right now
so usually what i do, if i see the market have some volatility, and i see potentially the market can come back and retest another level, i can, i i move my sorry, guys, i'm so sorry
hit the notification so you know when i am live, because i'm gonna have a live stream today
as i told you, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and one at four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below, the video
don't be mean to other people, because karma's gonna come back and get to you
and you know, karma is only there for you to put you to a position where you put other people in the position
my name is josh, and right now there's a lot of uncertainty in the market due to the fact that we have a fed meeting coming up in less than 24 hours
so in just a moment, i'll be explaining exactly what this means for market
and i'll also be covering, of course, bitcoin and ethereum later in this video
and towards the end of this video, i'll be giving you an update on the celsius situation, which is very important for all crypto holders
just starting off the video talking about the fed meeting, which is due to happen in less than 24 hours
in fact, the exact time it's meant to happen is 6 pm gmt time
and in fact, at 6 00 pm on the 15th of june gmt time, which is tomorrow, we're not only getting the fed's interest rate decision, we're also getting multiple projections
and at 6 30 pm gmt time tomorrow, we're getting the usual fed press conference where we hear jerome powell, who is the chair of the federal reserve, speak
and sometimes there's some valuable things that jerome powell says in that press conference, which i'll be sure to cover on my twitter in real time if there is anything valuable
but of course, the fed's interest rate decision is really the most important thing out of this fed meeting
and before last friday, when inflation came in a lot hotter than expected and actually broke into new highs, the majority of market participants were expecting and planning for a 50 basis point hike, which is a half a percent
but with the cpi data for the month of may that came in just on friday, and because of the fact that we now know inflation definitely did not peak in march, like a jerome power originally said, and instead, it is only potentially getting worse
we might end up seeing a 75 basis point hike due to this bad outcome in inflation
and ever since we got this bad inflation figure last friday, there's been a lot of investors starting to price in a potential 75 basis point hike, which is why, between friday and right now, we've been seeing a lot of bearish price action in the stock market
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and once again, you can clearly see that recently, especially since the end of last week, we've seen a lot more bearish price action, which, like i said, this could potentially be investors starting to price in a potential 75 basis point hike ever since we got that higher than expected inflation figure right around here
but with that being said, it's unlikely that every single investor has priced in a 75 basis point hike, which means if we do end up seeing a 75 basis point hike, we could see another shortterm dump for the stock market, which could also transfer over to crypto
but on the flip side, if we somehow, and honestly, i don't know how this would happen, but if we somehow see a 50 basis point hike, then that would actually be a bullish signal in the short term
and we could see a decent rally in the stock market and in crypto if we see a 50 basis point hike
but the only problem with that is inflation would likely get even worse if we only see a 50 basis point hike
and of course, we just need to wait and see what happens tomorrow with the fed meeting
and of course, i'll be sure to keep you updated in these videos and in real time over on my twitter as soon as the numbers come out
so if you do not follow me over on my twitter, make sure you're doing that
and the link to my twitter is in the description down below, and also in the pinned comment
this right here is the bitcoin to yours dollar chart on the weekly time frame
and right now we're trading around that 200 week moving average, which is sitting in between 22k to 23k
and as the regular viewers here on the channel would already know by now, this 200 week moving average, the red line, usually is around the bottom for the bitcoin price during major bear markets and crashes
but as i've also previously mentioned on this channel, from time to time we do have the rare occasion where we might see a week below the 200 week moving average, like what we saw in march 2020
at that stage during that crash, the 200 week moving average was coming into play at around five and a half thousand, but the bitcoin price actually crashed down towards around 38k to 39 k
but then we ended up closing that weekly candle much closer to the 200 week moving average
and in fact, even in that case, we saw the weekly candle close slightly below the 200 week moving average because that weekly candle close was coming into play at around 53 k, while the 200 week moving average was coming to play at around five and a half thousands
so this march 2020 example shows us that it's not the end of the world if we do see a quick crash below the 200week moving average, for as long as we see the weekly cattle close up towards the 200week moving average
but for the most part, according to bitcoin's entire price history, if you've delecos average into bitcoin around that 200week moving average, you've done extremely well over the longer term
and another moving average we could pay attention to is the 300 week moving average, which is this blue line right here
because it was this 300 week moving average that marks the actual bottom for the march 2020 crash, even the bottom of the week
and now i want to make it clear that i'm not saying bitcoin's guaranteed to go down to that 300 week moving average
i'm just saying that is what happened during the march 2020 crash, which is why we should keep an eye on this moving average
and right now, this 300 week moving average is coming in at around 17 000 per bitcoin
but like i said, we've only seen just one extremely rare occurrence where we've seen the bitcoin price hit that 300 week moving average
and something else that we also have to keep in mind is the fact that the weekly bitcoin rsi is currently well and truly entering into oversold territories for the first time since the end of the 2018 bear market
and in fact, right now we're actually more oversold, according to the weekly bitcoin rsi, than what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market according to the rsi, once again
and now giving you a quick update on the bitcoin long positions over on the bitfenix exchange, which are basically holding up at around the same sort of level as what they were sitting at yesterday
and as for everything else around bitcoin, nothing much has happened since yesterday
so if you missed my last video on the channel, definitely check that one out
and now getting into the ethereum parts of this video, this right here is the ethereum to us dollar chart on the weekly time frame
in fact, right now, the weekly ethereum rsi is currently at its lowest level we've ever seen before
seriously, right now, it's lower than what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear markets
and that was the only other time where we've seen the weekly ethereum rsi enter into oversold territories
and right now we're even more oversold than what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market
so this signal alone tells us that we should be due for some sort of relief rally, at the very least within the next one month or so, likely this month
but once again, i want to make it clear that this is not a shortterm signal for ethereum
this is a much longerterm ethereum signal like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear markets
because back then, the moments the weekly ethereum rsi entered into oversold territories, we still had another three more weeks worth of bearish press action before then we had a decent relief rally for ethereum
and right now, this 382 fibonacci level, which is the second most important fibonacci level, is providing perfect support for ethereum
more specifically, it's coming into play at around 1060, approximately
so as of right now, that is still the level of support that i am paying strong attention to
and something else that i'm paying strong attention to is the ethereum short positions on the bitfenix exchange, which are still dropping
and just today alone, we've seen another 71 k ethereum leave short positions on this particular exchange, which is equivalent to around 8 million us
and of course, that is on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ethereum short positions that have closed already over the past few weeks
and once again, if you have no idea what this means, definitely watch my last video on the channel, because in that video i went into much more detail about all of this and what it means for ethereum
and now giving you an update for ethereum versus bitcoin here on the weekly timeframe
and if you're looking at the weekly rsi for ethereum for bitcoin, this is actually getting really close to oversold territories
and in fact, right now it's basically scraping along oversold territories
but if you're looking back at the 2018 bear markets, that is what we saw towards the end of the 2018 bear market, right around here
but ethereum versus bitcoin still had one more significant drop to the downside before then it bottomed out after we already saw a relief rally after the bear market
because basically during this time period, right here, in early 2019, bitcoin was outperforming ethereum to the upside
and so based on the weekly ethereum versus bitcoin rsi getting very close to oversold territories, we could see limited downside price action for ethereum versus bitcoin
in the somewhat shorter term, like what we saw during q4 of 2018
but we could still end up having one more decent lake to the downside, especially considering the fact that we do have wyckoff distribution playing out right now, which is, of course, a significant bearish pattern
and also, we potentially have a massive bump and run reversal pattern forming right now
and this type of pattern is basically a threestage bearish pattern
first of all, we have the leadin phase for the pattern, and then we have the bump phase
and then if the price simply breaks this upwarding line of support, which is coming into play at around 0048 bitcoin per ethereum, then in that case, that is when we could see a further reversal for ethereum versus bitcoin
and technically speaking, the price target for a bump and run reversal pattern is towards the beginning of the leading phase, which in this case is basically the 2019 and 2020 bottom
but honestly, even though i am expecting more of a pullback for ethereum versus bitcoin, i wouldn't exactly be betting on seeing those lows again like what we saw in 2019 and 2020
but that would obviously be a massive move for ethereum vs bitcoin
and to see that play out, we probably need to see more confluence around those lower price targets on top of just this one single pattern
this one single pattern by itself is probably not enough confluence to be targeting prices that low
but of course, this is still something to keep in mind moving forward
and now giving you an important update on the celsius situation, because since my last video that i posted yesterday on the channel, celsius has actually added another 2 000 bitcoin, or technically wrapped bitcoin, to their collateral for this loan
and the reason why they did that is to simply lower their liquidation price for this loan
but on top of adding an extra 2 000 bitcoin as collateral, over the past one day, they've also paid down their loan by 47 million us
and by doing that, they further lowered their liquidation price over the past 24 hours
and in fact, if you watched my video yesterday, the liquidation price just yesterday was at around 18 and a half thousand bitcoin
and a day before that, just before they stopped withdrawals, it was at around 22 to 23 000 per bitcoin
which means if they did not stop withdrawals, and if they just let this loan go astray, then by now, the liquidation price would have already been triggered
because once again, just a couple days ago, this was at around 22 to 23 000 per bitcoin
but right now it's sitting down towards 14 000 per bitcoin, which is good to see
and in case you're wondering what all of this means, basically, celsius has around half a billion dollars worth of bitcoin as collateral locked up in his loan
and basically, if the bitcoin price goes below 14 000 at the moment, is their liquidation price
basically, if the price of bitcoin goes below their liquidation price, whatever it is at that time, then this collateral begins to get liquidated, which is around 24 000 bitcoin that are potentially getting dumped onto the market if the bitcoin price triggers that liquidation price
so with that in mind, the lower their liquidation price is, the better that is
because if their liquidation price is very low, then that will decrease their chances of getting liquidated
but ideally, it would obviously be great to see if celsius can just pay down this loan as much as possible, so then there's less overall risk of celsius potentially going under
and if you want more information about this entire situation, check out my last video on the channel
and also, if you want to stay up to date in the crypto markets at all times and stay up to date on this celsius situation, make sure to follow me over on my twitter because i've been posting realtime updates over there, as you can see right here
and make sure to check out this video popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to maximize your profits in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
welcome back to another ta episode on the bitcoin on chain metrics
so in today's video, tick tock, next block, we're going to be talking about a plethora of onchain metrics from the hashrate, hashrate distribution, the network difficulty, fees per transaction, confirmed fees, confirmed payments and unique addresses used
to start off with, you might be thinking, tick tock, next block
well, if we look at the bitcoin price, the bitcoin price has been massively cascading to the downside for the past couple of months to year
now, while the price has been moving to the downside, the onchain metrics have been diverging, and the network is becoming more valuable
so if we look at the hash rate, we're having a massive, massive bullish divergence from the bitcoin price
why do we care about the bitcoin hash rate? well, the hash rate is a much better indicator at judging the value of the bitcoin network
now, the bitcoin price is simply the function of its supply and demand
however, when we look at the total hash rate, this is a perfect, perfect indicator to judge the value of the network
why is this? because if the hash rate was at zero or if the hash rate was really low, this would mean that bitcoin would be highly centralized, because there are not many people mining bitcoin
subsequently, there are less miners validating transactions, and the hash rate would be lower
when the hash rate increases, it means that the network becomes more decentralized
there are more people using the network, there are more people mining the network, and thus the value of the network increases
and i made a video about the hash rate the other day, and it did come up and make a new alltime high, which is absolutely beautiful
you can see, in local terms, bitcoins coming down, making local lows
in all time terms, the hash rate is coming up and making alltime highs
now if we plot this on the raw values, specifically, looking at the past 30 days, you can see up here at 266, this was the total alltime high for the hash rate
and since then we have started to move down a bit, still making higher lows
i would like to emphasize it really doesn't matter if bitcoin's making new alltime highs on the total hash rate every day
if we look at the seven day moving average, or higher moving averages, you can see that we are still pushing up into alltime highs in terms of the moving average
and i think it's important to plot this on a moving average scale, because when we plot raw values, you can very much see this, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, but it's still a steady increase to the upside
so when we look at this in terms of our moving averages, 30 day is coming up to new alltime highs
seven day is currently pushing into new alltime highs, which is absolutely great
once again, the price is simply a function of the supply and the demand of bitcoin at that moment in time
the hash rate is a much better indicator of the bitcoin network's value
let's move on to the next indicator, and this is the hash rate distribution, meaning the amount of miners mining and validating transactions
now, the hash rate distribution, what i want to say about this is this is becoming more and more decentralized over time
and we'll jump into the hash rate distribution over time in just one moment
but as you can see here, the amount of validators, you know, and pool being the highest
now, you would need more than 51 to stage an attack on the bitcoin network
because not only do you need 15, what 51 of the network, you need to have a 51 attack and mine two bitcoin blocks back to back
you know, you can have a 51 attack, but you need, in order to attack the network, you would need to submit an incorrect version, or you you would submit a fake version of the bitcoin blockchain within one block, and you would hope that that block that you mind is the one that goes through
and then subsequently, you would need to edit another block, the next one over
and you would be hoping that you can mine two blocks back to back in order to create what is known as a double spend, which is the problem that bitcoin tries to solve
if you haven't read the bitcoin net, the bitcoin white paper already, and you are invested in the network, i love you
but what are you doing? i have made a audio book on my channel, where you can simply click on my playlist, go over to the bitcoin audiobook, click it sit back, grab a beer for 25 minutes and listen to me read through the, uh, read through the entirety of the bitcoin white paper
so i definitely recommend that if you haven't already read it, that you definitely read it, or listen to an audiobook
but that being said, the hashtag is very, very decentralized, and it does not look like there's any chance of a 51 attack attack coming into fruition
but with that being said, not only would you need 51 of the mining power, not only would you have to mine two blocks back to back and submit your own edited version of the bitcoin ledger within both of those transactions, it's not even as easy as that
you would also need to compete with the longest chain, which in the bitcoin white paper is referred to as honest chains
now within the honest chains, you would have to have been mining bitcoin blocks for years and years and years to compete with currently honest nodes
now with that being said, let's move on from the hash rate distribution
so what you'll notice with this one as well, uh, is that the hash rate distribution no matter what you're in, whether it's btccom others and pool, etc, these are all going down very, very fast over time
now, poland, this is one of the ones that has managed to stay, uh, relatively relatively flat, which is somewhat impressive
but the rest of them, you can see, are all diminishing over time
and predominantly, they're going down, meaning that other other people are competing for the hash rate
individuals are setting up their own bitcoin nodes and validating, uh, you know, their own transactions
so it's going to become harder and harder and harder over time to stage a 51 attack and, you know, take over the network
now, with that being said, as well, you may notice there is a large chunk of the network in the unknown pool
it says over here, um, it simply means that they are unable to determine the origin
so for example, if i was to start my own bitcoin node, you know, no one really knows who i am
it's not like i'm f2 pool or or a large entity or anything like that
so hypothetically, the larger this unknown category gets, it means the the higher proportion of smaller miners are taking up a larger percent of the network, which is absolutely great
and subsequently, looking at the hash rate distribution and looking at the hash rate distribution over time, you'll notice a trend that the network is becoming more and more decentralized, which is great
another bullish metric for the onchain metrics over on bitcoin is the network difficulty
now when the hash rate is increasing, there are more miners, or miners are using more sophisticated equipment to compete to mine a specific subset of blocks, or their mining block over block over block, and that's what they're competing for
when there are more miners, which is emphasized in the total hash rate, the network difficulty increases
now bitcoin has a mechanism uh called the network difficulty adjustment
now, every now and then it adjusts the difficulty of bitcoin mining
for example, if there are a massive, massive drop in the bitcoin miners like here
what happens is the bitcoin network makes it less difficult to mine blocks, so subsequently, you don't have to spend as much money, or money on mining equipment, to mine the same one bitcoin block
and when the network difficulty increases, it simply means it costs more money to mine one block
and subsequently, when it costs more money to mine a block, and when it costs more money to subsequently earn that reward from that bitcoin block, then the price will normally follow
because miners are not willing to sell their bitcoin that they've got from validating transactions for a lower price when they're paying a larger amount of money to mine that same bitcoin
now with the fees per transaction, you'll notice that this predominantly follows the bitcoin price
the higher, the higher the bitcoin network is congested, then the more it will cost to send a fee
so for example, you can see at the top of the ball run, everyone was sending their crypto to coinbase
and subsequently there was a lot more fees going on in the network
and what you'll notice is, within every market cycle, so you know, the lows from down after the 2015, or the lows before the 2015 bear market, are all the way down here at 10 cent
subsequently, after 2015, or, i mean, we can find low lows down here
and then you come over to after 2015, the lowest we can find it is at six cents
so we've got a higher, we've got a higher, higher, low over on the fees per transaction
come over to december 2018, you'll be hardpressed to find anything below 15, uh, 15 to 17 per transaction
come over into 2020, what you'll notice is 30 cent seems to be the bottom
and currently, looking at where we're sitting at this moment in time, we are capitulating down back to the lows
and in april 2022, the minimum cost per transaction was one dollar
so when you notice the fees per transaction starting to move up, this should be a bullish implication
they should have bullish implications, rather over on the bitcoin price
while this is moving to the downside, it probably means less people are using the network, less people buying, etc
and also, the fees per transaction perfectly correlates with the active addresses
if you're a seasoned veteran to my channel, you'll probably already know that this looks like the bitcoin active addresses
because when the active addresses spike subsequently, it normally means people are sending their crypto over to exchanges and they want to liquidate
if i quickly show you the um active addresses, actually, let's see the unique bitcoin active addresses that are either a sender or receiver
and what you'll notice is this price chart here literally correlates to, you know, the 2017 top
and subsequently, as the price spikes on, or rather, as the active addresses spike, this is normally when the bitcoin price tops out
and this is exactly what we see with the fees per transaction
so, confirmed transactions per day and confirmed payments per day
this would be a payment to, you know, someone else's bitcoin address
where whereas the confirmed transactions could simply mean that you're transferring over to a different wallet that is a subset of your main bitcoin address
or you could just be sending it to, you know, one of your other addresses
so, for example, coinbase to ledger, ledger to coinbase, and it will recognize what that is
now, once again, this is another metric to quantify the value of the network
why is this? well, the more people that are sending transactions, the more people that are sending payments on the bitcoin network
if there was only 10 people that held bitcoin and they used it as a payment to each other, the network would be worthless
however, when the network has a high volume of users, when there's tons of users using the bitcoin network and there's more people making transactions, when there's more people in el salvador using the bitcoin network to, you know, pay for groceries, pay for rent, all of that good stuff using the lightning network, then the payments go up, the transactions go up, the use case of bitcoins goes up
and obviously, more people are using the network, which boosts adoption, which in turn increases the value of the network
we are having a massive, massive runup over time on the on the confirmed transactions and the payments per day
now, within the unique addresses, this is another metric to value the network
now, just like the, uh, the confirm payments per day and confirm transactions per day, you can imagine the more unique addresses used
so for example, if you have, uh, one ledger, and you've got a plethora of addresses in there, which are, you know, a subset of, you know, one, one major address
so for example, if you've got a ledger and you have a 24 word seed phrase, and you will have one main wallet, and you will be able to have a ton of subsets of unique addresses beneath that
but the unique active addresses, they're much, uh, they're much more of a higher metric to quantify the value of the network
so for example, if i have my own wallet, you have your own wallet, your nan has your own wallet
the value of the network goes up because there's more unique people, more unique entities, more individuals using the network
so as you can imagine, as the unique addresses go up, the more people are using the network, which is very, very bullish
and what you'll notice is, even though, even though the price is going down in the past year, in the past three years, the unique active addresses are going up and up and up, meaning that there are more people adopting bitcoin, even though the price is going down
so i hope you found some value in today's episode, tick tock, next block, where we looked at the onchain metrics
we talked about how it's becoming harder to subsequently minor block, how it's becoming more costly to validate transactions
and subsequently, when the hash rate goes up, the price normally follows
we talked about how the hash rate distribution, over time, is going down, meaning the network is becoming more decentralized
we talked about the network difficulty increasing, and as such, it costs more to mine the same bitcoin, and the price should soon follow, unless miners are selling for a loss
once you start seeing the fees per transaction move up, it should mean that more people are sending transactions, buying bitcoins, sending it to their ledgers, sending it to their friends
value of the network goes up, more people are using it, the price should soon follow
we looked at the confirmed transactions per day, confirmed payments and unique active addresses, which are all metrics of the value of the network
so one thing i would like to wrap up the video one, and it's a point that i made at the start of the, uh of the video, but i really want to hammer it in
the price does has absolutely nothing to do with the value of the network
i see a lot of people, uh, intertwine the words value and price
the value of bitcoin has gone down today by 10 or, you know, today specifically, people are saying, the value of bitcoin has gone down 10
the value of the bitcoin network comes from its decentralization and the amount of people using the network
the price of bitcoin is simply the function of its supply and demand
so i just want to double check that the audio is okay, and then we can resume
but, um, i mean, the big issue before was the fact that this was on google meetings, and we were having some issues with spammers
but now it's on youtube, so i think this is a little bit better
so hopefully you guys are doing okay, especially after this recent dump that occurred in the entire crypto market
uh, what's up big john? we got chris p in here, frederick alex
so this will help with the spammers to hopefully minimize the annoying interference
um, but anyways, so you guys are here for some crypto analysis, so let's take a look at the entire crypto market
we're gonna take a look at bitcoin, all right? so taking a look at coin gecko, of course, we can see just how far a lot of these all coins and bitcoin um have pretty much dropped down in the past 24 hours, right? so bitcoin, for example, in the past day, is down over 15 percent
in the past week is about 20 percent, right? ethereum down 18 past week, 30
ethereum took a pretty big hit after there came some delays to its, uh, transition, where it's gonna transition from a proof of stake consensus, or, sorry, from a proof of work to a proofofstake consensus, right? so you need to filter out all the bugs, make sure everything is okay, and then you can, you know, fully implement e 20
and then just about everything else especially, especially all coins would have taken a pretty hefty hit
okay, so i'm not sure if any of you guys are in any trades on bitcoin, but this is currently what we're dealing with on the daily market structure
they're the best, especially when they burst, because then not everyone sticks around
every single cycle slowly kills off some some traders, those that just got in for the shortterm gains, or those that simply bet the house on everything during uh any euphoric stages or periods of hype, and then ended up experiencing a loss
that's unfortunate, but that's the reality of the markets, guys
the markets are, you know, everything is based off of a zero, zero sum gain
so for every winner, there's going to be a loser, okay? and for the most part, institutions are the ones that are the winners, since they can control the majority of, uh, you know, the the order flow in the markets and the price and delivery
so question, where is the next support? so if we take a look at how we recently broke out of this daily range, we can see that we are quite over extended
but one thing that does stand out to me, and i took a look at this a bit earlier, but if we zoom out on the daily and you know what, let's, let's actually go on the four hour let's start off there, and let's mark out the nearest range, right? so the price action, for the most part, has been forming your typical lower lows, lower highs
but now we are starting to consolidate, right? so not as much progress is being made
the bullish momentum recently kicked back in, but it's not yet confirmed that the market structure has fully bottomed out, right? so you don't want to get in trying to catch a falling knife, ideally, unless you're a bit more aggressive as a trader, ideally you want to wait for the market structure to change
you have many, many institutions that are all betting against each other
and for the most part, majority of institutions do win, and the majority of retail traders lose
if you can see these patterns and these liquidations and sort of think how the majority of institutions think, then for the most part, you at least have a better probable etch
but anyways, going back to bitcoin, right? so this is our most recent range that we have been trading in
so let me just mark this out, right? so we bottomed out at 226 000, roughly
okay? and on the 15 minute, this can give us a bit more clarity, right? so this region around 24 000 is where we have been pivoting around
so this upper portion of the range can act as, or has acted as resistance
and the bottom portion, although we have less data, this is where we bottomed out
now, the reason why i bring this up is because if we look at the daily and scroll to the left, and we cut through these lows that we obviously spiked through, uh, during the middle of 2021
if we go further to the left, then this is our last period um about a year and a half ago
okay, so this was december of 2020, where we consolidated for a couple of days before we broke and pushed into the upside, right? so this area, you could look at this as a large region of demand
and so as of right now, this is the region where we're sort of starting to halt in
okay, does this mean that we have formed the lowest low for the ear? i'm going to be discussing that a bit more in just a bit, but there's a good chance we haven't
however, what that does mean is that, at least for the next couple of hours, right? if we, whoa, i did not mean to do that, for the next couple of hours, if we start to range, and we have a sign that the bullish momentum is picking up again, and we break above these highs here to the left, and notice that these highs are within a very tight price range, right? so they're similarly, similarly priced highs
so we could push above this region and at least go for a short term correction
because we are still pretty over extended on the daily so we have less data on the daily
but on the four hour this is what it looks like, right? so we have all these bearish candles
we're approaching pretty much, um, we're already way past the london session
we're approaching the end of the new york session, at least in a few hours, and that's where this current daily candle is about to close, right? so we still have a couple of hours left, but typically around this time during the day, you have less volume in the uh, in the in the markets in general, right? so this is when most traders are offline
so i would expect us to encounter, if not a correction, then at least a period of consolidation
so you could look at this region as a daily region of support
so expecting a bounce back is wrong? oh, okay, i get your question
so your question, expecting a bounce back? is it wrong at these levels? i don't think so
but it is definitely, you guys have to understand that there's a ton of volume being currently traded, so everyone is a sort of in a period of panic
you know, it's sort of like an ongoing cycle where one person sells
why did their neighbors sell well, because everyone on the news media is telling them to sell
and this is typically why, if you go on social media, whether it's youtube, instagram, twitter, whatever, you're gonna see everyone talking about the market crashing
okay? and so that sort of leads towards anyone who sort of got in for any shortterm profits, who may not have had the greatest money management, they're gonna look to exit fairly quickly, um
and it's also going to scare off most people from looking to buy
so it's going to take some time before this fully bottoms out and potentially reverses
now, reverse, when i, when i refer to reversing again, i'm only referring to the hourly market structure
so, because we did have this liquidity grab during the end of may, retest, failure to break above this region of resistance
so we retested, rejected this area again, and then broke out of this range, and then had these strong daily closes, uh, below this range and below these lows
the overall momentum still remains relatively, uh, bearish for at least right now
so although everyone does want to call the top or call the bottom, it is not that simple to do every single time
so it's at least better to wait for some type of confirmation before everything starts to gradually turn around again
so let's see, do i think ethereum will crash? i mean, it is crashing right now
if i could load this up, it is crashing right now, and we are starting to bottom out around this level
so basically, um, this was from the last member stream that i did a few days ago, but i basically did the same thing where i marked out the most recent, uh, price range that we're sort of fluctuating in
so maybe this isn't fine tuned to the exact price, i could actually bring this down just a little bit
but more or less, i was looking at the 1200 level as a major pivot point
so if you look at this and then you scroll to the left, then once more looking, uh, towards uh, january of 2021
we can see this region is where we, for the most part, fluctuated in between
so we had this period of where we were fluctuating, accumulating, and then we had a strong rally
we retested these prices to fill any imbalances left behind here, and of course, to place more orders at a discount
so let's see 21 so alex says 21 000 is very likely, since we got a major weekly imbalance there in december of 2020, and the price won't miss the chance to hit it when it's so close
another question, when should we buy ethereum? so this question, again, it ties into trying to call the top, trying to call the bottom
it really depends on the type of trade setup that you're looking to take
right? if you're a shortterm trader, then you could take a look at this range that we're sort of fluctuating in, right? so this period of accumulation, if we get a strong breakout, which might not necessarily occur right now, right? so the price can continue pushing a bit lower, or can continue consolidating once we get a break and a change of the entire market structure, right? so basically where we transition from having this hourly bearish trend into a range back into having a bullish hourly trend, then you can look to go long
so, similar to bitcoin, if we have a correction that lasts, let's say, a day or so, especially due to the fact that we are super overextended and we've sold off so much, then this is the type of setup that you could look for
otherwise, if you're asking from a longterm perspective, right? where should we buy? maybe as investors or longterm holders? well, this is where the safest answer, to be honest, is simply looking to dollar cost average your weight as the price action continually breaks the market structure and pushes lower
so now someone might ask, okay, well, at which prices should i look to dollar cost averaging? the first one would be, obviously, this major demand level here to the left, on the daily that we are fluctuating in
this is just my stance as to how i approach dollar cost averaging, or at least a variation of it
so technically, dollar cost averaging involves the, you know, the whole promise of time
you basically buy the same amount every week, every two weeks, every month
but in this case, if you're just looking at the price, right, buying the continual dips, this is one level that you could look for, where in the past, this was the high back in 2018
this is going to be spaced out a little bit, right? so you don't just want to buy here and then enter a partial position 100 lower
you should look and sort of space this out, look at the next range
and so what stands out to me immediately is this major imbalance that really that lies between, if i scroll to the left and mark this out, we have a price and balance that was formed during uh january of 2021
i could narrow this down in just a second, but more or less, this region, that's going to be at around 800
this is your next major level of where we would have an imbalance for ethereum, right? so in a price imbalance, that can potentially get targeted
so if i want to narrow this down a bit further, maybe let's go on the four hour scroll to the left
this is where i can also include the volume profile if if i choose to
but in this case, i could just visually see this, right? look at all this low transaction volume that occurred over here
so in this case for ethereum, let me get rid of this indicator
so that, for me, would be the next level for ethereum, right? so notice how now if we take a look at the weekly market structure, this is roughly spaced out, i believe, every 400 to maybe 450 or so
these are the lows that we had during the middle of 2021, right? so this area acted as major support
however, i have these dollar signs as a region that would be targeted for liquidations, which is what happened, uh, very recently
if i extend this by about thirty percent, this marks the next one
and then if we extend this roughly by another thirty percent, this would mark the next one
so i'm looking at eight hundred and fifty dollars potentially as the next, uh, period that we can fall into
so, uh, let's see, uh, what's my longterm view? probably four to five years from now
well, four to five years from now, i'm still very bullish guys, right? so just because you have a bias that is bearish, that doesn't mean that you can't have a larger bias that's bullish
so the markets are fractal, where you can have a trend that's inside of another trend that's inside of another trend, right? so for instance, um, even if we take a look at the last bull run that we had, right? so from many would refer to basically the bottom of 2020
some look at the lowest low that we tapped into, which was around 80 dollars, so in december of 2018
however, you look at this, right? if we look at this last bull run that we had, even though we can all agree, just taking a look at the price action, that this is bullish, right? so we were continually breaking the market structure into the upside
we can all agree that our biased longterm y was, longterm wise, was bullish
this doesn't mean that on a lower time frame it can't be bearish, right? so if i scroll all the way back, look at the last bull run, just because we were bullish, that didn't mean that we didn't have a couple of days where the market corrected twenty percent
uh, that's more in line of, what is this about? 15? so this is actually a range
then we get into september, so q3 2020, this dropped about 35
so just a year and a half ago, 30 percent, right? so everything on a lower time frame
if we think about this, so these days that we were bearish, on a lower time frame, this would mark out shortterm bearish trends, right? so this this as well and everything that i laid out earlier, right? so this is why you can still have a bias
but shortterm wise, you can tell yourself, okay, at least for the next couple weeks, potentially the next couple of months, i'm bearish, so i'm going to be risk off
but then, as the price pushes down into lower levels, i'm going to gradually dollar cost average, how much you um allocate towards ethereum as opposed to bitcoin versus other all coins
but that can be a strategy, right? where for the next couple of weeks or months, you can be bearish, so you can maybe take short term cell setups or dollar cost average
and then when the next, you know, phase picks up again, could be a year, two, three years from now, then you can flip your stance towards being more bullish
and at that point, if you had gradually dollar cost average your weight into ethereum or bitcoin or whatever, then you would have bought at discounted prices
so then you can afford to hold on um and reap those great rewards, right? so that's how you get those 100x or 10x rewards, depending on exactly what you're trading
what does it mean when we say crashing? so crashing just refers to the market dropping, right? so you have these severe, impulsive moves, these severe drops in the market structure
i guess a quick way of looking at this is just go on the daily chart or the weekly, weekly chart, look at the last candle and tell me if it's a large red candle or a large bearish candle
in this case, since it's a large bearish candle, that's our clue
so do i think there's going to be a rally, a relief rally? well, as i discussed right since the momentum is starting to slow down around this region, where in the past we were consolidating and briefly acted as resistance
you have to be cautious when, you when it comes to trying to call bottoms, especially since we're, you know, approaching the afternoon, eastern standard time
i do think it would make sense to rally at least a little bit, since everyone is selling, in order to, you know, gather up more liquidity and then potentially continue pushing lower
so even on the hourly, right? if we take a look to the left, let's actually do the 15 minute and zoom out a little bit, the first thing that stands out to me is this major imbalance that is priced at around 14, what is this? 1410
okay, so this region is your most recent imbalance on the 50 minute slash hourly market structure
and so this is a level that could potentially get targeted, targeted once we do break out of this range
so the reason i say we first need to break out of this range is because what could happen is, right now looks as though we're rallying, and that could be the case, since we actually just recently spiked below these recent lows
so we got the spike, liquidity, grab, increase in bullish momentum, we temporarily broke the market structure
okay? we dropped down, we tapped into, uh, we spiked below this low
we need the confirmation that we have successfully broken out of this market structure
so we need um, in this case, for the price action to break and close outside of this range
i'm actually going to narrow this down just a little bit further, so right around here, right so, because what could happen is we could spike up, and then the momentum can die down for the next couple of hours, then we could be targeting this low
so basically you would have a return back to the bottom of this range, and then we can have a rally after that, or potentially lower lows
so dynamically speaking, on the 50 minute, the 50 is currently lining up with this region of resistance
okay, so we've been making, so alex says we've been making lower highs since november of last year
personally, wouldn't look for longterm buys until we make a higher high on the daily time frame and hold above
so going back to the point that i actually discussed just a few minutes ago, if we recall, let's take a look at the daily market structure
if you guys recall when i took a look at the bull run that we had during 2020 and 2021, let's recall that we had these periods of where for a couple of days the market corrected 10 or 20 percent
but that didn't change the dynamics of the longterm trend, right? so the monthly trend was still pretty bullish, whereas the shorter trend on the shorter time frame, so for a couple of days, was bearish
and so the same thing would apply here, where we are bearish, but we still have, we still could have a period of where for a day or two or a couple of days, we have a 10, maybe 15 20 correction, right? so something like this can occur
but but does that completely flip around the market? well, no, we don't have that confirmation
the market can simply correct a bit, could correct, uh, let's say 15 20 percent
so the one here in the black box can fill with that, tap into obvious, uh, obviously, tap into supply zones
and then we can have a continuation down, right? so you can have that 15 20 relief, bullish relief, but that doesn't change the full dynamics of the market structure
and and i definitely think we're, we're due for some type of bullish correction, especially on ethereum, just taking a look at the last couple of weeks, just from a probable standpoint, this is the most amount of bearish weeks that we've ever had
okay, so it makes sense to at least pull back a little bit, um, at least near the opening of this week, so near 1450 or the 1500 mark
and then after that, we can see how the market structure is respected
then, before we discuss if this is going to continue pushing down again, right? so even taking a look at this channel, right? so this is on the logarithmic chart
but we broke out of this channel, and now we can potentially retrace back into this channel
so the fact that dynamically i can see, whoops, didn't mean to do that
so dynamically, the fact that i can see that the price action is so far overextended past this 13 ema, just tells me that we're going to regress back into the mean, right? so obviously there is more pressure from the bearish side, but you're going to have that real relief that lasts a couple of days, because you do have traders that buy in, and then you also have traders, those that sold here here or here or here
they're going to be looking to take some profits along the way, which is going to have at least a shortterm relief um when it comes to the overall price action
so now let's actually take a look at, let's go back to bitcoin again
there's, you know, obviously it's priced a bit differently, and the market structure is just a little bit different
but for the most part, there's going to be a lot of correlation, right? because these two btc, ethereum, they obviously make up the, you know, the majority of the crypto market cap, okay? and these are the ones that did survive the last bearish cycle
so at least from a historic standpoint, obviously, history doesn't always rhyme to an exact t it's not going to completely repeat itself
okay? so we could have a continuation of um, this, this bearish trend that lasts for a couple of weeks or a couple of months, but then you can have a period of where we start the next bull run once again
so is solana gonna survive? solana tying into um, you know, other altcoins, or any layer one altcoins, i believe there is a good chance it could survive
but as of right now, it's, it's obviously taking a big hit, right? so taking a look at this price compared to the alltime high, remember, ethereum was only down about 75 percent
you guys can such as solana, you could take a look at the last bearish cycle, all the all coins that even survived the last bearish cycle, they got killed, right? they dropped 85, 90, 95 percent
so just just have some caution with um, your alt coins, um, because all coins will take the greatest hit
because most people that flock towards all coins, not not everyone, but most people, are speculators, right? so everyone likes the high risk, right? so the high risk, high reward potential when it comes to altcoins
and so these are very favorable, especially when there's a lot of hype in the market
so if we take a look at the bull run that we experienced a couple of months ago, i guess we can agree that in the beginning, maybe there wasn't a ton of hype
but then once this started to go mainstream, right? so once everyone started to talk about solana and other top altcoins, then you had more hype in the markets
and i remember when it was above 200, and how everyone was saying that, you know, 500 is the next target, then it's a thousand, then it's 2 000
it's at that point where you should at least take some partial profits, or at least, uh, you should have, you should hesitate a little bit if you're looking to buy in, uh
now, that does happen to all all coins, so it's not just solana by itself
but understand that the harder you push in in the upwards direction, the harder you're going to fall down down and it and works, uh, vice versa
but that's if, from a fundamental standpoint, this continues um improving, right? leading into the next bull run
so going on to coin gecko, again, majority of these all coins will die off
like i said, right? speculators flock towards all coins in order to get those quick rewards
then when you have a bear run, and everyone's examining their portfolios, and they notice that, okay, why am i holding on to this one? it's not really, you know, it doesn't have strong fundamental incentives to hold on to it, then they're going to look to sell
and then when that sells, and then the developers, or those that are part of the development team, starts selling as well, or they lose interest in working on the project, then it goes down
so fundamentals are very important in order to fuel up the next bull run
so, you know, you don't need as strong of a fundamental incentive if there's a lot of hype
so honestly, just anything right? so any trend or any hype that that would have hyped any of these all coins up during a bull run was enough to push it towards higher highs
but but then after that, like i said, during bearish cycles, fundamentals start to kick in, and they're much more important, because then everyone who just got in as a speculator is starting to sell off
so my emas i discussed this a minute ago, but just a reminder, this is the 13 this is the 50 ema
they're just there more as a visual aid, so they line up with the market structure
typically you could use them dynamically, but otherwise, i don't really focus on them too much
and even right now, just taking a look at the weekly i could see how this 13 ema is starting to line up with the last range that we broke out of when it comes to bitcoin
and of course, we are pretty overextended, and we're approaching this weekly zone in the past
so this tells me, at least from a probable standpoint, maybe not immediately
so you shouldn't look at this as, oh, we're gonna bottom out right now
you need to give it some time, and then once this gradually turns around, then we can look for a period of where we have a bullish relief
okay? so even right now, we don't have that confirmation just yet
so we did break above this high to the left, temporarily, the market structure is broken
we sweeped this low, but there's still a good chance that we could push lower and then rally after that
so you don't just want to look at it as, look, we have higher highs, higher lows
you need to, you know, be a bit cautious when it comes to stuff like this, especially because we are starting to form, you could argue we're starting to form an inverted head and shoulders
and although that may be true, the right shoulder hasn't finished forming
so even though patterns are not, you know, you shouldn't start by just looking at patterns there
we still don't have that confirmation that this right shoulder has finished forming, right? so we can
so once we do finally break above this neckline, which basically would represent this region of resistance, then we could look to to go long for for bitcoin
and i'm sure you guys might have noticed this, where something might look like a head and shoulders, or an inverted head and shoulders, you don't have that confirmation, and then instead of being a head and shoulders, it simply turns into maybe a double bottom, or you simply have a lower high, a lower low, and the price action continues dropping, right? so this is very messy, but it's, it's basically why i like to look for confirmations, of course
so what does it mean to grab liquidity and who benefits from it
so liquidity basically represents orders in the markets, right? so if you're an institution, it doesn't matter if you're large or small institutions, for the most part, you you're trading with a ton of money
and you could also look at whales as potentially representing institutions as well, right? they not every single whale is an institution, but many institutions are most likely whales
if you're placing a ton of orders, you need the opposite end of your order, right? so if you're a buyer, you need a seller
if you're a seller, you need a buyer in order to go through with your transaction
and so if you're trading with a ton of money, then you need that, again, you need someone else in order to fill in your orders, right? so if you have an institution that's continually, uh, trying to, let's say, buy up bitcoin, well, the only way they could buy up is to get people to sell
so for instance, if we think about this, if i replay this, okay, let's imagine that we have traders that looked to buy over here
right? the majority of retail traders, or smaller institutions, it doesn't just pertain to retail traders, but for the most part, they are on the majority of retail traders will be in the wrong direction
but let's imagine someone is, whoops, didn't mean to use that
they're most likely going to place their stoploss right below these lows
why is that? well, because they see, they're probably on the oneminute chart
so you can refer to this as similarly price lows equal lows, whatever terminology you want to look uh, refer to this as right? so they look at this as, oh, you know, we have this double bottom, even though this technically didn't fully break and reject this range, they're going to look to buy
and then when the price action pushes lower, right? keep in mind, their stoploss is right below here, or maybe a bit lower
there's stop loss, right? since they're in a buy position, the only way that you could exit the market is well through your stop loss
okay? and if you're selling because you bought something, if you're selling it back to the market, you're gonna sell that to another buyer
so you're selling that to another trader or an institution, right? and so this happens over, you know, millions and millions of orders
bitcoin is very liquid, so this plays out, you know, over thousands and millions of of orders, basically at every second, any given second throughout the day, right? and so that is what sort of fuels the liquidity, which is why typically you might even have liquidity graphs, right? so going back, let me take a look at a good example of a liquidity ground
take a look at this one, the one that's marked out from may 31st
let me actually narrow this down to four hour okay, so may 31st, this would represent a good example of a liquidity graph
now, you might think, okay, well, how is this a liquidity grab if we don't have a wick? if this basically looks like a period of consolidation? and what you have to understand is that, even though this is a period of consolidation, on a higher time frame, this is going to look like a wick
okay? and where did we wick? well, let's go back to the four hour we wicked right above this high to the left
so before we use an example of how many traders were looking to go long, maybe with their stoploss set above or their stoploss set below, equal lows
in this case, let's imagine a similar scenario, right? where you have traders that want to go long, except now you have two sides of the aisle
so it's not just where either buyers are losing or sellers are losing
in this case, think about who back then would have bought over here, right? so you have traders buying as soon as the price action spikes above this high to the left, because this is the most obvious high that would have stuck out
again, their stoploss would be set not that far off from here
and additionally, you have the flip side, right? you have traders that are looking to sell, okay? and they probably have a tight stoploss set as well, right? because most people aren't thinking that way
i know a lot of traders are thinking that way as well, those that are beginners
so it's not just bitcoin, but it's across all markets, right? so now, if i play this forward, we can see how we have that liquidity grab period of consolidation, right? so you could look at this as a distribution phase, where any traders that bought down here, so any institution that bought here, they'd be looking to take some profits, and they're also looking to add sell orders, right? because we had this liquidity grab
and how do i know that this is a strong liquidity grab? well, obviously, now through hindsight analysis, we know that the market structure did break
so even after we dropped down, we had this quick spike up, but we, for the most part, respected the best prices up here
so we didn't approach these highs all the way around thirty two thousand or thirty two and a half thousand, right? so these would have been the best premium prices to get in as a seller
and so that's typically what happens in the markets, right? so you'll, you will have that liquidity grab, a ton of orders are placed, especially from an institutional standpoint
this doesn't look like an obvious sell to the majority of retail traders
and sure, that could have happened from a probable standpoint, but in this case it didn't
and then after we dropped down, this is the this is the kicker
notice how after we drop down, we started to form these lower lows and lower highs
in a perfect world, we would have just dropped down like this
so even anyone who got in after the liquidity ground, let's see another retail trader, they'd be looking to get in, let's say they got in over here and they're holding on, or they got in over here and they're holding on
so why did this happen? this happened in order to not only fill this imbalance here to the left, right? so you do have an imbalance in between the low of this candle and the high of this candle
and i'm sure if i go down to the 15 minute i can mark this out with the volume profile
we spiked into around 31 and a half thousand, so any major imbalances that were left behind, they would have been filmed, right? so low transactional volume here, low transaction volume here
so we can actually narrow this down to around, honestly, either or just this range in general wouldn't work
okay? so we spiked into that, fill the imbalance, shook out any traders that sold here, were sold down here, and then the price action took off after that, right? so this is, this is basically, it was a pretty lengthy explanation
if not, then, just after this, you can replay the live stream just to sort of understand where i'm getting at
but again, right, looking at the market structure, the top of this range was respected
we had this period of where we shook out any, uh, traders that looked to sell right after this drop
so even if you saw the liquidity grab and you sold, you would have gotten shaken out
and then what do you know? then we had the strong break out of this range
i'm actually curious how many of you are in any bitcoin trades? are you holding on to any shorts? are you in any long positions? if you do have a setup on trading view, it's totally optional
but if you do have a setup, or you want to share the setup, you can go on the top right click on this camera icon, and then where it says, copy link to the chart image, you could copy this and send it in the chat, and hopefully the links are approved
i believe they will work, but hopefully there's, there's no glitch if you try to send them in the chat
uh, where did you enter? did you get in back here? or did you get in a bit lower? yeah, celsius, you can't even withdraw
everyone's looking at celsius as like luna, a mimic of luna per se, where it's crashing as well
and you're saying, uh, you don't know if binance is allowing bitcoin withdrawals yet or not, they were paused too
see, that's the thing that you guys will notice as well, is whenever you have a ton of volatility in the markets, that's when exchanges, right? so your public, centralized exchanges, so binance, ftx, kucoin, coinbase, they're going to slow down the transactional volume
so they're going to pause withdrawals, or they're going to limit how quickly you get filled in on your orders
they're trying to suppress the amount of losses that they can potentially occur
i'm not saying they're selfish, but it's just typically how it is, right? you have a ton of volatility, a ton of volume in the markets, they want to control it
juan says he closed his position this morning solely building a long position six months to target fifty thousand
well, yeah, at least you have a, you have a good, uh, strategy when it comes to that, right? so you you understand that this is a longterm strategy, right? so you're not looking at this as, oh, we're going to recover into new alltime highs within a week, right? you understand that this can happen, um, that this can take a couple of months, which is important, right? so a lot of traders approach these types of crashes as, you know, i'm just gonna buy the dip
let's assume they're a spot trader, not dollar constant averaging, right? let's assume they're continually buying up the dip
why? because they're greedy, or not greedy, but they're impatient, and they're looking to jump in way too soon
if we look at the last bearish cycle that occurred in 2018, notice how long this took, right? this took a couple of months
and even after we had this period of where we had this bullish relief, we had the last drop down
so let's recall what this looks like without all this data, um that we have to the right? right? so at a certain point, this is what the market looks like
and this is something important that we need to remind ourselves, because the next bull run is not going to be obvious
you're going to be looking at the charts and you're going to be questioning whether or not this is going to continue pushing lower, right? so imagine what everyone was thinking when they saw that, okay, the price action has formed this major high
lower high, lower high, and now we have these large weekly bearish candles that just spiked below these lows
because let's push this back a bit further, right? just a couple weeks prior to that, this looked as though the price action was going to reverse, correct a little bit, form that higher low and then continue pushing higher
why did this happen? again? this is where you have your last ditch effort, liquidity crap, where not only do you buy at a discounted price, so they got this at around four thousand dollars, any institution that continually bought up, but this also squeezes out any traders that are either impatient, or those that maybe have their stop losses set below these lows, or those that think that the market is going to continue pushing lower, right? so i just brought this up as a reminder that it's not going to be very obvious when the next bull run starts, and it's going to take some time
so it's going to take some time before the order flow flips around again
you got in at a pretty, pretty good price if you got in at 31 and 700
i believe i also have a small position that i'm still holding on to, so i have scaled out some profits
so you're adding on the way down, but sunning stop losses just in case it reverses, and a profit regardless of what happens
so just an fyi, right? if you are setting your stop losses, just don't set them way too low, right? so this is a mistake some traders make, where maybe they have a trailing stop set so maybe it's a couple of, you know, few hundred dollars away, or a couple of pips away, or ticks away, depending on the market that you're trading
and so they'll have their trailing stop set, but they'll have it set way too close
and so what could happen? so as i discussed, if we have that deeper correction, let's imagine this is your trailing stop
okay, they'll have it, let me narrow this down, right? they'll have their stale trailing stop set down here, where it automatically moves lower
and then what happens? the price action quickly reverses, right? so we have that period of bullish relief where we rally for, let's say a couple of days
they get taken out their position, their original entry gets taken out, and then the market continues dropping lower
so just have some caution when it comes to either having a trailing stop set too close or setting your stop loss right
i'm not telling you that your stoploss, you know, if your entry was up here, your stoploss should be up here, but just keep that in mind, right? so that's typically, um, how you should approach this with a little bit of caution
i entered shorting alts three days ago in bitcoin ethereum, one day at 28k and 27k
so i'm glad that a couple of you guys are, hopefully a lot of you guys are in some some good trades
and if not, then then don't worry, right? you don't want to panic based off of fomo
you don't want to jump in immediately, especially since this is already too obvious, right? so what you always want to do is you always sort of want to take a step back and ask yourself, is the trend too obvious? because typically when it's too obvious, that's when corrections and liquidity grabs occur, right? so this wasn't as obvious a couple of days ago, but now it's starting to become way too obvious, where the average person sees this, it's going to be talked about on the news media
and so of course, if you jump in now, the likelihood that you're going to encounter a drawdown or a loss goes up, right? it's not a 100 percent guarantee
okay, so, uh, question, where can i learn trading? well, you could learn a lot of it just through practice, through youtube
i was actually meaning to just bring this up really quickly, so just just as a quick reminder for those listening, if, of course, you're interested, you can head out to this site, fxstradingcom
or there's a link provided in the description that would take you here
if you're interested in more, uh, live streams like the one you have right now, which i have with members three times a week, so mondays, wednesday, fridays
i've been doing them for a couple of months now, so i've, you know, they're all recorded
so if you like that, and even more, you can read about that here, if you click on join here
but i am putting a lot of work in this, and we do have some members in there that continually help out beginners, right? so that's it
includes live streams, additional guides, exclusive market update videos, set up requests, i try to answer just about every question
but, but anyways, the last thing that i wanted to discuss with bitcoin, it's, let's discuss some potential targets, some longterm targets, if this continue, continues pushing lower
and for those wondering, this is called the long term regression, uh, bitcoin indicator
i'm sure there's another one, but this is the one that i use, right? this shows us just how gradually over time, right? and let me actually delete these, or not delete, let's hide these moving averages for a little bit, right? this shows us how, gradually, over time, through each bullish cycle, how bitcoin goes through these bearish cycles, and how it pretty much regresses from the top of this, uh, linear curve right to the bottom
okay? and so right now we can argue that we have formed the top for this bullish cycle
now, does that mean that we're going to fully bottom out here? well, not quite right? because taking a look to the left, this shows us how, even back during 2020, so that spike that i discussed, where the price action spiked into four thousand dollars, notice how that basically spiked below the bottom of this band
then the one during 2013, again, we spiked from 230 dollars down to around 160
or actually, no, in this case, the 2011 cycle respected this quite well
but the reason why i bring this up is because we are near the bottom of this, okay? and this just shows us an average of how, uh, the the overall trend of bitcoin, longtermwise, has been bullish, but how it's starting to sort of regress and flatten out
because you obviously need more liquidity in the markets and more institutional adoption in order for this to push higher
so anyone that's saying, well, you know, why don't we just push into, you know, 250, what is that? 200? uh? is that 25 million? dollars, if i'm not mistaken, right? so anyone that says, okay, why can't bitcoin just suddenly push into the millions? well, you need the liquidity in order to drive that up, right? you don't just push immediately
okay, so this is also why the market cap has gradually gone down for the crypto market as well
so i believe the crypto market, if i quickly bring it up, ignore all of these drawings, that's not relevant
but even now, we can see the crypto market cap is below 1 trillion
okay, so now going back to btc, this shows us how we are near the bottom of this band
so we have finally retested the prices that we had back during uh 2017 from the last cycle
so this is the next region where i believe a good level of support uh could represent, uh could be shown on bitcoin
that doesn't mean that this will be necessarily a bottom to a 100 extent, but that we could drop down and approach uh basically the this region that acted as resistance back in 2017
and this, this also would line up with this imbalance to the left, right? so this imbalance from december of 2020 that hasn't been filled or mitigated yet, and that's what we're currently approaching
and so this isn't a single price, but it's roughly at around you could look at 21 000, or slightly below that
it might not happen immediately, right? so we could have a period of a bullish relief that lasts maybe a few days
but then after that, i think we're much more likely to push down
so this price balance, uh, this price imbalance, even though you could see it on the current chart, depending on the broker that you use, or maybe you're looking at the futures market, this will will look like a gap
so so yeah, around 19 000 up to around 21 000 would be my next target
so i'm just going to call it 20 000, more or less, i'm just going to round it to that round psychological number
i definitely don't think that it's very unlikely that we push into those prices, that we don't push there, right? i think there's a good chance that we do
so, question, in order to find the bottom, we need to, we need complete desperation
and in every single bear market, the bottom was marked by an amount of longs hitting the 200 ema bitcoin
so so, yeah, you you will have some similarities where, well, where you might have accumulation from whales, or you push into a major demand zone, or you reach a period of where simply you have the demand outweighing the supply, where the majority of the retail crowd is out of the market
so you have different coin signing factors that don't just tie into technical analysis, but also might tie into something like onchain analysis
so, yeah, i i do agree that, uh, you you could look at those catalysts as well
uh, the 200 ema would just be, um, it's just one clue as to what exactly is occurring
so don't just look at emas as the holy grail system that's going to call the bottom
because, as we can see looking to the left, it has spiked below the 200 ema before
so it might be a good confluence to have, but i would look at emas as being a secondary tool compared to the overall price action and the overall market structure
so, yeah, the amount of longs is definitely rising, uh, which could either mark either the bottom of this cycle, again, we never know for an exact certainty, or it can represent a shortterm period of relief, where we rally, maybe for a couple of days, and then continue pushing lower, which is why dollar cost averaging is potentially the best, uh, proven strategy, where you're not necessarily looking to call the bottom as a longterm investor, but you're gradually buying it up as the market pushes lower and lower
so question for the bull market, we need a liquidation of these mass longs? um, well, well, yeah, a lot of these
so i i can take a look on that, at that chart in a little bit
but again, everything comes with some type of regressions, uh, some mean regressions
so for instance, um, here we can see how the bitcoin longs started to pick up in january and february
and then in march and early april, it slowed down a bit before it started to pick up again, right? so so here we can see, right? so it started to pick up, then it slowed down a bit in march april, and then it continually picked up again
so just because, you know, we are at alltime highs with bitcoin logs
and also, it could fluctuate, right? so as i discussed, we could have a period of relief and then a continuation pushing lower
and as i discussed, 20 000 maybe wouldn't be my only target, right? so even beyond the 20 dollar mark, if we just look at around psychological level, we could look at fifteen thousand
and what do you know? at around fifteen thousand, let me look at the daily scroll to the left
we can see this is another region of where, i wouldn't say there's maybe a huge price and balance here, maybe inside of this wick from november of 2020
so we consolidated, we broke out of here, and we continue rallying, rallying, right? so we didn't retest this level just yet
so i think 14 and a half or 15 000 isn't completely out of the picture as well, right? so that would be maybe a last ditch um attempt of where you would, you would reach total despair in the markets
okay, so if we think about, you know, the fact that we had a ton of hype back in 2012, right? so maybe hype was at its peak in november of of last year
so the hype was maybe out of 10, and then it started to go down
so you can think about the inverse, right? instead of hype, you have maximum fear
so i do think that although we are approaching, or we pretty much are in, a an era of capitulation in the market, right? so everyone's selling off, everyone's fearful, i think, breaking below 20k, just because everyone is looking at 20k as the next low, right? a break below 20k, since we haven't, seen, um, a one as the first digit in quite some time, right? so it's been about a year and a half, a drop below 20k, especially down to 15k, would probably induce the most amount of fear
so so, yeah, i i'm just looking at this as a game of probability
obviously, the higher the prices, the more likely it is to, you know, bottom out, right? so for instance, right now, 232 thousand dollars
we know that we pushed into that, so this could potentially be the market low
what's your why you should look to dollar cost average instead of just calling, trying to call the bottom
but but as i discussed, 20 000 is a good target, and it's not completely something that can't happen, right? so even looking at the last cycle, i think i made a video on this on youtube, right? so if you look at the last cycle, if we match the bottom of 2015 to the top of, basically the top of 2017, and then all the way down to where we crashed
and we can see how, basically, we corrected about 35 percent of the weight, right? so we had this bullish, impulsive move
and so currently, if we mark this out from, uh, let me just delete all of this
so if we mark this out from the low of this current cycle, so let's assume you could either match it up with the low of december 18 or march 2020
well, then a 40 correction, what do you know, where does it line up? it lines up around twenty thousand
so that's why twenty thousand, i think, is a very good chance that we push into that and potentially lower
um, i'm obviously, since the markets are dipping down, i'm looking more towards, uh, investing, although i i do both as well, right? so i do invest
yeah, i'm gonna, that reminds me, i'm going to just wrap this up here
if i didn't get a chance to answer it, or answer your questions, then just link it down in either the comment section or in the public community
so maybe the next public stream will have it, maybe a week or two week, two weeks from now
yeah, so sometimes i just just kind of just zone in and just just go ham with these charts, just to analyze it left and right and just who i am
it's, it's, uh, it's just, it's a habit of mine, but it is what it is
uh, again, reminder, guys, if you're interested, uh, check this out on either fxstradingcom, or there's more information provided in the description of my videos here
you have additional trading guidance and live sessions you can join here, read about that as well
so this will include multiple indepth live streams like the one i have here, that i have multiple times per week with members, and and also much more
the current bitcoin price is twenty four thousand and sixty six dollars
and for those of you that have been sitting on cash for a long time, like myself, you may be itching to buy, but i would encourage you to just wait a little bit longer
so let's take straight to the charts and have a look at what is going on so let's zoom out
firstly, i have the uh age old weekly chart over here with the 21 weekly exponential moving average, which is the yellow one
this has kept me out of a lot of trouble over the years of being in bitcoin
for those of you who are new here, and maybe you haven't seen this
essentially, when this is angled upwards and price is above the yellow 21 exponential, good bull market
when a price is stuck below and it's angled down, bad bear market
i outlined this a long, long time ago, and i haven't brought this chart back up
but i said that any time that we enter into this yellow box territory, it is historically, probably decent value for money to be buying at these levels
i'm not telling you to use any leverage or anything like that
but i had a target of around 22 356 dollars, and we just about getting there
so that doesn't mean i'm going to ape in with everything that i've got, but i definitely will start nibbling in in those levels
let's have a look over here at the dixie, which is the dollar index
when it closed above this key horizontal level at 1036761, above that white line, then i said that there would most likely be continuation, which is exactly what we've got
and now i'm telling you, once we take out this next level over here, let's just quickly put that in, grab our magnet to get it exact
once we take out the previous uh, week's week high, which is 105005 on the dixie the dollar index, then i would expect that it's going to be even more bullish
that could be where the whole capitulation comes in for bitcoin
uh? and i know some of you may think this is already capitulation, but i would tell you that it's probably not
capitulation candles would wipe out about 30 to 40 percent more of the altcoins current gains, set or selloff that they have
you'll probably get another 30 to 40 percent down from these current levels
it looks the same on the s p it looks, it looks like that on all of them
so guys, i really encourage you follow me on twitter, because i do warn you of this stuff
and on all of these, pretty much every single one of the short plays that we had, the short setups, have played out
i said the target on ethereum, i mean on on solana, that was on the 6th of june, was 20 to 26
if you follow me on twitter, this is where i'm able to release the information immediately
let's have a look at bitcoin a little bit closer and see what's going on over here
um, essentially we were looking at this main horizontal area that got lost
i said that, well, once we lose that area, we're in a bit of trouble
we're coming off the diagonal trend, trendline resistance over here
i said that i'd be looking for shorts on weak alt queens once we in this zone
and we started to lose those levels, and then we lost again, the key horizontal at 29 307
and i said, how much longer can we stick under that area before price starts to sell off rapidly? and now that's what we're getting
i mean, realistically, this is your next major, uh, liquid zone where there is liquidity lying in the market
and if you really, really want to be aggressive on your buys, then it would probably be in that zone that we're kind of at right now
but you know, when markets move like this, you have to be careful
so if you look at this and you ask yourself, realistically, where is their support? so when a market moves, let me grab my paint brush quickly, where is it over here? when a market moves like this, and it goes virtually straight up, no pauses, nothing there
then what's it going to do when it comes down? when there's distribution in a bear market, you can expect the same thing
maybe you get some sort of a bounce, then you start to again, flip these areas that were previous support into resistance, and then continue back down
and that is the realistic outlook on what may happen in this market
and i couldn't, i couldn't mention all of this, uh, the low targets of 11 to 14k, which is where i think the ultimate bottom will be in because, uh, obviously people are gonna hate me, block me, delete me
but now that we're getting closer to the next level, and this is why i try and instruct everybody at level to level, now we're getting to the next level, i'm going to be a buyer between 21 and 23k
most likely about 50 of my capital will be deployed at those levels in spot positions, specifically
so let's say, if you were to buy from there, and you bounce back up into those zones, that's on bitcoin is going to be 35
everybody will say, well, that's at the bottom's in bull markets
back on, altcoins will rally maybe like four or five x from those current levels, which will be huge
and then when we get back to that key horizontal level at 29 30k level, i'll probably be cautiously again
i'll probably offload some of those profits, and i'll say to myself, well, let's see
if we can clear that level, then we target the next upper level
so that's kind of the way that i'm playing the current market
it's got another like 10 to 15 to get into the next meaningful support, possible bounce from there
so if that's an indicator of the overall market, uh, for altcoins, they they still have some pain to go
i remember when i posted this, everybody said that i'm absolutely crazy
i must be joking, uh? and i said, yeah, there's first target, take your profits
i'm on a high time frame, charity, on a three day but this is just to give you some perspective
so possible bounce from this level, reload it the next area of resistance
i'll put a theorem on to a 12 hour these will be updated in the daily candle newsletter
i remember, i got a lot of hate for this when i put this descending triangle, which has a measured move
so if you have a look in the description below over there, please follow me on twitter
also, if you do want to follow along with the type of trades that i'm taking, one way that you can support me is with my bit link
by the way, i'll probably have to do a video on that for you guys at some point
this, uh, video is probably brought to you by unix gaming, and i'll see you guys tomorrow

what is up my crypto legends? hope everyone is having a great day today, despite bitcoin absolutely collapsing where is the floor going to be? guys? let's find out in this live stream
i actually longed this daily level, okay, and got stopped out
these this is why we do have stop losses, okay, just to get out of the market, just in case this big, massive collapse does continue
we actually lost this level, okay, this daily, major level that i was talking about in today's stream
and we can see right over here, okay, this major consolidation level
we're probably gonna retest very, very soon, the alltime high from the last cycle in 2017
we we know that bitcoin can do that movement in just a matter of a few hours
so, yes, no time, you know, no signs of bottoming out anytime soon
so if we do kind of lose this 23 000 range, okay, where we do have this daily level, we do have this major consolidation back in december of 2020, i do think that we might be holding this range
okay, it's very, very likely in between today and tomorrow we can see, okay, the daily close potentially closing above this range
if we do have this daily close above the 23 800 range, it is probably gonna have a larger relief rally by tomorrow
we'll be analyzing bitcoin, of course, on the two hourly charts, zooming in here to check out these major levels, potential levels, okay, for this relief rally, where we could we get resistance? um, dx y is exploding
the dollar index, okay, we broke this major trend line, this uptrend, and, you know, there was a possibility on actually creating, potentially a double top, a slightly higher high over here
what happens if there's demand on dollars? of course, the dollar value goes up
i was expecting slightly higher, but there was a bat pattern here that played out pretty, pretty nicely
okay, talking about that 4 200 points, 4 250, potentially this zone over here where we're probably going to get that correction on on the s p 500
and, yeah, we're gonna, i want to take a look at some other markets, if you wish
i do think that we are going to go lower on natural gas and oil because i think, you know, natural gas is in a kind of a distribution event
um, so, yeah, let me just go through the comment section right away
dave, guys, 10k btc? possible? says kamali, absolutely possible
i mean, of course i would be, you know, first of all, let's take a look, you know, at some, some major levels
but we were analyzing the situation for bitcoin hitting that 12 000 range
and this was mentioned, you know, about a few weeks ago, that it is very possible with recession, with panic, btc, crypto can collapse very, very heavily, because the movement from this 20 000 range, and even, you know, from lower, because we had a very large consolidation back in 2019, even part of 2018, 2020 here, with that 12 000, major resistance
so if we were to come down to that level, i mean, that would be in my personal opinion, you know, the best buying opportunity that bitcoin can give us, uh, the 12 000 range
okay? i do strongly believe that a lot of people are going to start buying up at this range
end, price of btc will be picking up pretty pretty fast in the next couple months, of course
um, yeah, like i said, you know, the amount of volume, you know, look how fast we went from twenty thousand dollars all the way up here to, uh, above thirty thousand dollars, uh, losing this major level, okay, this major support of 30k, can, you know, can make the price action of bitcoin, uh, have a pretty, pretty sharp correction
and this is what we are seeing, all right, for the last few days on bitcoin
looks, you know, looks like it's imminent that we're going to retest this range currently now, bitcoin is getting a little bit of a relief rally
but, yeah, there is a possibility in us actually closing the daily candle above this major daily level, all right
if we do close the daily candle above this range, i think a bigger relief rally is very, very possible
anyway, let me just say hello here to the community right away
how are you doing? rudolph, excited to rack up some coins during this bear market
dolph rodolfo, absolutely, absolutely totally agree with that
i am accumulating at these levels every single week, bitcoin, ethereum
okay, not 100 in bitcoin and ethereum, of course, having some stable coins, you know, waiting for, i've been saying that the last few couple of weeks, that i'm not accumulating all coins just yet, uh, because i think there's going to be several months of sideways action after the big, major collapse, right? there's going to be a lot of sideways action, just like what happened, you know, back in 2018 and 2019
after the after the floor levels of of consolidation, which would be absolutely phenomenal to accumulate bitcoin, ethereum and some very, very good altcoin projects
but, you know, this is like a falling knife, you know, it has this finished, has this finished
so is this gonna have a massive vshape recovery? uh, no, very unlikely this is gonna happen
so you will have time, you will have time to to accumulate at cheap levels, right? let's take a look
uh, jasek, how are you doing? uh, what's up? my crypto legend says, monk labs, how are you doing? uh, priest of crypto, all in
um looking for that bounce at this major daily level, we were getting a little bit of a consolidation, but then finally dropping back down, got stopped out
but these, this is why stop losses, you know, are very much needed
because i entered right over here, and, um, my stoploss was, you know, exactly at the 23 400, uh
beautiful entry here, you know, at the twenty eight thousand one hundred dollars, shown in today's live stream
i did close, you know, about seventy percent of my trade here at this range, but rode 30 of the trade all the way down here to these 24 000 levels, which was absolutely phenomenal
and this is why, you know, this kind of stop loss is insignificant compared to, you know, uh, big trades
okay? these five to one, these even, you know, eight to one, ten to one trades risk to reward
this is why these small stop losses, you can get stop loss, you know, three, four, five times that, you know, this long, long, big trade, okay, can give, you you know, much, much more gain
so this is why these, the risk management is insanely important
make sure to join the bibet competition that starts on the 27th of, um, this month
okay, 27th of june, and join the telegram for the competition as soon as you sign up
we need to see some type of consolidation, some type of of floor levels
i'm not repeating myself from stuff of last week or two weeks ago
this was yesterday's live stream live talking about that dead cat bounce, talking about that major resistance level, that this was very likely to continue to the downside and have a collapse, because we lost the value area low of the 28 600, okay, from the volume traded the last 30 days
and what happens when you lose a massive, big support level, value area low, that you have been trading for for over a month? then, yeah, when you lose it, the drop can be very, very fast
but if i zoom out on the three daily chart, or the daily chart, you know, back here, where i do have this daily level, it was a consolidation
you can see here, the red horizontal line is the bitcoin price currently at 23 200 approximately
so, yeah, this range could potentially hold for a relief rally in between today and tomorrow
so your question might be, where is there a good shorting opportunity? um, well, the 252k levels, this low area, could be a good level
i would zoom in into the 30 minute chart to take a look, you know, at this major drop over here
so if we, if we were to, if we were to end up this drop here, yeah, round about the six one eight, twenty four point seven could be a major zone
you know, this price action was much better, you know, easier to trade, but this is a little bit, you know, this is collapsing very, very big
okay, some major levels where we could bounce, because it's, it's very hard at this moment to trade this
and, yeah, we don't want to catch falling nice even though i tried to catch one today at this daily level, but got stopped out
btc, consolidation and bounce to 28k soon, says t pereira, uh, to 20 000
um, consolidation and a in a move up to twenty eight thousand dollars
all right, yesterday's, i mean, i could get stopped out, you know, at least about six times, um, to lose the actual trade from yesterday
i mean, this was absolutely insane, you know, to lose that amount of gains that i had, you know, i need to do, i need to get stopped out six times, you know, uh, from the gains of yesterday
so this is why, you know, this is why, you know, you have stop losses, of course
craig, how are you? ksh, how are you doing? naveen, wow, two lives in a day
sister bean, yeah, well, i'm here to, you know, it's exciting times for bitcoin
exciting times with even though we're absolutely collapsing, this is, um, a gift from god
um, can we go lower? there will be a moment dxy is going to peak
when is it going to happen? well, yeah, we don't really exactly know, but, yeah, it's, it's gone pretty parabolic
so, um, yeah, this is very, very likely going to be another lower high in the next coming months at some point
and, yeah, potentially by who knows, you know, what is 2024? 2025 is where we will see, um, you know, the the collapse of the dollar
no one really knows exact science, but it will very likely collapse
and this is when bitcoin and some very good altcoin projects, of course, will thrive
i did say on in the telegram group that i got, um stopped out, not liquidated, not liquidated
it will be looking pretty good if the daily does manage to close above 238, uh, we'll probably be holding this range and having a larger relief rally before continuation to the downside
no signs of stopping, no signs of strength, no signs of stopping anytime soon
is it advisable to enter a short trade only on a relief, only on a relief, only on major resistance? okay, like, um, like yesterday
we were pretty confident in this drop, because we lost the value area low
had a big drop here all the way down to around about the 26 7k levels, had the relief rally to 20, uh, 281
but yesterday, you know, i was talking about, you know, we've lost this value area low
what is fast? you know, fasting crypto can be one, two, three days
you know, three days drop of, you know, over five thousand dollars in in less than than then, uh, then then three days
this was in about 24 hours, in less than 24 hours, dropping from 28k all the way down to, you know, sub 23k
if you are in panic, you spend too much money, or you did not take profit in time
i only took 20, about 20 profit? uh, more or less, i would save 25, because there was some altcoins that i did
but, yeah, of my total investment from 2018, 2019, 2020, i only took 20 profits here
i did a little bit of profit taking in a little bit of altcoin speculation here in september, november, okay, even in december, around these ranges, but not enough, not enough take profits from my initial investment here
you know, huge gains already from the amount of investment that i did
and something important that i did ask the community, you know, most of the people investing in 2021, in 2022, it was about 70 percent of people from my community watching live stream, saying they started investing in crypto all the way here in 2021 and 2022
most of the people right now that are in crypto are in the red because, um, of the huge amount of, you know, people that are invested here, you know, people that i encrypt are right now, that have started investing in 2021, in 2022, which is a huge amount of people
you know, maybe it's only good as about 20 of people that invested in crypto are in profit right now
ones that i've been investing around these, around these levels back in 2018, 2019
uh, guys, the ones that hold on, the ones that hold on for the next few years, the ones that accumulate for the next six eighty months, are going to be the ones that are going to be welloffs, uh, in you know, 2024, 2025, 2026
btc maybe hits 30, uh? 13k, yeah, i do see many people talking about this
you know, we got, you know, if we're gonna follow, you know, textbook technical analysis
you know, this bear flag over here, we got the, you know, the poll and the projected move from this breakdown
you know, this can give us that thirteen thousand dollar range
where was the ultimate low from the bear market back in 2019? it was all the way down here, all the way down here
and if you use elliott wave count, you know, where's the ultimate low from the bear market, december of 20 uh, 2018
if we take this as an impulsive wave, until july of 2019, that took us almost to about 14 000
you have the second wave, giving us the low here in, uh, the c19, uh crash
back in 20 or march of 2020, you have the third, big, impulsive wave
we know that the third wave on elliott wave count is the strongest wave
this could be the fourth wave, of course, this massive, big corrective wave that we did have in the sum of 2021
and then we have the the fifth wave being very, very poor, okay, very, very poor, fifth wave not managing to go much higher than the third wave, and then having this collapse
so you can see that the counts there on these waves, um, you could speculate, you can't, you could speculate that we are in this side of, the inside of the abc correction
and if we take a look at the a correction here, going as low as 33 000
back in january of 2022, we had the b coming all the way up to 48 000
c correction can go as low as the first wave, first impulsive wave
where is the first impulsive wave? well, it is right over here, around about the 13, 14 000
this is why you can say that this c correction will come down to the first impulsive wave of the bear market
and, you know, we can come down to 13 000, which is the high of the first wave, uh, and even slightly lower, you know, and consolidate here for quite some time, for several, several months
so this is, you know, another reason why you could think that we are going to come down to, um, to thirteen thousand dollar late range
so you add up, you add up these these, you know, these things on the bitcoin chart
you've also got the value area high from the massive volume that you have been trading from 2018 till 2020
value area high from this range is exactly here, at this 12 000 area, approximately slightly above
so you have many things pointing out that if the price does come down to this range, it is going to be a, a very, very good buying opportunity
i think this is the the ultimate low levels for bitcoin, the 12 000, 30 000 range
and something very, very curious to see is, if i go to the brave new coin here, to see the entire existence of bitcoin
you know, we never retested the alltime high from each cycle, never
and, you know, this is why people are very, you know, skeptical, that we are probably not going to reach twelve thirteen thousand dollars
and it is very, very possible with the current market, current worldwide situation, dollar being king, cash being king
you can see it in in the c19 event back in 2020, when, uh, the dollar had a big, massive spike, when we see when we did see c19 kicking in back in 2020
so, um, you can see here, on these cycles, the last alltime high was never retested
so okay, i think it is very, very possible that alltime high will be retested with just a few thousand dollars away, and we could actually dip slightly below, because it's gonna be different
let's take a look, just a little bit of an explanation here on my thoughts
um, [Music], do log charts affect harmonic patterns? well, no, not really, because it's level to level
um, you need to check out the fibonacci numbers on the harmonic pattern
where it will btc bounce to? if we get relief rally, where will it bounce to? very good question
if we go to the 30 minute chart, lower time frame, we can see a little bit of a relief rally here going on at this moment
um, [Music], where can we go up to? well, i mean, volume is pretty high here on the bearish action
i think if we do close this daily, uh candle above the daily level from back of 2020, december of 2020, look at this large consolidation
so if we do get that bounce, where can we go up to? we could have a pretty, pretty large relief rally
pretty large relief rally is very, very possible here on on bitcoin
um, i would count this as an entire big drop, all of this being an entire big drop here, looking at the four hourly chart
so, yeah, at least to round about the 253, which is the low area created here, and and even higher
i think a larger relief rally after this major drop is, is very, very possible
let's go to the 30minute chart here analyze the situation on btc
we've been dropping so so far that a large relief rally is, is, is very, very possible, until we actually see some big resistance levels
i mean, the 28 600 range is a huge level, as you can see here, the value area low
but we're just so, so far away from that range at this moment
i'm not saying it's impossible to reach this range, but, uh, yeah
from the top here of this major drop, looking at the four hourly chart
um, yeah, from this drop, you're looking at the four hourly chart
i mean, that would be an insane shorting opportunity if we had an insane relief rally in the next coming days
i'm not sure if we're going to have that big of a relief rally
maybe institutions, smart money is buying right now, no doubt about that
um, but, yeah, relief rally at least, at least, at least to this 25 300, 25 200, where we do have the lows here created from the 12th of may
so if we do come up there, to this level, it's very likely to get rejected
we're having a little bit of a kind of a short squeeze, massive, big relief rally
is the huge volume coming in? yeah, not much volume coming in at this moment
um, we get to 10k, already tired of this up and down? says andre
uh, well, i mean, are we going to reach 10k? that is the question
will we reach 10k? i'm telling you, a lot of, a lot of people will be missing out 5k bitcoin
we do have the drop from here, uh, from early this morning, six o'clock in the morning, right there where we did have this relief pump, and then we had this aggressive drop
the 618 level is exactly at 24 800, where we do have a major low right there
also, i'm not sure if we're going to reach that range in the coming hours, but it might be a good, good shorting level
all coins did well to hold their levels and base out, it seemed
btc dipped lower, and then alt coins did, uh, at the bottom and didn't bottom out as nicely
um, let's take a look here at the bitcoin dominance, because bitcoin dominance is, i bet bitcoin dominance was pumping, or is it correcting? well, i had a pretty sharp correction
as you said here in the comment section, we've had a correction from the 485 all the way to the 47 bitcoin dominance today
so this means that the all coins probably have defended very well some levels
you know, we either makes a double top or retesters this trend line
okay, from this aggressive higher lows and create a kind of a double top, or a slightly higher high, and then correct guys
we could get that massive corrector, um, relief rally for bitcoin if that does happen
you know, if we, if we want to get these, um, lagging indicators on the daily you know it if we do, if we do, actually, we've already created a higher high on the dxy
we are creating lower highs on the rsi, uh, if we start pumping in the next coming days, even higher, expect a major correction, potentially, on the dxy
we'll be retesting this trend line, as you can see from the breakout from the parabolic move of the dxy, higher lows trendline
should i hold or sell all coins? should i wait? andy, i mean, well, if this is definitely not, in my personal opinion, a good selling level
okay? all coins are already 90 percent down, 95 percent down from alltime highs
so, yeah, we're actually getting a rejection from this, from this daily level
it is time for the market to let, let it do what it needs to do
you know, go down sideways, see some consolidations, and then, you know, maybe do some range trading, because we might be creating a range in the next coming days
there's not going to be as much panic, and we might be seeing a lot of good trading opportunities, guys
we'll be seeing some opportunities in the next couple of days
i mean, i mean, this is the thing, if you you shouldn't be putting money that you need on a daily basis
back in 2018 and 2019, i was very aggressive with my investments in crypto
um, no idea where waves is right now, but we were potentially looking for a long position on waves
but we were very, very much, you know, i was very much saying, guys, if bitcoin looks bearish, it's gonna, it's losing the twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, which was a valiary low, and the the four was going to be very, very fast
and it's not a good idea to to to long, uh, all coins, of course, shorting them, yes
but waves, i was looking for a potential bullish reaction here
i was saying, yeah, guys, i'm gonna forget about this long here on on waves because, uh, bitcoin is looking very, very bearish
if anything, if bitcoin comes down to retest the 25 000 levels, it's very likely that waves will be retesting these lows
uh, um, what can we see on waves? i mean, it's at these low levels
it's, it seems like that this range is very, very strong on waves
you know, is it possible for a double bottom? you know, if we do see bitcoin getting exhausted here at this 22, 23 000 and going sideways, yeah, expect a potential double bottom here on waves
we have a massive adam and eve pattern here on waves created in 2018 and, uh, 2019 and 2020, double bottom, adam and eve right there
and we are currently at the resistance, very much respected level, uh, as support
um, i mean, you could potentially short them if bitcoin does look bearish, but bitcoin is there
if bitcoin might be just relief, rallying and going sideways for some time
the big movement, the big selloff, was in between yesterday and today
after losing this value area low last couple of days ago, this was the level to hold
you lose that level, it's time to be aggressively looking for shorts
i think a lot of people did short that range, that 281 um, hi andy
anything about phantom and matic? i don't, i do not even want to take a look at those kryptos
um, if bitcoin comes down, if bitcoin comes down to 12, 13 000 levels
i mean, ethereum can come easily, easily to about three, four hundred dollar levels, where we had the largest consolidation here back in 2019 and 2020
value area high from this trading range is about 400, 300, 400 dollars, between 300 and 500
if that does happen, remember, ethereum is is the pipelines for every, you know, not every single crypto project, but for most of the crypto projects, 70 of the projects are built on the ethereum network, d5, gaming, you you name it, 70 or more are built on ethereum
so what big, major levels are good to buy? you know, the the biggest consolidation area that we've had, uh, below alltime highs, which is at, you know, in between 300 and 500
are we going to go down that low if bitcoin continues going down? yes, of course, i do think so
it is kind of creating a kind of a double bottom here, dipped slightly below this range
uh, we could see a, a a double bottom scenario here on phantom, if we do see a relief rally on bitcoin
biggest levels on phantom, looking at the vpvr, is four, five cents
extreme low levels would be the four five cents on on phantom, if it does go down there
i mean, that is already going to be accumulation levels for the next coming months
you know, talking about, you know, all of these, um, you know, different projects, all coins that i am accumulating during the the bear market
you know, millionaires will be made in the next couple of years in crypto
so, yeah, uh, when is it going to end? says god, the good one
when is it going to end? looks like that we're going to have, you know, six, 18 months, approximately, of big, big, sideways action
the possibility of bitcoin coming down to 12k, 13k, is very, very possible
it's super interesting because, you know, comparing, comparing, comparing, comparing, uh, just one second here
the the, uh, you know, there's crypto savvy, shout out to him
let's get this out of the way, you know, talking about, um, bitcoin even going to 9k levels
but he's, he's been comparing the dotcom bubble, you know, the amazon chart, with bitcoin on the weekly if i think that's correct
let's take a look at the, uh, um, is it amazon here on nasdaq? yeah, we should be having, uh, just give me one second here
i just want to get these two charts together, which is pretty, pretty insane
he was talking about this, um, when we were around about the 50 000, you know, talking about that potential 10k level bitcoin
and if we go with amazon back in in the late 90s, early 2000s, i mean, it's not the exact same thing, but it was a double top, you know, market bubble here from the from the late 90s, okay, the dotcom bubble
and he was calling, you know, if we were to kind of mirror this, this price action on bitcoin and crypto, you know, he was calling for bitcoin going down to 10, 12 k, if we were to make the same impulsive moves, um, but, yeah, then, of course, what happened, what happened here is that amazon found a floor
well, um, yeah, i mean, i, i did take most of the profits at 277
no, no major trading opportunities at this at this moment um, the oldtime high levels can be very much rejected
okay, uh, let's take a look at ethereum on the two hourly chart
i don't think i traded this, but we've got the daily level here
oh yeah, i remember this daily level, the daily level from the lows created on march of 2021
we've got a beautiful bounce from that level, almost to the exact dollar here on ethereum
and, you know, we can take a look at the four hourly chart, the two hourly chart, go with the trend
this is a major zone where to take a fib level from this high, at the one thousand, four hundred, uh, five hundred, forty, 540 to the lows
if we do, in consolidate, it's a major shorting opportunity to just continue the trend to the downside, only if we get a large consolidation
we got some spikes here from the volume trader the last few days
um, one being at the 1350, which would be at 50 fibonacci retracement
so, yeah, 50 fib level, with this spike over here, 1 350 is already going to be strong resistance on ethereum, question is, you might get this kind of abc correction, bouncing in between fib levels
and then here you're gonna get a big, big, big consolidation and a rejection for the next coming days
now, as i've like, already liked andy, absolutely phenomenal, guys
uh, what about solana? well, i don't even want to take a look at solana
did it survive? did it manage to hold pretty nicely? um, last thing, the last few things that we were talking about solana was this aggressive descending triangle
it was a pretty aggressive descending triangle here, creating lower highs
we had a major low level that created a shortterm double bottom, aggressive lower highs
and you know, as soon as we started breaking this low, it was big, massive collapse
i mean, solana, i think it can retest the summer lows of 2021, which is down at 20 uh
this is just very, very likely to happen, very, very likely to happen
you know, it's just getting, it's very likely going to be retested
um, so we would be looking for shorting opportunities on solana
if we do come up solana, and we're not that far off, if we do get a relief rally on bitcoin and start getting exhausted, uh, solana major good level is here at the 35 36, 35 this major low, should be reacting as heavy resistance
i would get it from here, because this is the start of the drop on the four hourly
six one eight level, fifty percent is exactly at the thirty five thousand dollar area
you could be getting that volatility, that reaction at that range
and, you you know, big spike on the vpvr stats starts at this range, at the 35 36 dollars
if we do see solana getting that really rally, uh, it's gonna be a good shorting opportunity, i think, that 35 36, if it does pump all the way up there, uh, because i think the 20 22 range is almost imminent to be retested
i mean, the the the expansion the ex fib level, the 1618 very good target for, uh, for a consolidation breakout
okay, from this double bottom, the 1618 golden ratio here is is the expansion of this potential breakout
so if you do get that relief rally on on on enchilada to round about the 35 dollars, i think it's going to be a very, very good level for for shorting
you got an insane bonus to be claimed, up to seven percent added to your deposit
also, by bit you do get up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus
make a fee, you do not pay any make a fee for 30 days, and you get up to 4050
check out bitcoin census website guys, for the latest news and technical analysis articles
you can check out this article right now on the bitcoin center's website
you know what i think i would say, you know, let the price action do what it needs to do
we might be just holding this range, closing this daily level above the large consolidation that we did have in december of 2020
and we're gonna maybe see a bigger relief rally on on bitcoin, or maybe sideways action
we'll be looking for some big, major opportunities, just like the opportunity that we did get into yesterday, right over here at the 281 crane levels
smash up the like button, subscribe to the channel if you're new, and i will see you in the next one
how is everyone doing? hope you're all having a fantastic monday
are we gonna create a double bottom? or are we going to absolutely crush the support level and continue to the downside? this is something that we are going to analyze right now, at this moment
but with yesterday's analysis, there was a, you know, a trade that was worth taking
but trading from your phone is fine if you actually have done the analysis properly at home
so this was pretty cool, because on yesterday's live stream, it was mentioned that this level over here, the 281, 282, had massive confluence
and if we take a look at what happened to bitcoin, we actually came all the way up to retest the trend line, actually breaking a little bit slightly above this level
and getting this big, massive rejection and continuing to the downside
you can go in minute, uh 14 here on yesterday's live stream, looking for that rejection
but the amount of confluence that was here was absolutely huge
we were getting rejected here from this resistance trend line
and just on the 15minute chart, when we were creating this kind of double top, i actually gave, not gave the signal
i actually said, i am taking this short position, entering here at 281
when we got the second lower high, getting that rejection from this range, finally having this massive move to the downside
i haven't been trading bitcoin for the last four days, approximately four or five days, because i made insane couple of weeks and, yeah, this is the thing, you know, we, i wasn't looking to trade on the weekend
did the live stream yesterday, doing the analysis, looking at this 281, 282 k level to get that reaction, waiting patiently, waiting for the price to actually get rejected on the second attempt here
and that was enough for me to say, right, this is very likely going to fail to continue to the upside
now, we did have a big, massive wick here, okay, to the downside
maybe some people were actually, you know, trying to over leverage along this
and if we take a look at fib levels from the from the top of the range
okay? from the actual drop, you know, we could have taken the fibonacci from this level, from this level, right? this is sideways consolidation right there
so, you know, fibonacci starts from from the actual top to the to the lowest part of this major drop
and we were actually, you know, getting that volatility above the six 618
okay? you've got the resistance trend line here with the lower highs right over there
we have a major support level right over here that was created
okay? also, on the 11th of june, getting that bounce, that was enough confluence for me to say, you know, it is very, very likely after the second attempt
and this is why you need to wait for the price action to come to you, wait for the reaction
this is exactly what was mentioned on yesterday's live stream, guys
you can check it out, minute 14 on the live stream, waiting for that exact move that happened
and here is the proof of taking that exact trade here, from that 281 k levels
guys, knowing how to take profits, knowing how to take your position, protect your position, knowing how to ride the trend
so this is actually a good moment to potentially take most of the profits
i'm actually going to close all of my position very, very likely at this level, very likely by the end of the live stream
because why am i going to close this range? why am i going to close most of my profit? because if we take a look at the full hourly and zoom in right now, you know, the possibility of a double bottom is very, very possible
it was a small swing trade, of course, because it was a trade from yesterday
but i was looking for, you know, one two day trade, looking for this potential move to the downside
also on yesterday's live stream, it was very important to note that we were, i was expecting this potential drop to the downside
why did we have this such aggressive drop down here? if someone can explain to me in the comment section, and i can give you a brief explanation right now
the reason why we did have this aggressive drop is that we did lose the strongest value area low from the trading range for the last 30 days
the moment we start losing the 28 600 the drop that back down to retest the lows is going to be pretty, pretty fast, guys, because you've lost the value area low from this trading range
because the price action in between 25k levels and 286 was very, very fast
so very likely, once you break this 28 600 range, the price action to come down to retest the lows is also going to be very, very fast, guys
it is just looking at charts for hours and hours and hours, for many, many years, understanding the ranges, understanding the impulsive moves
and this was mentioned on, you know, the last few videos, guys, you can check it out, last few live streams, you know, expecting a potential fast movement, okay? with some dead cat bouncers, with some retracements, yes, that could happen
it only took a few days to come down to retest this 25k level after breaking twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
and if you have been following the channel for the last few days, for the last few weeks, was very much expected, this move to the downside, guys
i, i mean, i'm repeating myself here, because i'd still have people asking me, you know, a couple of questions, uh, people out in the telegram group, just a few minutes ago, saying, you know, can you do an overview of what you what you mentioned on yesterday's live stream in your trade? you can check it for yourself, live stream is still there
okay, looking for that rejection from this level and continue back down
and this is why it is important for you guys, anybody that is actively trading, anybody that has over 500 usdt in their buybit account
and if not, you can sign up down below right away and claim your insane bonus of up to thousand and fifty dollars
and you have also thirty days of zero percent, make a fee, because there is a huge competition going on on by bit
and i need people in my team, because we're gonna absolutely crush it
i mean, the risk to reward on this trade is a five to one at least
wasn't expecting this aggressive drop by, you know, early this morning
okay, if we do not win the competition, right over here, 79 people in my team, guys
guys, if you belong to my team, i'm gonna be waking up early in the morning
you know, mainly bitcoin and ethereum and a couple of altcoins, not much more than that
we do not need to analyze 10, 20 cryptocurrencies for the competition, but we're going to absolutely get into the best entries into yeah, guys, i'm really excited for this because it can be absolutely huge
okay? being first, there's going to be a lot of people, there, a lot of professional traders
it's going to be very difficult to end up first, okay? but it is possible
guys, make sure to scroll down, join the team, join also the telegram group
whoever joins the telegram, okay, for the competition that is not in the team will be eliminated from the, from the group, guys
this group is only going to be for the 20 days of the competition, then we're going to delete the group
whoever's joining, okay, is just wasting their time, because they will be eliminated
all right? we don't need a huge amount of people there, because everybody's gonna give their opinion
only people that are competing, okay, that want to win this huge prize pool, and that is in the competition
i know 79 people inside of my group, and there's over 120 in the telegram group
so there's people that have joined the telegram group that, um, okay
uh, people that have joined the telegram that are not in the trading group
i know they want to take advantage of good trades, potentially, that we're gonna do
and i know people want to join because, yeah, it's a competition
why not join the telegram group and take advantage of that? uh, yeah
this telegram group is only for people that are in the team of buybit for the world series of trading
like i said, the possibility of a double bottom right now is very, very possible
but what happens if we do break this zone? okay? what happens if we do break the zone? then i'm gonna explain
you know, the strongest level that we do have is right over here, the 238
this is where the price action could get a reaction, could get a major bounce, and potentially going to long this range
okay, what range? you can see here, in december of 2020, there's a strong, strong consolidation here for about a week
and the daily, there's several daily closes, several daily closes here
so, um, yeah, the 238 could be a level, if we do break this low, where we could get a potential bounce, and it might be a very good trading opportunity
guys, just wanted to go through yesterday's live stream, the trade, you know, this major drop
if you absolutely enjoy it, absolutely destroy that like button right now
i knew, i know that a lot of people watching the livestream haven't smashed up the like button
and you know, this is absolutely total free content that i put every single day, analysis for you guys
so you need to absolutely destroy that like button for the algorithm to grow the channel
mohammed is sending a school here saying, you know, this is, bitcoin is doomed
this is, we are living in the best opportunity moment of of the light of a lifetime
but the thing is, you know, people, you know, millionaire, millionaires are made in recessions, in strong recessions and big, big market crashes
okay? and this is could be, you know, one of the biggest market crashes that we are going to start experiencing for the next coming months
and i want bitcoin down at ten thousand dollars, because i will be buying a huge amount of bitcoin if we do go down to those levels
guys, you know, you need to absolutely, i have people, you know, uh, some people are, you know, scared
some people are saying, you know, bitcoins got gonna be doomed
you know, it's the best opportunity you could have in a lifetime, guys
anyway, not financial advice, of course, but i'm pretty excited for, for, for this bear market, because the amount of accumulation that i'll be doing is going to be absolutely insane
um, i did make some pretty good gains, but i didn't make huge amount of gains
and you know, this time i will be making very, very important amount of money, in my personal opinion, you know, for the next coming years
are you excited in, you know, excited for this big, massive bear market? you know, are you excited? are you excited? guys? because i am
are you excited for this big, massive bear market? and i know a lot of people are kind of depressed
i asked how many people invested in 2021, in 2022 in cryptocurrency
a lot of people are in the red, and i totally understand this
but, you know, guys, this is the moment that you need to be excited
why not? you know, 300 ethereum? that would be absolutely insane
so, yeah, i'm, i'm stacking up bitcoin, ethereum and stable coins
if anybody wants to know, not all coins just yet, because i do see the downside potential for bitcoin
and, uh, all coins could still even drop 90 for from their value right now
so, yeah, we're still waiting for lower, for accumulation of all coins anyway, let's take a look
felipe, how are you doing? well, well, it's going to be very, very hard to read most of the comment sections, but yeah, i just want to say hello to my mods
let me just go through the super chat, and i'll go quickly to say hello
do you think engine can hit 20 cent? and is it a good accumulation zone? says nepalese, noir
i mean, we've got a long time since we've done analysis on engine
um, let's zoom out on the daily and actually, let's go to the threeday chart and zoom out a little bit
this is, uh, can it go down to 20 cents? well, we have lost this big, important range
crypto is going to be, it's going to be feeling like it's dead
um, a lot of the cryptos are actually having this kind of pattern
it's pretty curious because, you know, amazon back in the 2000 did a very, very similar pattern
a lot of people comparing this, you know, with the dotcom bubble
why not? because there was a lot of dotcom, you know, websites that were, you know, they were offering something that wasn't real yet
you know, these last few years, big, massive speculation bubble has popped, and we're gonna see, you know, a couple of years, potentially
you know, it might be six months, because technology and adoption are is much faster every single time, every decade
um, so it's, yeah, if you see social media adoption, wow, social media, in 10 years, it went absolutely insane
um, so adoption in cryptocurrency and decentralization in bitcoin, you know, the the monies people, you know, the adoption could be really, really faster
so we cannot actually compare it with a dotcom verbal exactly
but you know, it's very likely we're going to see six to 18 months of very, very boring price action to the downside, even more, more blood in the streets
and the good, good projects are going to be ones that will survive
engine is a pretty popular, you know, um, project that's in the gaming space, nft space, uh, i wouldn't, you know, i couldn't be 100 on that, but it might be one of them that will, uh, survive
now, you are talking, can 20 cent be the ultimate low? well, i think, i think so
20 cent, 25 cent has been a massive resistance zone where the price action of engine has been trading for, you know, in 2019, 2020, a big, big accumulation zone
and we might be trading in the next coming months, okay, weeks, months above that accumulation zone
so that is definitely, in my opinion, a very good level of accumulation, especially if bitcoin is bearish
are we looking more for more downside on on bitcoin? maybe we're looking for more downside on bitcoin, but not much more
guys, i know people want to bet get bitcoin at 18k, at 15k, at 10k
guys, if you do not, dollar cost average, you'll be missing out on a lot of opportunities
dollar cost average is the best way of investment in my my opinion, especially for bitcoin, ethereum and some cryptos
you know, people that are waiting for lower, are waiting for lower, are the ones that very likely miss out on on on a big amount of investment
so anyway, your question, keeping it simple, 20 25 cents can be actually the ultimate low range for engine
we could have some volatility, a few cents up, a few cents down
but if bitcoin does continue to the downside, you know, this is already um, i wouldn't start accumulating at this moment
one of the main reasons why is because, you know, after a bubble pop like this, after a bubble pop, you know, a vshaped recovery, you know, in the next coming months, it's just very unlikely to happen, guys
you will know when the bottom is in or near when you start going sideways, okay? and start, you know, sideways for a few months, and, you know, making pumps dumps, pumps and dumps, and not actually dropping from a zone um below a support level, or not um pumping from above a resistance level
okay? you will know when it's a good accumulation zone when you start making this kind of price action
when you start making this kind of price action is when you know that this is an accumulation zone, when you know, when you make this kind of price action, you know this is an accumulation zone
price action is moving sideways in a range for several months, and that is when you need to buy up
well, you have had a few weeks, but, you know, you want the several months you want several months of sideways action
you want to get it, you're going to get some pumps inside there
you know, i'll be saying, guys, this is absolutely phenomenal
i will be here also, um, telling you what i am buying and, um, yeah, this is what i am waiting for, basically, on a lot of the altcoins, you know, waiting for that sideways action
expect that for the rest of 2022, and even slightly more to the downside
and let's, you know, you guys will be much nicer to me when btc is at 14k, says paul christopher
i mean, this is the thing so many people right now are absolutely calling, you know, 10k, 12k, 14k, 16k
these levels might not hold a lot of people want to buy bitcoin at those levels
but, you know, dollar cost averaging is the best thing you can do
you're right, because you will enter an average price from this 20, you know, from 25k to 15k
if you start dollar cost averaging at these levels, 25k, you know, 23k, you might jump back up to 28k
okay, there's not going to be much difference for the next coming years
how are you? el habib um ben, how are you doing? have a nice week, bro, and all the crypto legends has been engined, a very strong supporter, always giving a sign of strength and a thunder in the comment section
um, wtf happened with bitcoin? el habib, we were very much expecting this drop
what happened was the highest probability scenario, and that was coming down to retest these low levels, okay, with maybe some small relief rallies
the stream from the 11th of june, when we were slightly breaking this 28 600, and i was saying, you know, this might not drop as hard because it's the weekend
you know, this is what happened, the high probability scenario, continuing back down, because we lost the value area low from this big, massive monthly trading range, the 28 600, the price action below that was fast
so we are going to make that fast price action as soon as we break this level, guys
i want to make it extremely simple for you guys to understand
you lose a value area low from a big trading range, you're going to come down fast to that low part
i will be making a trading course after the summer, being absolutely insanely simplified, because a lot of the cryptocurrencies courses that are out there are just too much information
and too much information is just gonna get your head crazy, and you don't know when to get in, when to get out, where's your stoploss, where's your take profit? and it's just too much information out there, guys
and i want to make the most professional, simplified cryptocurrency course that there could be out there by, you know, after the summer
i'm not going to give a date, because i will be working on the structure
and i want to make it super, super simplified, really, really easy, friendly, um, course to understand
and you do not need the huge amount of in over information that there is out there
if this attempt has a big, massive wick and comes back up with high volume and potentially gonna long it
if we do have a swing failure pattern at this level, we can see a reaction here on the one hourly
look how many one hourly candles we've been trading at this range, at the 25 000 area for over five hours right now
it's time to long one once you see multiple attempts trying to break low
if this the drop, has a massive fail and we wick back above the low here, we which back above this low area
if we do something like this, boom, i might potentially long it, long at this range as soon as we get above
guys, if you were active on the telegram group, i know there was a couple of people that were active asking me, you know, are you shorting? have you seen the prize? it's at that level that you mentioned
and where i entered, where i entered the short position was here, was exactly here from this rejection
you know, i can show you, it's on by bit the, you know, the short is there
it was there, right here, expecting and, you know, did i short on this big pump over here? no, i mean, this is super, uh, you know, super important, guys
if you are a mentor, if you are someone that's educational, i am also an influencer
but, yeah, you know, if you've been long here enough, you know, i really try to be transparent and look at those big, big probability trades and, and good risk management is absolute key
i was aware of the price being at these levels and, you know, this second attempt fail, this lower high was enough for me to say, this is very likely, with high probability, going to roll back down
and the probabilities go higher once you wait for that reaction
say, you know, for example, just to give a number, you know, you have 60 of chances of this price action to actually continue to the downside
yesterday, talking about this major resistance trend line, you know, this major support level reacting right there
we have the six, one, eight, okay? slightly above from this major drop
but you have even higher probabilities on the second attempt here
the price cannot manage to get above the 282 thousand dollars
you want to have a stop loss above this, wick, slightly above, because you can get that double top scenario
so you will be losing this amount of, uh, you know, of capital
you just get stopped out, and you can jump back in in a trade if you see that big, big rejection
so, you know, what is the risk to reward? well, you can, you guys can see this, you know
and if you can take profits, protect your position if you in a massive, big entry, you know
i can get stopped out ten times, you know, out of this trade, because i have really good risk management, and i good and i know how to take profits, and i know how to protect, protect my position
i mean, for me, it's huge, the amount of the huge community that i am creating
um, i want to make a really active discord group after the summer, for trading
and if you are experienced trader, if you, you know, if you are on buybit
and if you're not an eur, experience check out the bonus down below
there is the link to join my buy bit team, because we're gonna absolutely crush it
uh, i've got, you know, let's see how many people have signed up since this live stream
we're gonna arrive to a hundred and even more, and we're going to absolutely crush it
guys, join the telegram group for the competition, only people of the competition
don't try to join it, because you will be out just a few days before
i will find out who is not in the competition, and, um, yeah, we'll you'll be eliminated
we're going to absolutely crush the trades here on the competition
and i was saying, you know, i haven't been trading for the last, for the last, um, well, the last four days on bitcoin
you know, i just felt, you know, i just didn't feel like trading
and then yesterday analysis, you know, i will potentially take this trade
and and the reason why is because, like i said, i i'm going to explain this every single time
you know, i'm gonna go in on and on and on, because people do ask several times
the probabilities in us continuing to the downside aggressively was very, very high
but we look, we wait patiently for the biggest opportunity, for the best entry, that retracement here to the massive level of confluence to ride this trade all the way down to these levels
and there it is, guy, the trade is there, entry at 281 k levels
i was speculating for this harmonic to actually, you know, go to this range
i no, actually exited with a small loss here, almost that break, even just a small loss
you can get stopped out 20 times and have three good trades that you will be paid off with those 20 stocks
of course, i don't get stopped out that many times, but just so you can understand that risk management is absolutely key
and i'm so sorry, because i'm not reading the comment section, guys
i'm really, really bad right now these last few days, interacting
but i've got the question here in, the uh, you know, the pool
are you excited for this big, massive bear market? i've got 70 percent of people saying, yes
this is the the mentality that you need to have that, you know, be excited at these, you know, sad moments, right? these are sad moments for bitcoin and crypto
whatever it does, we want to find the highest probability trade
and if this does fail to break right now, in the next coming hours, it is highly probable we're going to have a relief rally before we continue back down
where are we going to have those relief pumps at strong levels? this low area is a, is a major zone
it's still very early to know if we're going to get a bounce or if we're going to break down the moment
on the one hourly chart, we've got 10 minutes to close this one hourly
if we, if we close above this range and still have some volatility here, uh, relief rally is almost imminent
you're going to have some kind of a relief rally at least to the 382 if we do continue this consolidation and get a bounce back up
am i? am i long in this? no, only if we do continue to go sideways, if we do see a couple of wicks here trying to break this low, then i will potentially, you know, enter a quick long trade into the bounce
uh? and yeah, definitely looking for that 382 at least, maybe 50 percent
so 26k on on this relief rally is very, very likely, especially gaining this high wick over here
so in between 382 and 50, you know, we want to claim these wicks over here
you know, if i, i prefer to not take a trade and only enter the highest probability trades
guys, you only need a few trades a month to absolutely crush it with gains
it's been dead many, many times, many, many times for the last few years
my altcoin portfolio, chain link and everything is just absolutely bleeding
it's the best, the the best times that we're going to live in now, the last, you know, the next six to 18 months, a lot of blood in the market
um, the short was, yesterday, the short, the shorting opportunity was going up here to this, twenty eight thousand six
this range, the 50 618, was the shorting range mentioned on yesterday's live stream
um, shorting right now is is very, very risky, especially with a high leverage
um, does it mean it's gonna happen? no, uh? can we go lower from this range? absolutely yes
okay, stay cautious, because this level could get a big, big bounce
we have a huge spike on the vpvr at this range, but it's not a huge one
but a big bounce to make some quick gains is very, very possible at that range, if we do hit it
you need to have your levels marked, be ready to once you hit that reaction, you decide if you want to enter, to have good risk management for a potential good trade
guys, how low can we go many questions that i do get in telegram, in the community
don't worry, guys, i will be getting the best course that could, you know, you could potentially do, because the courses that are out there have too much information
this is a major level where we could get that bounce, where we could potentially stop the twenty three thousand, um, eight hundred dollars
so expect maybe a wick down to that range and a big, big relief rally
you can always easily protect your position very, very quickly as soon as the price moves several hundred hundreds of dollars to the upside um
so, yeah, anyway, it looks like that the price is getting weaker and weaker
um, i mean, if we, if we have an aggressive drop right now, if we, i'm gonna, i'm gonna catch this falling knife, just because i do think that this twenty three, 23, 800 range is a huge huge level um if we do fall down there in the next coming minutes, or if we do have a massive recovery getting above the 24 800, this is potentially a small swing failure pattern
and and we we actually going to get that double one of scenario that did cut bounce
we get if we close above this low over here, which is the um, the twenty four thousand eight hundred and eleven dollars right there
if we do close above this level, which i think it's very unlikely, we've only got five minutes
price looks like wants to go lower, then, of course, then i would be looking for that dead gap bounce for the moment
you want to know where the price can stop? that is a major level
and we also have, you know, the daily level here from this big reaccumulation that we did have back in december of 2020
huge reaccumulation zone, slightly breaking above alltime high
we've got the alltime high levels where we consolidated before the breakout
i'm going to leave in five minutes because i've got stuff to do
i will be doing another, i want to do another live stream afterwards
let's, i'm going to try it and make it for the new york opening, okay, um, which is half three here, century, european time
but yeah, i mean, a major level, the 238 range could get a big bounce
um, one hourly, we we're probably going to close above this low
we can maybe create that, this double bottom scenario in the short term
um, yeah, expect a big relief rally? where can that big relief rally go to? the relief rally can potentially go from this drop, to the low part, to this 50, 618 at least, to the to the 259, at least
the 382 is very, very likely to be reached, and and potentially higher
um, only if we close above this range, only if we have another couple of more hours here
if we are above 248 and we go sideways, uh, you know, we you are looking for that double bottom scenario
yeah, it's still, it's still very likely going to drop only sideways, only sideways action for the next couple of hours, having that swing failure, i will be confident that this is gonna have a big relief rally, only if that happens
if you i bet a lot of them are new people, new subscribers, you know, because of the of the thumbnail, you know, bitcoin price dropping
if any new subscribers check out yesterday's live stream, you need to check out yesterday's live stream to understand what we were looking for here
anyway, absolutely crush that like button and smash the like button
how are you doing, mariella? mark dutch, joseph, let's take a look
did it manage to reach 1 920? we were looking at a harmonic pattern
um, oh, it's still, it still can, i think it still will manage to go higher
we were looking at this bat pattern on um, on gold, looking for that 9 000, sorry, that 1 920
this is very likely going to go up there in the next coming weeks, i said, because, yeah, gold is a very, very slow mover
it's very lightly going to hit that level in the next coming days, potentially with high probability
the trade that i entered was here, i got stopped out at breakeven because, yeah, i i put stopped that, uh, stop loss at break even because we had this movement, a little bit of a too large consolidation for my, but my style here
but anyway, we were getting highly supported on gold from these higher lows
uh, there's still high probability in gold going to the 1 920
it's the six, one, eight, from the c point to the point of this bat harmonic pattern, then potentially getting a big rejection from that range
um, but yeah, i do see the price action of gold going up to the 1 920
you have this beautiful bat pattern over here on the d point, getting supported from the higher lows
i do see gold in the next coming days, maybe a week or so, hitting the 1 920 with high probability
i've got a natural gas also is looking very, very interesting
i know a lot of people, um, expect natural gas to go to insane high levels
but i think a potential large correction is likely in the coming days
in the next couple of weeks, we entering the summer consumption in natural gas is going to decline
and, like i said, you know, before, the massive event that is happening
um, you know, smart investors invest already here in in february, okay, and march, before the actual, you know, what is happening
i don't want to be talking of any of that, but, uh, we can, i can see here a distribution event
smart money, i think, is leaving the market at these peaks, because we entering the summer
we've had massive, you know, fear with natural gas and oil prices
it just doesn't make any sense that this is going to go much higher from this range
i'm actually in a very small short position here on on primex bt
you know, there's, they have a huge amount of assets, and they are using bitcoin ethereum or stable coins as collateral, which is absolutely insane, because this is my platform to accumulate bitcoin
and the good thing is that you get seven percent added to your deposit
okay, seven percent added to your deposit if you use my link down below
i recommend, you know, the ones that i recommend, okay, is primex bt and by bit
of course, there are other good ones, such as femacs, such as magix, bitget
but the ones that i use consistently for my trading is primex bt and buybit
and on prime xbt, you get seven percent added to your deposit, which is huge
you deposit ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred dollars on top
you deposit one hundred thousand dollars, you're getting seven thousand dollars on top of that to trade with
so i've got full tutorials on on primex bt and buy bit down below, guys, if you are interested
if we do consolidate the next coming hours at this range, you know, that really bigger relief rally is very, very real, guys
let's see where we can find some bigger opportunities on bitcoin
if we start consolidating and go to these high levels, six one eight would be the ideal
why is six one eight ideal from this major drop? because of the massive volume that we did have here on this relief rally
we're gonna back test the back of this major level, hitting the six one eight
back testing the back of this big volume range with the six one eight is enough confluence for me
if we do see a reaction at this range, it is going to be a massive, big shorting opportunity, guys
we're only looking for the highest probability trades if we get that relief rally, just like we did yesterday, waiting patiently for that move to the upside
on yesterday's stream at that 282, we reached that level here beautifully
i'm waiting for the price action to come to me at this 618 level, round about the 267, and also at the 23 800, a major daily zone
for me, my most important level right now is twenty three thousand eight hundred dollar level for a bigger relief rally
it's a huge, strong level from price action in december of 2020 on bitcoin
and also the 26 700 area, looking for that 618 range consolidation
if we do get a relief rally, it would be an easy trade if we consolidate and get rejected here
uh, guys, if you want to join my trading competition, the link is down below
on my favorite trading platforms, five of it in primax bt, that i use almost every single day
check out the bitcoin census website if you want to find, you know, nice articles and news regarding regarding bitcoin and other cryptos
um, just one second, i'm just gonna give everyone the content, so we can start this monday with some charts
we're just gonna wait for some people to jump into this train
we need to wait for some people to drop into this live stream
victor, how are you? are we dropping today? no, we're just going straight up
are you if you haven't already liked the live stream, please come inside and do that
if we go back in time, um, we are right now breaking the 618 level
and this is something that i also did expect the market to do
and you should not be either, because you've been on my live streams, and you've also known, uh, you've also known about this, right? so no one is in shock
but to look at the the next level, uh, we can come back down to is around 23 300
i was in a really great call yesterday, another great, great trader
and i was about to record it, and i did that, but then i didn't close the music behind on obs
so when he was talking, the music in the background, we're talking more than he did
so now, after this live stream, i have to look at that, and i just can't hear what this guy is saying
he's really good, but i have to see what he does and just try to figure out everything
and i just wanted to listen to that, because he's obviously very good
and i just want to listen to it and just see what it can, how much it can help me
the more i practice, the better i become, the better knowledge i have, and i can obviously share that with you guys
so i'm gonna sit and study that today and see whatever he said
so i'm definitely gonna sit there today and, um, listen to it
like, why do we buy the market? why do we sell the market? we see an engulfing candle, but why isn't an engulfing candle? we're not the one moving the market
why does the people who does the market move the market the way they do? right? so i'm def i definitely look forward to practice more on combining the fundamentals with the technical analysis and the psychology
but, uh, definitely want to develop even more when it comes to trading, right? and i think everyone here wants to do that
but, um, in looking at the bitcoin chart now, we're obviously having one, we just, we're just dropping, um, and the next level is obviously 23 and 300, 200
so on the two daily chart, you can see even more clear, uh, this is this, uh, push to the upside
if we break 23, 200, the next level for us to drop back down to
now, i'm only looking at previous support and resistance levels to see where we can potentially come to
but, um, the lower we come, the better price we'll have then when we buy the market, right? because the market, the market will go up
i cannot, i don't think bitcoin will just, like, it can obviously happen, but i don't think that
but remember, guys, that what goes down must go up, right? but right now we just need to have some patience
the market is not moving upwards any and not soon at least we can come up, but a little bit, obviously, and then consolidate
so i don't think you should be scared or anything at this point
how are you? ginger christopher edgardo, hello, how are you? dominic at the crypto clan, hello
i mean, okay, so we're gonna go into, uh, so yesterday on our live stream we did look at forex factory
and this is a platform where i look at the news coming the news coming out
so this week would be crazy, because we can see that we do have plenty of red usdt boxes here
so we will have a lot of things happening in the market, not just on usd
we have, we have on the we did have on, okay, so gbp is also very red this week
so whatever you trade, if you trade forex, if you trade crypto index, whatever, everything's just gonna move like crazy this week
even if we, even if you don't use fundamentals, we always have to know that fundamentals also effect affect the market
and if you don't know that, on um, wednesday to uh 8, at 8 00 pm or 2 30 pm, if you don't know that these news are coming out, you just might get so fake, not faked out, but you you just your purse, you just might lose your position
and maybe if you over leverage, etc, etc, you will just be pissed off
so this is why it's very important for us to understand, even if we don't use fundamental at least you at least know if something big happening
so with some coffee, we go to dxy right away, going to the higher time frames, monthly chart
and if you hear the seagulls in the background, trust me, in my head, they they don't exist
so if you hear them in the background, i do apologize about that
but looking at the xy, we're coming back up, and we test a previous little lower low around 105700
these are definitely levels that you can see the market pull back from, right? because when you come to previous support and resistance zones, you will see the resistance, right? um, but, and if that's the case, we'll see, obviously, on bitcoin, some movements to the upside, because they're correlating against each other
um, with some back testing, this is what i noticed, right so and youtube
we broke the three monthly, we broke the threemonth fibonacci level
i spoke about this, and this is definitely something that, um, we did expect the market to do
but, i mean, if we, if the market goes crazy, crazy, we can come back down and retest this previous resistance
but you never say never, right? but we do have some other levels we need to break first
but slippage through the 618 percent usually happens, and then see market pull back inside
and hopefully will not, we will not break the first low that the market will create right here, uh, down here somewhere
and if you did listen to the video that i spoke about a couple of days ago, you know that usually when the market breaks the higher time frames humanology, it creates one support, and from that support, slowly and steady, even if the market consolidates, you usually don't break it
and then you just see the market very choppy, just go bouncing in between
but as i told you, it never comes back down to break that first low
so i just, i'm just waiting for that first load to be created
and after that, if i see that the market, if it looks like it actually, if it looks like it actually create that low, i will just add buy orders
it doesn't matter if the market goes sideways, but as long as i have that confirmation, with that support, it's just, i'm just good to go, you know
so i definitely think that this is a, great, uh, this looks actually great for the longterm target for bitcoin to swallow instead of moved to the upside
i got a nice trade with being b equals a little bit early, but never a mistake taking, oh, that's great, carlos
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
and then we're just going to go straight to the coins that you want me to look at
as i told you, we did have a live stream, not so many was it 10 hours ago or something? it was actually a really great stream
we come back down to one thousand and three and one thousand, one thousand two hundred right now
and, um, so, yeah, one thing that i think that i would want to do, it takes a little bit of time, but i think i want to calculate some key levels from the support that we have, both from bitcoin and on it, especially, especially bitcoin, and then maybe on ethereum, too
but i, i want to show you, uh, first ethereum, the other points, and then at the end of the live stream, i will give you the key levels that i think we can have on bitcoin, that i think can be very important
i, i did expect the market, uh, to potentially, i don't remember exactly where we were yesterday, um, i think
i did expect the market to potentially, just, also, because it's monday, that it would, um, cool, back up, right? but it never did that
but remember, the market will not just drop, drop, drop, drop
so instead, it reversed back up to give us another potential sell opportunity
because when the market is dropping the way it does right now, it's really hard for me to, you know, to find a self position, because you can obviously just see the market give you a quick pull back now, and then see the market drop even more
so i'm just going to let the market move a little bit during the day
and maybe during london's new york session today, we, i have some great setups, who knows
i will try to go on a live stream later today, also, depending on how the market looks, because mondays can be a little bit, you know
but on, um, we can definitely, okay, so if we see a pullback, now, just thinking about it, uh, we can come back up and retest the 618 that we broke, because that is a previous week
but we just might come back up and retest it as a resistance again around 1460, and then just might see the market reverse back up down
so if we start to see that, the market begins to be bullish right now, and you start to see some movements to the upside, if we break above the supports at 1335, we are retesting this level right now
so if we continue to see the drop, it can actually, it could definitely take us back down to 1250
um, but if we start to see the market having some high movements and higher lows, we're looking at the 1460 because that is the three monthly fibonacci level that we broke, right? so, yeah, it doesn't didn't look good
on ethereum, so we're just going to go straight into your coins, so we can just try to look at as many coins as possible
and then we're going to go, and i'll, i'll give you the key levels on bitcoin
does that sound good? boys? uh, does that sound good? now i do that weird voice again sometimes, of course
i don't know exactly when we did look at this before, um, but we definitely came back up and retested the support perfectly at seventy seven point three
that's what i think we can come we can do it when it comes to aave, first of all, because, and what's it on the weekly chart, maybe
so we're using the clothes of the previous body, and that is around 50, right? so now we understand what we look at
this is the previous, i don't know if we have anything, uh, and any more data from us, previous prices, but on bitcoin, on trading view, i cannot see that
but this is a previous resistance, also a previous little support
but this is, thank you, crypto pizza, but the echo is not nice
so if we would see a pullback on aave, and we're dragging fibonacci from the high, 764 dollars back down to the um
so it's one hour, it's 37 minutes left of this green candlestick
so i'm gonna take, if we're closing with this green candlestick, we can have the um, we can have the fibonacci against 634
and on the lower time frames, the same thing that i showed you on ethereum
if we see the market break above, uh, 645 and potentially create this previous support as a new support, this could be where we see aave pull back up to 699 or 714, uh, dollars
and from this level, uh, we can see the market pull back down again
if we don't see the market pull back up and retest this previous report that we did break uh, 751, around that level
but if we, if we also look at where the fibonacci level is, you can see that this is also where the previous lower low and support was, right? you can see
and if this fibonacci level is valid or if this resistance, as previous support, will be a a valid um resistance that take us back down, take profit one will be 604
so we've been going through bitcoin, dxy and ethereum, and i see jamal sell the house
um, my morning have been brightening for the first day this week
okay, guys, what else do you want me to look at this morning? i think i saw something before
okay, so, wait, can't withdraw your bucks? yes, celsius down 50
what did you say? are we going to 20k? yes, darling, definitely
lpt, usdt, i think that we're, we're just gonna look at this one, because it takes some time for me when, uh, when i do the key level
so we're just gonna look at lpt, and then we're just gonna go straight to to the bitcoin chart again
and hopefully we have the time to do ethereum, also, oh, ah, don't really know what to say more than we're going down on this baby
uh, nuts their rumors feeling that celsius stops their withdrawal because they are, oh, that is not good
so based on this fibonacci that we had from this move, we're about to reach, uh, take profit two and one
next target, first to come back down to, based on this fibonacci, is six point 671
but if we would see the market pull back up a little bit for a preview for a retest of a level, the first level that i look at is 940 dollars for a potential retest, and then we just might see the market continue back down
and i'm gonna, uh, calculate the i'll see if we find some good key levels from this little baby
so you're ready to go? i just want to see where i can find the best
it doesn't matter what type of chart you're in, you will always do that
okay, so the bird's going crazy outside, and they're working outside, so i do apologize for it
oh, okay, darling, then why are you even here? why are you even here if this is not fit you? i guess you're a really good trader yourself, so i don't understand why you're on youtube searching for other people
why are people so mean? um, i know guys that you're like, oh, yeah
but you can just add it yourself, not only in your head, but trust me, i will
i took these key levels, right? we can go down to the lower time frames
and i actually think i want to add some more if we start to see, um, if we start to see some movements to the upside, because the market will respect them
natalie speaking, i finally start to make money, so please let her speak
and, oh, so happy to hear that you guys start to earn money, even though i'm never a financial advisor
now, it looks very, very messy, right? but the market is bouncing in between these levels
and can you see how perfectly we took away everything right? we took away everything on the chart, and you can already see how the market was bouncing in between these key levels
you can also see how we almost came back, we broke it, almost came back up
i just want to show you, if we go back in time, these levels are very important, because you can see how the market is bouncing in between and retesting them
if we just go back in time, the market is retesting these levels so perfectly
so if you break one level, you come back down to the next one
um, we can obviously take more just to see how it looks up here, but we don't have the time for that
but to look at okay, so the key levels that i have right now on the six monthly chart, they are based where is the chart
we want to figure out where the market is based on these key levels
because if i want to see where the lower highs are, we want to, we would take it from the from the high, right? but this is where we want to see the market, where it can reverse to the upside from, um, going back down to the daily
it looks so messy on the charts right now, but that is totally fine
we had the 15 61 slightly above 33 040 and slightly below 27 040
um, screenshot this if you want to, and use these key levels and just see how the market is bouncing in between them
so these one, this is on the six monthly chart, so these are very respected
and we could see the market bouncing between, as i told you, 29 and 31 000k and now we just might see the market bounce in between, um, if we start to see some consolidation, but i don't think that will happen
but if we pull back up, we either retest the the fibonacci at 26 319, or probably come back up and retest 27 040
and as i told you, if you break that level, the next key level is 20 21, 040, etc, etc
we obviously don't have to have all of them on the chart, because it's also going to mess up your brain when you look at the chart
i i can't analyze the market when i have these many lines, because my brain is just going, you know
but it's always really good to have key levels to when we see the mark, to where we see the market right now
so i when if i have key levels on the charts, i just take away the ones that is not accurate at the moment
and then if we start to see that the market reaches these levels, i just add it, because i know exactly what i did right
so i just go back and see, okay, we just put minus then, and we just, you know, add the other key levels depending on to where we are at the moment
looks like there's no support in in bear, and there's no resistance in a bowl right now
we're just, the market is just breaking, you know how it's just going down, right? i'm just gonna take these ones away too
also a very important level for us if we see some pullback to the upside
so this is a level, uh, we could definitely see us come back up and retest
not now, maybe not tomorrow, but at least, you know, these coming days
um, so between 28 530 and 29 050, this is a great level for us to look at for another reverse back down
if we break above it, you know, we can definitely come back up to higher targets
but we're still in a downtrend, so just because we see the market, um, pull back up later, it doesn't mean it will do that
but we're still below the trend line also, that i took off on the daily from the high we connected with the lower highs
and if we see the market pull back up to the support, again, previous support, that is also pretty good, combined with the trend line, if we break the trend line, and if we start to see more momentum to the upside if we break above the so with the prices that we have right now, the last lower high is 31 and 300
but if we would see the market in a this week, couple of weeks, break above 31 and 300, this could be where we see bigger push to the upside
but then remember, on the three monthly charts, i want to see how it looks if we take it from the low, low, 30, 3800
okay, this one is definitely the one that we're gonna use, because you can see, oh, okay, this fibonacci is so much better
okay, so the fibonacci on the threemonth chart must be from the low the 3672, to the high at uh 58 742
and can you see how perfectly the threemonth fibonacci is combined, exactly with the with the key levels, 31 040 and 25 014
but this one is so much better than the first fibonacci that i did have
so we are definitely inside a very, very we're still inside the fibonacci levels right now because i changed it a little bit
um, guys, if you, if you are new to the channel, we do have 250 people on this live stream
um, if you haven't already like the live stream, go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
if you haven't subscribed to it, please go inside and do that too, this week
i had one late livestream yesterday, and i do have these morning live streams from monday to friday, 8 am, swedish times, always this time
so and if you are a beginner when it comes to trading, or just want to know more about market structure, etc, because that is key when it comes to trading
so many other things too, but as a beginner, market structure is definitely key one, uh, you have, uh, crypto trading for beginners right here and going and just watch the videos
i have the back testing sessions also where i just back test the market so we can be better and better and better to what we in what we do
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you're supporting me and the consensus by doing that
and buy this is super great, because holding our positions for a longer time is very great when it comes to the fees
and everyone wants to have the low fees, obviously, when it comes to trading, because they can be very, very expensive sometimes
um, how do you decide the range for your levels? what do you mean range? um, hi natalie
you have to look at the market and you need to see what can you afford it
okay, so do you want to have some? uh, before i go, i'm so excited
do you want to have some key levels on ethereum, too? i wonder if she was a abba fan
it's not my type of music, but definitely something that i listened to when i grew up
but i cannot say that i start to listen to um, it's not, it's, it's not my goto songs
mckay, guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, we're 220 people on this live stream
so while i give you the key levels, you can go in and like the live stream so you can help me reach more, uh, helping to grow the channel will be super sweet of you
don't forget to subscribe to the channel, because, trust me, you don't want to miss out what i will give you in the future
and the future can be tomorrow, right where the future is tomorrow
like, i'm listening to the key the seagulls that i they're like, seriously
i don't have no i mean, do they have like, a mental breakdown or something? because they're about to give me mental breakdown
i have seagulls outside here, and they just scream every single day
can you see how frustrated i am? you would also be that if you heard that every single day
okay, looking at ethereum, now, we do have some, um, we do have some key levels, so screenshot it if you want to
i have a chicken next door because she needs some mail every day
okay, so these are the levels where, uh, yeah, we're going to go to the three monthly chart, and we're just gonna adjust them
we're gonna see where the fibonacci comes into and how it looks combined with this
so we're just going to take it from low to the high, and voila
can you see how perfectly the market is? can you see the 15 61 is combined exactly with nine? also almost, uh, 1930 and 1530
if we break this level, next key level for us to come back down to is eleven thousand
one hundred and thirty go to the we just wanna show you how it looks like
can you see, from this low that we didn't have, how how the market was retesting? and then we obviously have other key levels i'm gonna show you
so we're just going to take this key level, we'll change it to 320, and we're going to do the same thing again
this is just because i want to show you, uh, 350 plus 200, 550
so just one second, i just want to say, what's this? 3 30 plus, let's see, 200
can you see how perfectly the market came back down? exactly? almost exactly? and we tested this level
can you see how precisely the market is retesting these levels? key levels are key, guys
can you see like the market is just using them as support and resistance zones? so the levels that i gave you, remember, these are very important, but i'm not going to confuse you with the one that i just gave you from this one
so, yeah, these are, these are the key levels for ethereum, i just, you know, as i told you, screenshot it, and trust me guys when i say you'll see how the market is bouncing in between these levels
you don't always have to have them on the chart, as i told you, try to we can just try to have the ones that is close to the price
and natalie, i know you're not, um, if it was you in my position with my residential btc order at 27, would you sell a hold? in order words, would you see going up from here? or dumped? i think mark that the market will consolidate
the market will consolidate on bitcoin, even if we see the drop right now
but what i do, what i do believe the market will do, is that it will find a low, potentially, maybe around 23 or 21k
but i definitely, because you can see, we are inside, the people are slightly above the fibonacci level now at 26, 24, 680
i just, i said this a couple of minutes or months, yeah, a few minutes ago, that the market would probably find a support, a low
let's say we come back down to one, to 21, 40, just let's say
and then, you if we see so this, if we see that we're breaking inside fibonacci level against 24 and 600
and then slowly and steady you see the market holding itself, but just consolidate
but if we never break the first low, this will be the low that will potentially hold the movements that we slow instead, it will see the market then reverse to the upside, right? even if we see the market consolidate, but this the low that bitcoin for ethereum will create
but this is why it's so important for us to understand that we are inside the fibonacci level at the moment
and from the these two levels, uh, let's we're using 30 104 now and 25 040
from these levels, we can't expect the market to consolidate after it found a great support
guys, did you like this live stream? please press one, one, one in the chat
um, i need to go now because we have some things for twitter that needs to come out
i realize that bitcoin is math, but where everything when it comes to, uh, cryptocurrencies, is math
if you haven't subscribed to the channel, please go inside and do that
um, don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in description down below the video
i took some time out from the chart this weekend because i also need to, you know, sort my brains out
i will, i will do some very good back testing today for myself, and then i will come back to you later with some better, better things on the charts
don't forget that trading is, uh, the hardest game for us to be in, because it's so much, much, fundamentals, uh, psychology, everything you need to connect everything together
i will update you with another uh video later around uh, in about four or five hours
i said this two thousand a thousand times, but i can continue to talk forever
my name is josh, and today the bitcoin price entered this area of maximum opportunity as the weekly rsi enters into oversold territories for the first time since the end of the 2018 bear market
and of course, this is happening after we experienced an extremely volatile move that was predicted by the bollinger bands days in advance
but what is really interesting is, despite the recent bitcoin crash, the bitcoin whales over on bitfenix have not liquidated their long positions
and this is happening at the same time as the ethereum shot positions on the same exchange are entering into alltime low levels, which is very interesting, once again
so i'll be covering all of that and so much more for bitcoin and ethereum in this video
and later in this video, i'll be talking about what's happening with celsius, because this right here could be a growing issue for the entire crypto market
so definitely watch to the end of this video so that you don't miss out on any of these important information
and as you can see right here, the bitcoin price is clearly underneath the 1 000 day moving average, which is the green line
and the moment we confirmed that weekly candle closed below that level, we saw almost an immediate drop down towards the 200 a week moving average, as i've been talking about in recent videos here on the channel
and this 200 week moving average is coming in between 22 and 23 000 per bitcoin
and once again, if you've been keeping up with my recent videos here on the channel, especially in recent weeks, i've been talking about that 23 000 price target for quite a while due to how significant that 200 week moving average has proven to be time and time again throughout bitcoin's entire price history
but something else to keep in mind is, despite the 200week moving average providing a lot of support for the bitcoin price throughout bitcoin's entire price history, in some extremely rare occasions, we sometimes get a capitulation week below the 200week moving average
which is why i am certainly not buying on leverage at this moving average
i'm simply accumulating more bitcoin on the spot market, which cannot be liquidated
and of course, the bitcoin that i'm stacking at around 22 to 23 000, i'm holding for the much longer term
because even though it might not seem like it right now, this bearish time is only temporary, like all of these other bearish times
and just like the bullish times, the bullish times are always temporary
there's always another crash around the corner, just like how there's always another pump around the corner
and on top of the bitcoin price retracing to that 200 week moving average, we are also seeing the weekly bitcoin rsi entering into oversold territories for the first time since the end of the 2018 bear market
are the only two other times where we've seen the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories like it is right now
so once again, that is just something to keep in mind as well
and also, if we look at this chart right here, which is still the weekly bitcoin charts, but zoomed in a little bit, and bringing out the fibonacci retracement tool from the march 2020 capitulation low up to the alltime high for bitcoin, that gives us the 382 fibonacci level, which is the second most important fibonacci level, coming into play in between 22 to 23 000 per bitcoin, right at that 200 week moving average
so basically, we have a strong confluence of different indicators all pointing towards around 22 to 23k
and at the time of recording in this video, we are finding some shortterm support around that level
and if you're looking at the daily bitcoin charts, giving you a quick update on this hash ribbons indicator that i covered in yesterday's video in more detail
obviously, we have now seen a capitulation in the bitcoin price play out after we got a capitulation signal in this hash ribbons indicator
and once again, as i mentioned in my last video on the channel, if we see this signal drag out a little bit longer, for another couple weeks or so, and potentially up towards around a month, which it normally does, then in that case, it would likely flash a blue buy signal, which is the signal that i'll be paying attention to
because, historically speaking, this blue buy signal, when it shows up in a hash ramen's indicator, it is extremely accurate as a buy signal
but i won't be going too much into detail about this indicator in this video, because that's what i did in my last video
so if you're new to the channel, definitely check out my last video that i posted yesterday
and now giving you a quick update on the bollinger bands indicator on the daily bitcoin chance
and obviously, these bollinger bands are beginning to now expand
now that we've seen an extremely volatile move like these bollinger bands were suggesting a few days in advance before the move even began
in case you're new to the channel and you have no idea what this bollinger band indicator means for the bitcoin price, basically anytime where we see a decent size squeeze in this indicator, when these bollinger bands squeeze together, that's basically a strong signal telling us that we're about to see a very volatile move coming sometime soon in the bitcoin price
like what we saw in early may, just around the corner was an extremely volatile move
and just like what we saw around a week ago, just around the corner was another extremely volatile move
and the bollinger band indicator itself, unfortunately, does not tell us the direction of that volatile move
instead, we need to pay attention to support and resistance levels in order to determine what direction that extremely volatile move will play out
and once again, what i mentioned in yesterday's video was the fact that the bitcoin price was losing that 28 and a half thousand dollar support level, and will actually forming bearish market structure right here in the shorter term
because as the bitcoin price broke to the downside below 28 and a half thousand, we actually came back up, retested that level and confirmed it as new resistance, which is a very bearish signal
and once again, i mentioned that in yesterday's video, before this crash
but what is very interesting is, despite the bitcoin price playing out a fairly significant crash recently, the bitcoin long positions over on bitflax have actually increased
in fact, if you're looking at what we saw just yesterday and today, we've seen another 16 000 bitcoin getting added to these long positions, which is equivalent to well over 300 million us
and if you take a look at these bitcoin long positions compared to the bitcoin price here on the weekly time frame right now, these long positions are at all time high levels on the bitfenix exchange
so it is definitely worth looking at some other times in the bitcoin price where we've seen these bitcoin long positions on this exchange shoot into new alltime highs
and if you're looking at the last time that happened here on the weekly chart, that was in the middle of last year, more specifically around july 2021
at that stage in the market, these bitcoin long positions on this particular exchange shot into new alltime highs, above the previous alltime higher
and it's really interesting to see how accurate these long positions were because obviously, during that time in the market where these long positions were at alltime highs, betting on the bitcoin price going up, that was basically happening as the bitcoin price was bottoming out, getting ready for its next bullish move
and if you're going back further on the chart, looking at the time before that, where these bitcoin long positions on this exchange were at alltime high levels, that was during december 2019
and at that time in the market, we were at at least a shortterm bottom for bitcoin
and just around the corner was a 60 pump in the bitcoin price, before we obviously experienced that mass 2020 crash
and now getting into the ethereum parts of this video, this right here is the weekly ethereum to your solar chart
and if you're looking at the weekly ethereum rsi, we have now confirmed one weekly kennel close with the rsi under a value of 30, which means oversold
and obviously, ever since we got the weekly kennel close around one day ago, the weekly ethereum rsi has dropped even lower into oversold territories
in fact, right now, at the time of recording in this video, it's sitting at around 27 and a half
and just to put that into perspective, right at the bottom of the 2018 bear market, we saw the weekly ethereum rsi at a value of 2793, so just under 28
so technically speaking, according to the weekly ethereum rsi, right now ethereum is the most oversold it has ever been in its entire history
and now it is important to keep in mind that this right here is not a shortterm signal
this is for the much longer term, talking about multiple months, if not years from now
because once again, even though the weekly ethereum rsi is currently the lowest it's ever been before, we've only seen one weekly candle close in oversold territories at the time of recording this video
and if you're looking at what happened at the end of the 2018 bear market, we actually saw four separate weekly kennel closes in oversold territories
and so basically after that first weekly candle close in oversell territories, we still had another three more weeks before then we hit the bottom for the bear markets
this is really looking at the next few months, at a minimum, but ideally the next few years
and also, what is really interesting is if you're taking a look at the ethereum short positions on the bifidex exchange right now, they have sunken to alltime low levels, which basically means the whales on this exchange, after closing over 300 million dollars worth of ethereum short positions, see very limited downside price action and risk of more upside at price action
because, of course, if you're in a short position, upside price action is the risk
and right now, simply based on these extremely low levels of shorts positions, once again, they see the most amount of risk of more upside price action and very limited downside price action
and in fact, if you look at these ethereum short positions compared to the ethereum price action here on the weekly chart, the previous alltime low in these ethereum short positions was at the very end of 2019, entering into early 2020, just before we experienced a decent pump in the price of ethereum
in fact, that pump in the price of ethereum was around 147 percent when these short positions were at these insanely low levels
and if you're looking at some other times in the market where the short positions were at some very low levels, that was right around september october 2020, as we experienced some shortterm bearish price action, but just before we experienced more bullish price action
and also in this massive correction that we saw in the middle of last year, we saw these short positions at these very low levels
so on top of the fact that ethereum, according to the weekly ethereum rsi, is currently more oversold than it's ever been before, we're also seeing the least amount of whales short ethereum, looking on the bifnx exchange, than we've ever seen before
and considering the fact that here on the six hour ethereum charts, ethereum hit my price target at around 14 k, but relatively surpassed that price targets down towards around 12 k, what are some other levels of support to pay attention to? and well, for that, i'll be looking at our fibonacci retracement tool here on the weekly ethereum chart, drawn from the march 2020 low up to the alltime high for ethereum
and that places the second most important fibonacci level, which is the 382 fibonacci level, at around 11 k approximately
and a very similar thing can be said about ethereum versus bitcoin
here on the weekly chart, we have the 382 fibonacci level coming in at around 0046 bitcoin per ethereum
and so far we've gotten pretty close to that price target that i set a while ago
and right now on the weekly ethereum for spitcoin chart, we are forming a week showing some shortterm bullish pressure
but keep in mind the bearish trend on the larger time frames is still very much intact for ethereum versus bitcoin
so as of right now, when it comes to my personal crypto investing portfolio, i'm certainly heavier into bitcoin compared to ethereum, as i mentioned a long time ago here on the channel publicly
and this is due to the fact that the bitcoin dominance is looking quite strong here on the weekly chart
but right now, in the shorter term, the bitcoin dominance is seeing a bit of a small rejection from this range of resistance, which was sitting at around 48 percent approximately
but keep in mind, the bitcoin dominance played out something very similar to this back around the middle of 2018 during that previous bear markets
but within just a few weeks later, the bitcoin dominance eventually pushed above that range of resistance, which was very bearish compared to old queens versus bitcoin, because bitcoin was reclaiming its dominance over the crypto market
and in case you're new to the crypto world, this type of thing is very normal during a bearish time in the market
it's very normal for alt coins to underperform against bitcoin and for bitcoin to hold up a lot better than the majority of alt coins out there, which is why i'm extremely light on alt coins and heavier into bitcoin
and now talking about what's been happening with celsius, because within the last 24 hours, celsius has actually paused all withdrawals, and also they've paused swaps within their accounts
and straight away, what this tells us is a lot of people have been trying to withdraw their funds from celsius, to the point where either one or two things is potentially happening
either they're low on liquidity and they need to try and sell some of their other assets in order to gather more liquidity to open up withdrawals again, which is the scenario we should all be hoping for
but the other scenario is celsius potentially running low on funds all together, not just low on liquidity
and obviously, it's not like i work at celsius, so unfortunately i don't have any inside information
but if you do a little bit more digging, beyond the fact that people are just trying to withdraw funds from celsius and they might be low on liquidity, another couple of reasons that could potentially prove to be some major issues for celsius moving forward is that, first of all, celsius potentially own a lot of liquid staked ethereum
and you might be wondering, what is that? and basically, it's a liquid version of staked ethereum
because even though ethereum is still proof of work as of right now and not proof of stake, you can still actually stake your ethereum under the eth 20 contract
but if you do that, you essentially lock up that ethereum until the ethereum merge happens, merging ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake, also known as ethereum 20
but then there's what's called a liquid state ethereum, which is basically an ethereum contract that acts as if it states ethereum, but instead it's, of course, liquid, so you can move it around
and that liquid staked ethereum contract is meant to have a onetoone peg to the price of ethereum
but recently, if you're looking at this one to one peg for liquid staked ethereum versus the price of ethereum, over the past few days, it has been beginning to lose its onetoone peg
and in fact, right now, at the time of recording in this video, one liquid staked ethereum is currently worth 096 ethereum
so basically, if someone had, let's just say, a hundred thousand ethereum, and wanted to have that in liquid staked ethereum to earn some of that interest, then right now, at current valuations, that liquid staked ethereum would be worth only around 96 000 ethereum, which is, of course, a 4 000 ethereum loss in that scenario, based on this onetoone peg being lost
so if celsius does actually hold a lot of liquid staked ethereum and this peg gets even worse, then that is not good for celsius
and also another potential issue for celsius is their massive oasis vault loan, which is basically a loan celsius has
dollars worth of wrapped bitcoin locked up as collateral in this loan
and their liquidation price for this half a billion dollars worth of wrapped bitcoin is only at around 183 k
and now earlier, before they locked withdrawals, this was actually at a higher liquidation price
but then what happened is celsius stopped all withdrawals and then started adding tens of millions of dollars worth of wrapped bitcoin into this collateral to lower their liquidation price
but of course, this comes at a cost, because in order to lower that liquidation price, you need to add more and more collateral to this loan
so basically, if we see the bitcoin price keep on dropping lower and lower, then expect celsius to try and add more and more collateral to this loan in order to continue to lower this liquidation price
and it's very likely that, while this is happening, withdrawals would most likely stay close
but then if we see a good recovery in the bitcoin price back to the upside, celsius, in that case, could afford to take some money back out of this loan and raise that liquidation price if the bitcoin price goes up
and of course, in that case that would have more liquidity to support more withdrawals and potentially open up withdrawals again

i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
now, as i'm sure all of you are aware, the bitcoin price has started to massively cascade today on the opening on monday
we are coming down to 22 900 as of the time of recording this
and because we've had this cascade, we've now come down and filled our second cme gap
the last time i talked about the cme gaps, we highlighted there were three cme gaps in the bitcoin price, one being at the ranges of 33 000, correlating to the price gap back here in the 23rd of july
the second cme gap at 24 600, correlating to the price gap uh around the 28th of december 2020
and the third and final price gap over on the cme is down here at 18 500, correlating to the price gap around the 11th of december 2020
so if you're new and you haven't heard of the cme gaps before, let me just quickly explain
the cme is referred to the chicago mercantile exchange, and they run what are known as futures markets
this is basically the stock market equivalent of buying bitcoin
and as i'm sure all of you are aware the stock markets run monday to friday, and they do not run on saturday and sunday
contrast to that, bitcoin runs monday to sunday 365 days a year, and it never shuts so because of this, when we chart the bitcoin usd price over on the cme futures, you can see that we have these price gaps
why do we have a price gap? because the bitcoin price continued to capitulate over the weekend
because of this, we opened the markets over on the cme futures today on the 13th of june, at 27 400
when we closed the futures markets at 28 900 over the weekend
so just hypothetically, we now have a new cme gap, and it is above us at 28 960
so why do we care? why do we talk about cme gaps? well typically, the price is always magnetized back to the cme gaps
now when you zoom in, you can see there was a price gap right here at 54 000
what did we do? the price went on a run, and as you can see, it came right back down and filled the price gap
but what happened while we were on the run up? we actually had another price gap
you can see there was a price gap between the ranges of fifty eight thousand, nine hundred and basically sixty thousand
what happened because of this? well, the price came up and we broke back down, and once again, we filled another of those cme gaps
you can see we have a cme gap between the ranges of 61 900 down here to 57 100
and we pumped up, and we didn't quite fill it until we broke back above later on the year and filled the cme gap
when you do look at the bitcoin chart, we predominantly, always fill these cme gaps
we do not fill every cme gap, but the price is normally magnetized to these cme gaps because the price likes to come back to where it closed over on the weekend
what does this mean for the bitcoin price? well, we are now currently in a dilemma, because we are faced between two cme gaps
let me mark these as orange so we can distinguish between the ones that have previously been hit and the ones that we should be focusing on at this moment in time
now we have two cme gaps, one down here at 18 500, that we had all the way back here in december of 2020
and in my opinion, i do think it is fairly likely that we would come back down and fill this price gap
just like i also feel like it would be likely for us, not only to fill this price gap, but to at some point come up to 29 000 and fill the cme gap
i believe, in my opinion, that bitcoins going to millions of dollars in my lifetime
obviously, not in the next week, during the next month, not in the next couple of years
but i do think obviously bitcoin is going to come back to 29 000 at some point in time and fill the cme gap
so this is really just a quick video to let you know that we have filled the next cme gap, being the cme gap at 24 600
so if we do come down to the next cme gap, which, in my opinion, i do think is not a likelihood, i think it's an inevitability
almost all of them have a, have they have about a 99 likelihood of getting filled
this would represent a 203 drop in the bitcoin price before we do come down to the next cme
all right, quick update on the bitcoin longs and the bitcoin short so the longs are going to the moon, and the shorts have been rejected from a key area of support, slash resistance
at this moment in time, you can see the shorts have come up to my number one support resistance box
and i've highlighted this before in multiple videos where i have talked about these shorts
now why this is such an important range is because you can see, since the epoch commencing 2019, we've basically been either above or below this
and you can see that this is a key pivotal point where either the shorts get above this and we go on a massive rally
if the shorts normally do start running up above this range, you can start to see that we have 288 increases in the shorts
and on the flip side, you can see when the price comes into this resistance range and gets a rejection, the shorts dropped by subsequently 80 or in this area, you know, we dropped, we dropped about 86 percent
we came back up into it, had a wick back above it, and on the weekly time frame, got massively pushed down, had about another another 82 drop
now, i'm not gonna measure all of them, you can kind of see my point that, you know, you run up into these zones, you get a big rejection
if you don't get above the top of these, you run up exactly to the top of this don't get back above it on the weekly daily time frame, massive rejection
and at this point in time, in this weekly time frame, the shorts tried to have a massive, massive run up
they came up to the top of this support slash resistance zone, clearly flipped resistance once again
well, to be honest, this zone has been resistance since july of 2021
and at this moment in time, once again, we've had another rejection, and the longs are stealing the cake from the bitcoin shorts
what do i mean by this? well, look at the bitcoin longs at this moment in time
they've been going on new alltime highs for quite some period of time now, approximately the past two months, it's been on a massive, massive rally
you can see the previous alltime highs for longs were sitting around july of 2021
and at this moment in time, they've almost doubled up to a hundred and seven thousand
if we look at this day over day, you can really see the longs have been on a massive rally
now how is this even possible? because if we look at this date range, for the past 65 days, the longs have increased over 175 percent
with that being said, since the longs have been increasing during this period in time, if we come over to the btc usd price, ignoring the elliott wave, simply focusing on the move down in the chart, what you'll notice is, since the longs have been starting to fire to the upside, the price has moved down 45 to 46, meaning that if these people are using, you know, 2x leverage, they should be liquidated on some of their position, unless they're increasing their margin within the next five percent drop to the downside, which would represent a liquidation price of around twenty one thousand two hundred
now, speaking of liquidations, michael saylor is also coming into a mass capitulation over on his uh over, on his bitcoin trades
the last time i checked, two days ago, he was at 300 million in a loss, and in the past two days we've massively cascaded
so i imagine michael sailor uh may be coming to liquidate some of his crypto
slightly off topic, i did just want to make that as a separate point
nonetheless, here is my theory on what is going on on the bitcoin longs
because, in my opinion, i do not think this is a multitude of retail traders
i think we're coming to the point in the cycle where most retail traders are running out of money, uh? because i've noticed on my channel, at least in the past couple of months, everyone has been saying, nonstop, buy the dip
and i witnessed the exact same thing when i was in the 2018 bear market
and what happened was commencing the end of the bear market, or should i say, commencing the start of the ball run coming into the end of the bear market
i saw all over my socials, everyone was saying, online, i have no more money, uh? and that moment in time where everyone lost complete faith in the markets, when no one had any more money to buy the dip, when no one could go long, no one had, you know, the the capital to make any trades, that was when the exact bottom was in
but people are still buying the dip, and the longs are still going up at this period in time
now, you might be thinking, the longs going up is good for the bitcoin price
and it really depends on what type of market scenario you're in
but if we plot the btc usd price, oops, if we plot the btc usd price over the bitcoin longs, what you'll notice is, at this moment in time, they're actually inversely correlated
well, if we zoom out, what you'll notice is, this is the bitcoin price
and if you look at the downside down here, we can see the, if i make this full screen, actually, you can see, once again, the bitcoin longs
the bitcoin price starts to massively, massively run to the downside
what's happening with the bitcoin longs? while this is happening, bitcoin longs are running to the upside
what do you notice once the bitcoin price bottoms down here, bitcoin price goes on a massive run to the upside
while the bitcoin price bottoms the longs start losing momentum, and, you know, people stop longing, or people get liquidated
well, you know, people don't get liquidated, but less people are longing per se
when you look at the bitcoin price as well, all the way up here, you can see massive, massive cascade in terms of the bitcoin price
now, we had a dead cat bounce to the downside and then back to the upside, just like we had right here
but what you'll notice is the macro move, bitcoin price moves down
and from this approximate range, yes, we went down temporarily, but the lungs started to massively, massively run up to the upside
so you can very much tell the lungs in the macro time frames are oftenly, are often diverged from the bitcoin price
and once again, we're seeing a massive, massive divergence in the bitcoin long so what i'll be looking at is, hopefully, at some point in time, seeing the longs start to run to the downside
now, this would typically mean that whales have, you know, made their money, and they would be entering, uh, into spot positions because they've made large amounts of uh, large amounts of profit over in the, you know, the futures markets, wherever they're trading, uh, whatever they're leveraging their btc usd prices on
btc price going on a massive run to the downside, and the longs are massively diverging and running to the upside
so the bitcoin longs is going to be another metric for us to quantify how the bitcoin price is likely to react
and in my opinion, once we start seeing moves to the downside over on the bitcoin price, uh, sorry, once we start seeing runs to the downside on the bitcoin longs, we should start to see the price recover slightly
now, i do have one theory that i did want to share about the bitcoin longs before we do wrap up the video, and that is the fact that i believe this is not retail traders doing these longs
now, why do i think this is not a bunch of retail traders making this long as well, i'm of the opinion that this is a pod of whales, or this is a multitude of different pods of whales
but nonetheless, what you'll notice is, once again, like we said, the past two months or so, bitcoin longs have been running to the upside
and as such, retail traders look for ways to make lucrative money
and as such, they use 10x leverage, 25x leverage, 100x leverage
now, sometimes when whales want to manipulate the market, they will hot they'll do high leverage buyers or cells when we're coming into a key area of support resistance
but while we're massively cascading in a trend, you know, the train is your friend till the end, i imagine they would be using lower leverage
and as such, a 2x should be more than good enough for them to make a large amount of profit
like i said, the price has moved down more than 45, coming up to 46
so if this was retail traders using 10x leverage, the long should have been wiped out already
if it is wales using 2x leverage, or even less than 2x leverage, then the liquidation price might be coming in very, very soon
so keep your eyes on the bitcoin longs if they do start to head to the downside
and also, you notice that shorts are starting to drop to the downside as well, then, in my opinion, that should be a pretty good signal, uh, that we have flushed out the majority of leveraged traders, and it is time to jump back into spot positions
that is all i've got for you today over on the bitcoin longs of the bitcoin shorts
so what the hell is happening in the bitcoin price? we're down 11 today, and we're already coming down to one of my macro price targets
this is what i want to talk about in this video, i'm going to be quick firing between different charts because i want to give you a range of perspectives
i want to talk about where the elliott wave theory predicts the bottom is going to be for bitcoin
i want to talk about the bitcoin dominance and how this is likely to affect bitcoin and the old cranes
i'm going to be moving on to some of my macro charts, talking about moving averages, previous alltime highs
we're going to be looking at how bitcoin is performing when accounting for the money supply, and how this is previously reacted
once we do come down to these levels, we're going to wrap things up talking about the dollar and the stock market
so like i said, i want to provide you with a large array of perspectives in today's video
i'm just going to spend a minute on this because i provided an indepth perspective on this yesterday
i'm going to wait to talk about the momentum indicators and the volume until we hop over to some of our macro charts
typically we always bottom between the one wave and the three wave
your first or your one impulse, is up here, and your three impulses up here
now obviously we cannot bottom higher than we already are at this moment in time
so according to elliott wave theory, the bottom should be anywhere between the levels we're at now, which is 23 000, all the way down to your one wave back down here at 14 000
i don't think we're going to be coming anywhere near that range
so i'd say, in my opinion, if we were going to have a traditional elliott wave bottom, i'd say we'd bottom between the free wave and the one wave, probably very, very close to the 19 to 20 000
so if we come into the lower time frames, you can see since our macro five wave on the elliott wave theory, so we had our free impulse, five impulse, and now we are in our macro correctory a, b, c, within these correctory waves
when you are in these bearish impulses, the downside, you impulse in three bearish waves
so you have your one bearish impulse, your three bearish impulse and your five bearish impulse
we've already had your one correctory wave to two, three correctory wave to four, and at this moment in time, we are sitting in the five wave
so yes, i know the markets are absolutely getting decimated right now
but i am of the opinion that the bottom is getting very, very close
on my channel, i've actually been bearish for the past, i've been bearish for at least the past six weeks
if you head over to my twitter at 618 underscore cowboy, if you look at any of the videos i've done in the past six weeks, i refuse to compromise my integrity
i told you that we were going lower, and that is what we're seeing right now
a lot of people are getting extremely bearish while we're in this phase
but at this moment in time, i'm getting more bullish on bitcoin than i've been in the past couple of years, because i do think the bottom is at least gonna be close in terms of date terms
i do think we can get battered pretty hard in terms of price within the next month or two though
so with that being said, uh, if we're looking at the five wave on the eliot wave theory
in my opinion, the bottom should be around about this, 20 000
i'm going to leave the bitcoin dominance until a little bit later
i want to talk about the fact that in this macro chart that we previously talked about, we did break down from this massive, massive ascending triangle
if we extrapolate the price target of this, it seems like today we've already come down and hit the price target on the head
and if we look at the volume, i want to specifically look at some of the volume on the exchanges right now
over on kraken, 88 000 bitcoin has been, uh, troll uh, has been traded and predominantly sold in the past, uh, daily candle
and you know, if we come over to the four hour you can see this has predominantly been in the past 12 hours
if we look at the squeeze, one as well, i've been warning you about this as well, the squeeze one
if you're new to the channel, this is our momentum indicator of choice
and when was the last time the squeeze bomb had a trend shift? well, we were moving from this, uh, dark red phase, indicative that bears were either taking a break or losing control
we shifted over into light green when we had our impulse to the top of the ema ribbons
this is such a powerful indicator on the daily and higher time frames
thirty one thousand one hundred is when we shifted bearish over on the squeeze mom and currently, at this moment in time, we're approximately 24 percent down since the momentum shift
i would also like to highlight, you know, a lot of people think the bottom is going to be very, very near
a lot of people have been saying the bottom has been in for months i've been obviously a contrarian trader
people, you know, that they were hating on me when i said solano was going to 25
people hated on me when i said strong was going to zero, when it was at 270
people left comments saying, you know, in my dreams, kadena's going to one dollar
so the point of my channel is not to try and get everyone to like me
i would, i'd much rather have a high level of integrity and maintain my opinions and tell you how it is, rather than just say, guys, the bottom is in
because, you know, if i was a moonboy, i could have loaded up this chart and been like, look, we're coming down to the 200 week moving average every other time
this is not going to play out exactly as it did in previous cycles
let's head over to some of our other charts, like uh binance and buy bit, which are obviously known for leverage trading, so there's going to be high amounts of volume over on there
over on finance, 148 000 bitcoin has been sold in the daily time frame
the last time we saw something like this, we were heading down, uh, to 29 000
we lolly gagged for a prolonged period of time, and then we start to leg down
i would also like to highlight, a lot of the time, when you get these mass, mass fear candles, like if we look, you can see mass sphere candle right here
i have to emphasize that, not the macro time frame, the local time frame
we dumped into the price, lowly gagged for a couple of weeks, broke down, large amount of volume
we broke down into the price, lowly gagged for a couple of weeks
and then we continued to break down, large amount of volume coming in
right here, we broke down, lollygagged for at least a week, and then had a fake out, and then broke back down, large amount of volume coming in
over on the 19th of may, we broke down into the price, lollygagged for a very, very long period of time before coming back up
so i do think, at least somewhat in the local term, that the bottom for bitcoin is in
and once again, i have to emphasize this because, you know, i know some people might not differentiate between the local tops and the macro bottoms
a local top is where the price, uh, or a local top, or a local bottom, is where the price temporarily tops or bottoms in the lower time frames
once we capitulated all the way down here, this was your local bottom
before we broke back down that local bottom, this is an alltime high
and then if we come back, come back to the bear markets, this is an alltime low
i really do want people to, uh, to understand my perspective on this, that i do think the bottom in the local term, if it hasn't already printed, it is probably printing very, very soon
i find it hard to believe that bitcoin is going to massively cascade much more at this moment in time
we're probably going to pump into the fomc meeting, which is on the 15th, by the way
i would also like to state the chicago mercantile exchange, which is the cme group, predicts a hundred percent likelihood of a incr, of an increase in the interest rates
now, if you're a veteran to my channel, you already know i've talked about the, uh, the increase in the interest rates
the last time we had an increase was on the 4th of may, right here
we pumped into the price, which is what i have been predicting
i have been saying, i do think we're probably likely to rally on the day of the fomc meeting
but what soon ensued? you know, i'm not even going to draw it down to this low, but within literally a week, two weeks or so, we came down 33 percent
and i do think we're setting up for something like that again
if the fed increases the interest rates by 50 basis points, which i think they are at least going to increase the interest rates by 50 basis points, then we're probably going to massively, massively capitulate the day or the day after that day
so at this moment in time, jerome powell, which is the chairman, has been saying that he is going to keep on increasing the in interest rates by 50 basis points, month over month over month
he specifically said they are not going to stop until the fed sees science the inflation is becoming transitory, and it's going to shift over into a phase where inflation is not high and rampant
at this moment in time, literally a week ago, we just got news that the cpi, the consumer price index, shot up to 86 percent year to date
that was an increase of of one percent from the previous month
that is the complete opposite of what jerome powell said he would need to see to stop increasing the interest rates
because of this, i think it's highly likely that we're at least going to see a 50 basis point increase
but i've actually been seeing, uh, i've been, you know, talking to some people and talking to some people that are within this um, within this group, and i'm i'm very, very confident that we potentially might be seeing higher than a 50 basis point increase
i think it'd be more likely we shift over into a 70 basis point increase, which would probably probably allow bitcoin to have a massive, massive capitulation
so we talked about the volume over on binance, 150 000 traded today
let's look at some of the other charts before we do shift over into another chart
i'm trying to get a lot of information condensed into one video
i know people appreciate these, uh, shorter videos rather than longer videos
so if you if i'm, if i'm talking too fast, you can always, uh, change the speed of the video to 075
or you can just scroll back 15 seconds if you missed something that i said
but let's look at some other exchanges before we do move over
when you look at finance and buybit and and all that, you're basically looking at predominantly leveraged traders, you know, people leveraging bitcoin
but all of these, kraken, we already mentioned kraken um, bitfinex volume, one bit for next is not loading in
big crane shorts are currently running rampant at this moment in time
uh, the lungs, i believe, the longs, are also breaking into new alltime highs, but predominantly the shorts are
if these are increasing, then it's not going to be looking good for the price
now, i've highlighted this before, but the moonlight for the shorts is this level right here, 5057
if we do pump above this approximate level at the top of this box, we're likely to go on a massive, massive rally
why is that? well, look at what happened the last, uh, the last couple of times we spike
long's increased by 297 after pushing up from this box here, long's increased by 295
so from here, once we broke out, 120 percent increase in the shorts here, once we broke out, 425 increase in the shorts
and if you do not close daily and weekly candles, because predominantly these moves are witnessed in lower time frames, which is why, you know, when you shift over to the weekly you notice, you know, sometimes we have these wicks above because it's very most of the time, what happens with these shorts is they wick above and they get pushed back down very, very quickly
you can see that the most amount of time we spent pushing up on these shorts was one, two, three, four, five weeks
and bear in mind, you know, this could have been half the week down here
we really don't spend too long above this neckline in the shorts
however, what i would like to say on this is that if we do push back above, we're very, very likely to start cascading
another super bearish thing we're seeing is the fact that michael saylor's trade on bitcoin is now down 330 million
what has been happening in the past two days for the bitcoin price? what we look at the daily we've gone down 15 and a half percent
so i talked about this before, michael saylor has a margin call
and if we do keep on cascading, michael saylor and microstrategy are going to have to liquidate some of their bitcoin
why are they going to have to liquidate some of their bitcoin? because they purchase that bitcoin using debt
and they can't afford for the price of bitcoin to go down, because if they can't pay off their debt, they're obviously going to be absolutely screwed
let's move over to some of our macro charts, and then i'm going to wrap up with the stock market
if we look at this macro chart that we're running off, i talked about this ages ago, you know, we were predicting this massive move down to 23 000 when we were literally sitting at about 34 000
if we look at the market structure, i, you know, if, once again, if you're a seasoned veteran to my channel, you will recognize this chart, because i've been looking at this for for months now
previously, the previous bear market, we had this descending triangle pattern
we were consolidating, consolidating, and then once you broke down, you had that massive, massive cascade
what are we seeing right now over on the bitcoin price? descending triangle, breakdown, massive cascade
so i do not really expect us to keep on going down, you know, month after month after month
i do think that we're at least going to find a local bottom very, very soon
i think we are coming down to the 200 week moving average, which, at this moment in time, if we were to come down to this on the weekly time frame, which is looking more and more likely, the 200 week would be coming in at an approximate valuation of 22 400, which represents about another five to six percent drop to the downside, which, as you can imagine, really wouldn't be too much after what we've seen today
why do i think we're coming down to the 200 week? well, if we look back to previous market structures, let's go back to the 2015 bear market
what do you notice if we extrapolate this 200 week back just another couple of weeks? because bear in mind, this wouldn't have loaded it at this point, because it is the 200 week moving average
so if we take this back here, you can see the 200 week doesn't load in until we obviously have 200 weeks worth of data traded
but if we switch this over to 190 week, or something of that approximate valuation, you would see that we pretty much did hold, uh, all of the candle body closes
and we even back tested at a higher valuation, march 2020 pandemic scale
where did we come down to? yes, we whipped back down to the lows of this um, this support and resistance range
however, the candle body close was exactly on the 200 week moving average
you can see we broke down, went all the way down here, pumped back up
counter body closed was on the 200 week, broke back down, made a higher low, came back up
candle body close was just above the 200 week, and then we started going on a rally once we held it
so while i would like to emphasize, uh, the geopolitical state of the economy is much, much different than it was in 2018
we didn't have 86 cpi, and we didn't have biden running america
so typically this is not a good sign, when you see oil ramping up
so oil is typically not something that i cover on this channel, but it is something to note because it does massively, massively affect the state of the economy, and thus how much money could flow into the stock market, how much money will flow into crypto, and subsequently, whether we're in a riskon or riskoff environment
i've been saying this for the past month or two, but we are in a riskoff environment
a lot of people disagreed with me a month or two ago when i made videos saying, bitcoin, we've now broken into a bear market, but we're coming into fruition
the point of bear markets is typically you do not realize you're in a bear market until they're almost done
so i would really like to emphasize, yes, we are in a bear market
do i think that we're going to be going down for the next couple of years? absolutely not
like i said, you know back here, because i was in this market structure in 2018
um, people still did not believe we were in a bear market after the first, uh, first week down
they only believed we were in a bear market after we had this massive, massive capitulation
that's once it finally started getting through to people's heads we were in a bear market
and at this moment in time, this massive wick cast, this massive candle body that pushed to the downside, is very, very similar to what we're witnessing at this moment in time
a lot of people say, you know, um, expect the market cycles to be different
however, at this moment in time, we do need to recognize the 20132017 bull run was approximately four years
this represents an approximate deviation of about 40 to 50 days within this cycle
so once again, another fouryear cycle that panned out to the teeth
however, like i said, the state of the economy is a lot worse than it was back then
so like i said on this chart, 200 week moving average would be predicting a bottom round about 22 000
but what happens when we quantify bitcoin against the money supply? so once again, if you're new to my channel one, welcome
but this chart, because you may have not seen this before, i don't know anyone who does this
now you might be wondering, why would we divide by the m2 money supply? well, the m2 money supply is basically a measure of readily available cash
this constitutes things like cash, checking deposits, bank balances and close and easily convertible assets, easily convertible commodities, easily convertible cash, basically
another way of saying what the m2 money supply is is say, for example, if there's an increase in stimulus checks, which there was last year, then obviously the amount of monetary money, the amount of money that will be in people's checking accounts and people savings accounts, will increase
so when the m2 money supply increases, it typically means that there's an increase in the supply of money within the economy, specifically the us
now what happens when we thus divide bitcoin by the m2 money supply? well, we are accounting for inflation
because if we divide bitcoin usd by the m2, then we're saying this is what bitcoin would look like if there was never any inflation
and something we were all we are approximately 22 above the previous alltime high
what happens if we look at uh, if there was no money supply, or if there was no increase in the money supply, with 21 percent down, which represents about a 25 plus 21, also about a 46 to 50 percent deviation between these two charts? what's another way of saying this when we account for the money supply, the price is about 50 percent, uh, more towards the downside
the reason for this is because there was an increase in the money supply, because lots of people got air dropped, free stemies, free stimulus checks, whatever
and if you look at the day when these stimulus checks came out, people were buying, you know, one thousand dollars, one thousand two hundred dollars worth of bitcoin, just like that
so that shows how an increase in the money supply can drastically move the price of assets, commodities, and most importantly, bitcoin, up
when we do quantify against the m2 money supply, we're already down at the 200 week and i would like to highlight, in previous ranges, we do not capitulate more than 35 over here, 35 over here
so if we were to have another drop, bear in mind, this is an index chart
this does not represent the price chart, because we are dividing by the m2
this is an index and because of this, we do not have an exact value associated with the drop
however, if we do look this would represent about a 33 drop when accounting for the money supply
so if we were to extrapolate a 33 drop over on the bitcoin price, which i'm not necessarily predicting, this would take us down to fifteen to sixteen thousand
that price target is very, very similar to the elliott wave count
if we do come down to the one wave, which is round about fourteen thousand
but i specifically said i believe we would bottom somewhere between the one and the three waves
so this would be, uh, in perfect confluence with elliott wave theory
if we did have our bottom, and then we could start our next bounce
potentially, i think we'd be coming up to 40 000 for the net for the first bounce, then our two wave, probably coming back down to 19 000
you know, you can start seeing these big, big increases free wave
this is just a rough drawing, but something like this is what i see panning out
what happens after then, we will have to see, uh, you know, judging based on how the economy is running at that moment in time
now, to wrap up the video, we've talked about bitcoin against the m2 money supply
we've talked about bitcoin areas to bounce based on previous alltime highs
we've talked about, uh, or, you know, actually, we haven't talked about bitcoin dominance
i all i want to say about the bitcoin dominance is because i do make separate, uh, much more indepth videos about this
it seems like we're coming back down and back testing the breakout
now, you know, bear in mind, it does not matter what happens day over day
the bitcoin dominance is a macro chart, and we've just broken out of a huge, huge macro pattern
if bitcoin comes back to 477 percent, uh, 473, or even roundabout 47, where the moving averages on the daily are, and then we start to push back up, once again, i am warning you, you are going to see ult cranes get absolutely decimated
let's move on and wrap up the video with what is going on in the dollar and the stock market
and we're already coming back up to the local high, or, you know, the alltime high for this cycle
i pointed back to previous examples where we've seen this before on the dollar
i said, you know, until the door starts macro capitulating, don't, don't count out, because we've done this before
everyone fought we were cascading to hell, and then we bounced back up stronger than ever
and i do believe in this economy, in a riskoff economy, the dollar is the king
if you look at you know how much a dollar can buy in the past, you know, 50, 100 years or so, you'll see that it, ha, it has already dropped 99
so i expect it to drop another 99 over the next decade, and then another 99, and then another 99, until everything's probably priced in something else, or satoshi's
with that being said, if the dollar keeps on heading up, you are going to see the stock market get wrecked
so the dollar's going up, right? i said the stock market's probably going to get wrecked
the stock market is about to open its premarket at 381 um, representing a drop from its diamond top down seven percent
uh, well, at this moment in time, obviously, the stock market is not open
we're waiting for the market to open, hence the premarket over here
if we do get a massive influx of volume coming in, bearish volume, like we did see on friday, this is going to massively, massively mess things up
however, i would not be surprised if we come back down to the previous alltime high at 19 000
i would not be surprised if we temporarily worked below it, maybe come down to 16 000
but yeah, that is basically what i see coming into fruition for bitcoin
i do expect lower price targets are going to be coming in very, very soon
i do also expect that a local bottom is going to present itself within the next couple of weeks or so
the bitcoin dominance is clearly king right now, and bitcoin is very likely to outperform all the upgrades
hope you found some value in looking at a range of different perspectives
let's analyze the situation for bitcoin, because it looks like it has no time to lose, and it wants to go lower and lower without any relief rally
and i want to explain the situation, because yesterday we were having a look at bitcoin at this major range, okay? was losing the 28 600, having a little push to the downside, consolidating beneath this major support level, turning into resistance
if we zoom in here on the one hourly chart, we can see it much better
okay? a major, major level that we have been talking about, right for the last few days
the value area low from the volume traded for the last, you know, month, 30, 31 days since we had that drop
i will be looking for some trading opportunities by monday, by tomorrow
all right, so i haven't been trading bitcoin for the last, you know, four or five days, um, but you know, we, we this kind of price action to the, to the downside was very, very likely
why? because we, you know, we did see this as a redistribution kind of event where we did have this spring point over here, a little bit of bullish momentum, okay, but it's only, these are only, you know, bullish traps, okay? and you can see it clearly here
this is what usually happens when you have a major consolidation
most of the people at this range think that you're going to roll back down and retest
but first of all, you do create a kind of an abc correction, right? from this big, massive correction over here, you create this a right over here, the b, and then the c, and then you continue back down to retest the wick
okay? if you're looking at elliott wave counts and the abc corrections
and of course, once you start correcting from this range, and you create a bearish pattern, which is a descending triangle, okay? you can see the bearish pressure here, creating lower highs and a pretty solid base at the 29 300
we did have a strong base bouncing consistently here in june, as you can see, the 2nd of june, the the 4th of june, the 7th of june, getting a bounce at this same level and creating lower highs
of course, this street descending triangle could have been longer, you know
but we managed to, you know, we broke out when we formed about 70, 60, 70 percent of the of the pattern
we had solid levels here, as you can see, uh, solid, big candles
we got rejected perfectly from this major support level i'm talking about, the 29 300, and we got rejected
that was a pretty nice short trade, because you did break out here
as you can see, it was a pretty solid, one hourly, even four hourly candle
you know, you did break down, you know, quite low, you know, from this level
so that was, you know, um, yeah, over a four five hundred dollar drop
so going back to the one hourly chart, going back to the one hourly, we can see, all right, that we have, or we did, break a major support level again yesterday
it was kind of tricky because it was a little bit of a consolidation, but it was finally a major breakout
this was the moment that i was bullish from this range, looking for that, you know, looking for that c correction to the upside, to the 32 000
and now, of course, after having that c correction, you know, we are very likely going to come down and retest the lows, you know, 25, 26 000
and the reason why we are dropping fast here, that was very much explained also yesterday
you know, once we solidly break below this twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, you know, the reason why we are going to drop pretty pretty fast, okay, and have some pretty, um, aggressive, bearish momentum
is because we lost the value area low from the volume trader the last 30 days, which is this area over here, as you can see, after this range, okay, here's where you have a big, big mountain going to the 29 000 range
so this is why, you know, basically, this is the strongest level
once you've lost this level, there's twenty thousand six hundred dollars, you're going to see some pretty pretty aggressive moves to the downside
by next week, of course, it is going to be very, very, very likely that we'll be retesting the 25 000, 26 000 range
now, i was expecting, you know, weekends to be a little bit more boring
but as we do not have hardly any volume, looking at the volume profile, this is why we've had this aggressive drop by, you know, early this morning
no, this was late last year, early, early this morning, late last night, we started dropping aggressively
we either consolidate and go to the downside, or if we do have a quick pump here to the upside, back to this 29 300
that would have been a really nice opportunity for a potential short this is a very, very strong level, and very likely was going to have a continuation to the downside
but what happened is that we actually consolidated and we continued back down
okay, would not definitely, but you know, 80 percent of, you know, chances that we are going to come continue to the downside
what is happening right now? we're having a very, very tiny relief rally
of course, it's clear that the bears are in absolute control from this trend
so what would be the ideal scenario right over here, is getting a retracement
so where would we where would we be looking for that retracement? at least, you know, to retest this trend line, for example
okay, because, uh, continuation to the downside is very, very likely gonna go, instead of going parabolic, it's gonna go parabolic to the downside
okay? you can see this trend already getting more aggressive and more aggressive, creating more aggressive lower highs
so potentially we are going to create another aggressive lower high, and it's going to go pretty, pretty, um, nasty to the downside, uh, until we get to that 25 000 range, the lows that we did create here on the 12th of may
so if we did have the chance, okay, and maybe a lot of people are, of you are not in in any trades, okay, waiting patiently for big retracements to get into a short position
so you know, what would be a good level if we did have that bounce back up? well, i can tell you already, right over here, we've been looking for this trend line over here, these aggressive lower highs
as you can see, if the price action would manage to come all the way up here to around about the 28 000 in the coming hours, it will be, very likely be a good, shining opportunity
so we got a trend line over here with these aggressive lower highs
we've also got a major stop here at this level, which is at the in between the 28 000 and the 28 200
so you do have a spotlight, you you do have a level here where you have stopped
okay? if we were to come up there in the next coming hours, if it is going to come up there in the next coming hours, then, you know, we've already got quite a bit of confluence
you've got this major trend line that's been very much respected, as you can see here
we got very nicely respected yesterday night, you know, getting that consolidation, and then finally this major drop, getting that rejection from this trend line, okay, from these lower highs
now, we've also created here one stop, like i said, in between 2828 and 282
and also we will be, we would be taking a look at fib levels, right this fibonacci retracement over here, we only hit round about the 382, okay? from this drop
okay? we actually hit the 50 here, to perfection 50, from this major drop, as you can see, from here to here, we did bounce all the way up to that 50 fibonacci retracement, right? getting that rejection from this 286
so we've got the daily level, 50 fibonacci, you know, and then this major trend line that, until we got to the trend line, is where we started dropping, as you can see here on the chart
okay? we started dropping as soon as we touched the trend line here, and then had that pretty aggressive move to the downside
and we do have a potential retest of the two of the, of the lows of the 12th of may
okay? it's going to that direction, and it has a level that needs to be retested
it could take, you know, till the end of next week, where we might have some pretty, um, harsh relief rallies
because i do know for a fact that there are a lot of aggressive shorts with high leverage trying to catch this major drop
so you need to be careful with these potential big pumps, these short squeezers, because they will happen
okay? don't feel that you missed out, because there's opportunities every single day
and like i said, okay, we'll be taking a look at fibonacci retracement from this level
i want to really connect to the community, but i want to show you, you know, that the potential opportunities, these opportunities that they are
okay, so maybe people are, you know, i had people asking me in the telegram, are you in a short and i said, no, i haven't been trading for the last few days because i've made insane couple of weeks of trading
and i just thought, right i'm just not, i'm not gonna take a look at you
you need to have your levels marked and, um, yeah, like i just want to show you here, right taking a look at the fibonacci retracement
all right, this is a good level to take a fib fibonacci retracement to see, you know, what levels are important here, because this has been one whole impulse
we've been consolidating here for several hours, and then we had the impulsive move to the downside
so where can we retrace to? of course, we are looking at the 50, 618 fibonacci retracement from these highs to the lows
and, i mean, this would be absolutely magical if we were to retrace all the way to the 618, or to the 50, right in between today and tomorrow
if we do have today, having that nice run up to the 50 618 level, talk
i'm talking about the 26, that 27, 940, which would be the 50 and the 28 100, approximately
you're hitting that 50 618 fibonacci retracement from the impulse to the downside
you're getting the trend line here from these aggressive lower highs, that would very likely be respected, very likely be respected for that continuation to the downside
let's just go with the trend, because the trend is our friend
and that would be a major, major level here for a potential short amin, aiming to retest the shorts, of course, to re retest here, the the low levels at 271 that we just retested a few hours ago
so that would be the ideal scenario here, looking for that major wick consolidation at this range, and having that, you know, another aggressive move to the downside
confluence number two, you have the um, the, uh, the aggressive lower high trend line
you got six, one eight fibonacci retracement that would be at those levels in the next coming hours, you know, that let's see if we're gonna manage to do that, because it might just consolidate sideways and continue down
if we do come all the way up here, then i will be looking for that potential shorting opportunity
you know, would be above this range, above at least the seven, eight from this impulse
a little bit further up, around about this level, above this consolidation at the 287, 286, that we do have a very, very strong range
i don't think price action will manage to get above that level
that would be, that would be my trading opportunity right there
i'm just gonna ask one thing for you guys to do, and is to absolutely destroy that like button here for this sunday live stream, early here
should be getting that kind of rejection in the next coming hours, if we were to come all the way up here
if you haven't joined my team for the bibit competition, make sure to do so

let me just go through the super chat, and then i'm going to go read really, really quickly through the comment section and take a look at a couple of alt coins
will you please have a fresh look at waves for short term? is it good to take along at 57 with target nine, ten dollars? well, this is the thing
yesterday, on yesterday's live stream, i'm not sure if it was you, i had someone asking me about waves, because we were taking a look at a potential long for waves
okay? we were taking a look at waves for a potential long because it had a big, massive pump to the upside with a huge amount of volume
and, like i say, on most of the altcoins, okay, most of the old coins, i would say 99 of all coins
you know, if bitcoin is looking bearish and an altcoin looks pretty bullish, maybe for a potential long opportunity, then you know, it's not going to be worth taking that long of that long position on this altcoin
we were taking a look at waves, saying, wow, we've had insane, massive bullish momentum on waves with pretty high volume
you know, this could be the start of a higher low and maybe a retest of the highs
we were looking at six, one, eight levels, and, you know, it was looking pretty good for a potential long because we can see, you know, we did get one reaction at the six, one, eight, but came straight back down
and i did clarify on yesterday's stream, you know, you know, i wouldn't, i'm not going to take this long, i'm not going to take this long on waves, because we might be coming down to retest the low position here, the the low area of 20, over the 28th of may
bitcoin is was at the value area low here, breaking this level
and we were talking about yesterday, you know, this is going to start dropping very, very fast
why is it going to drop fast? because we've lost the value area, low of the trading range for the last 30 days
we've been trading inside of this range, above 28 600, major support for over 30 days
as soon as you start losing this level, you are going to come back down to retest these low areas at 25, 26 000
we are going to come down to these levels very likely in the coming days
so if you do have that weight, you do have that old coin, you know, that's had massive, big volume to the upside, you know, you break in certain levels, you do have some pretty nice spikes here on the vpvr where you could actually hold the range
we're hitting the seven eight here, to perfection of this um, of this fibonacci, uh, impulse
as you can see, the seven eight right over here, getting a little bit of a consolidation
okay? if we go to the one hourly, we're actually stopping at this range, at the seven eight um
but, yeah, on yesterday's live stream, i was saying, bitcoin is bearish er
the risk to reward is pretty, pretty high, you know, because if you start pumping here pretty, pretty aggressively on waves, you got big volume of buying pressure
i mean, of course, if you are trading waves, you want to use very, very low leverage
but it's, like i said, bitcoin comes down to retest 25 26 k levels in the next couple of days, you know, waves, it will be dragged back back down, very likely
uh, if waves does manage to consolidate at this range while bitcoin goes to 25 26k levels, then, yeah, i think, you know, i think a big bounce from these lows, like a double bottom scenario, in the immediate short term, is very, very likely for bitcoin
it's, it's, um, yeah, i think it's pretty foolish if you're trying to catch here, some some major, major, major longs here on on btc
um, like i said, ideal scenario for bitcoin would be that 28 212 maximum, if we were to manage to hit this level, i think, you know, we're looking for that parabolic move to the downside, right? that big, massive dump, because we are creating aggressive, aggressive lower highs
because, like i said, we've lost the value area low from this trading range
you know, any old coin that looks for a looks like it has a potential bullish price action, a bullish set up, then no rule number one, check out bitcoin
most of the altcoins are going to be bearish, even though they do have a potential bullish setup
uh, scotty, how are you doing? thanks for joining the live stream
i'm just having a little bit of a few days of no trading because, um, yeah, just because i had very, very good weeks but very much expecting this big, major downtrend
actually, we might be probably trading gmt for the for the competition
i will be extremely active with bitcoin and ethereum, and i might choose one or two altcoins to focus my analysis
a big mistake, of course, is taking a look at 10 cryptocurrencies, taking a look at 15 cryptos and doing analysis
i'm gonna do proper, proper analysis on bitcoin and ethereum, and i might choose one or two altcoins
and gmt is probably going to be one of those altcoins, because it has been really respecting some major levels
i made insane trades on on gmt over here, also right over here
gmt has respect has been respecting, you know, even textbook technical analysis
so you're getting the selling pressure right over here, creating this descending triangle
okay, inside of another descending triangle, that i'll explain right now, that we actually break in support
as you can see the back of this, you know, descending triangle scenario from the breakout, you know, met the target, the projected move, which is the back of the descending triangle, okay? the back of it is the projected move that you can get from this level
and it actually met the target here to perfection, retesting these lows, creating that kind of double bottom
but what is happening that? of course, you know, you i mean, this is pretty insane
i haven't been, i haven't been trading gmt for the last couple of weeks
i've only traded back here, uh, early, early may, and also in april, making very, very good trades on gmt
uh, you you can see this major, major support level on gmt, the one dollar 2025, getting that rejection also after the breakdown, bang, bang, bang, to the upside, getting that resistance, and then continuation to the downside
so what can we expect right now for gmt? what can we expect for gmt? let's zoom out a little bit here on gmt
this is the four hourly chart, and i can already see these major stops
and we were looking this as a, as a bearish pennant, because it was creating a kind of dece a symmetrical triangle
and this was, you know, we were just holding this major trend line with higher lows on gmt, looking for that breakout of this trend line
you know, it's just, once you lose this major support line from this uptrend, because it was still in an uptrend, that's it
anyway, not looking at the past, let's take a look at what potential future events and potential future levels
if we do take a look here at gmt, we're actually getting a stop from the lows here that we created on the 24th, 25th of of march
we've got a little bit of a spike here on the vpvr, the valley area low
um, we we're very likely going to have an aggressive drop on gmt, maybe to about 40 cents in the next coming days
potentially here's where we do have the next major value area high from this trading range
there's a big gap in volume in between the 65 cent level and the 42 cent level
very likely i'm gonna, i'll be looking for maybe gmt to trade on the competition
but i wanted to focus on some altcoins also because the percentage gains on all coins are much higher if you do get into really good trades
okay, so we need to create, we need to have big percentage gains on our trades on um in the competition, guys
this is where we could have the possibility in winning, just having those multiple hundred percentage gains on those trades
so we have that major daily level here on gmt at the 57 cents, major stop at that level
ideal scenario right now, what has happened to gmt? massive, massive descending triangle right over here, creating lower highs, another base here right over here, and then finally breaking down
if gmt does have a a little bit of a of a relief rally, a relief rally all the way up here to around about the 78, 78 cents, approximately, it's very likely going to get rejected
if we do get a small relief rally on gmt, round about that 78, 80 cent level, with a little bit of volatility, we've broken a major low range
continuation to the downside is very, very real, especially if we do see bitcoin coming down to retest the the 25k levels in the coming days
so if we do get a little bit of relief rally, yeah, i would probably, i would be probably jump into short position here
i'm going to put my my alarm here at 78, round about 78 cents here on gmt
i'll be looking at the price, the kind of price action that we're creating
if we do get a consolidation, i'll be looking for that short position
now, we do have a projected move or, but i think it's a little bit too aggressive, from a descending triangle point
okay, yeah, the minus 14 cents and this is, yeah, very unlikely to happen, of course, because you cannot go, you cannot go negative
if we do, if we do retrace all the way up here to that 78 cent level, i would very likely enter a short position, especially if bitcoins looking bearish
especially as bitcoin is hitting major resistance and is looking to roll back down, it will very likely drag some altcoins down, gmt being on one of them
and i would be aiming for a break down here and a support potential bounce
at 56 cents um, you might get a that would be a take profit one
um, so yeah, i do see more continuation to the downside to about 44, 45 range, where we do have the big spike on the vpvr
if we do get up to 78 cent level, it is a time for a potential short, especially if you do have a little consolidation
let's take a look at the, uh, the comment section i got ibrahimov, ibrahim john saying, trx is bullish
it's kind of been having fake outsy of this ascending channel
it's slightly been breaking the resistance and support levels, as you can see from this kind of ascending channel
let me just as you can see, this level has been pretty, pretty huge, big consolidations, double top range here on trx
this is ready to actually fall and come all the way down to roundabout the five cent level, which is the summer 2021 lows
okay? we did create this low also, just slightly above 5 cents, 51 cents
trx is just very, very likely going to have continuation to the downside, breaking this ascending channel, the bear flag scenario
another reason why, you know, is it is basically creating a massive descending triangle
so let me just clean out the chart here from old analysis of some of these, all of these different lines that do have here in the in the past
there's a massive, big swing failure pattern that happened right there
but yeah, basically you are creating aggressive lower, lower, uh, lower heights, lower highs over here
look at this magical resistance as you can see this is a massive bearish, bearish pattern, basically descending, kind of triangle scenario, getting those bounces out that five cent level
uh? this is, this is most likely, in the next coming weeks, going to retest the five percent level
this is a very, very aggressive trend, having that rejection here from this super eight and, uh, sorry, you know, nine, nine cent level, approximately
this is, this is very, very likely going to come down to the five cent level
basically this is going to take weeks, maybe, to come all the way down to a five cent level
it is in a bullish uptrend here, but if you zoom out, you can clearly see it is in a very, very aggressive downtrend, a very aggressive low highs, major trend line getting respected here as resistance
you're actually hitting, was it the 50 percent fibonacci retracement from this drop
and i mean, getting per getting perfectly rejected from the 50 fibonacci retracement 618 is very unlikely to get
we are very unlikely going to get this to the 618, of course, because of the huge resistance that we do have above us
we have been respecting this major 9 cent level here a few times in the past
just a few days ago, we came up to the 50 financial retracement from this major drop
it hitting it almost to the exact scent, going slightly above the 50 level
we know it's a major, major range here where we've consolidated for a long time
i mean, the probabilities on this coming down in the next coming weeks to the five cent level, even slightly below, is just very, very high
it's in insanely high, you know, 80, i would say, just to be a little bit more conservative, 75 chance that in the next coming weeks, trx will be trading at the 5 cent level
the i mean, one of the main reasons why, in my personal opinion, okay, one of the main reasons why trx has been having bullish momentum, i think it's because of, you know, usd usdt um, because of the stablecoin um, because it's extremely cheap transactions, extremely cheap transactions of us
i think a lot of a lot of stable coins are being transacted, transacted on the tron network at this moment, and it's just managing to with all those insane transactions happening in trx and trc 20
i think it's just holding the having a little bit of bullish momentum here the last few months, uh, thanks to the stable coins being transacted in in the tron network
that is the only thing i do think that why tron is having it, is holding a little bit this range
but it will push down, especially if bitcoin's gonna have that bearish momentum in the next coming days and weeks
this is very, very likely going to have an aggressive drop down to retest the lows here
double top, confirmed double top here on trx with this insane wick
um, we have not seen fibonacci time zone for a very long time
can you do that on btc? you mean, on bull and bear time period? thanks
i mean, i'm, i am gonna, uh, maybe not today, because i'll have to figure out a little bit, you know, what kind of, um, where am i gonna put, um, place the fibonacci time uh, you know what? just to be clear, the absolute bottom here, from this range, fibonacci time to the alltime high, this is a question of many, what? what? what was the peak? because when you create a double top scenario, in this case on bitcoin, we have touched, you know, we have actually had another alltime high in november
but some people say that the real peak was in april of 2021, and this was a double top
and some other people say the top here was in november of 2021
i would like to know the community, okay, answer me in the comment section, where was the peak of the bull run on bitcoin? was it april of 2021? or was it november of 2020? 2021? because some say, because this is a double top, the actual real peak was this one here in april 2021
because when you're looking for impulsive waves, you are looking for a low level of a big, massive wave
and we can see march of 2020 was a low on bitcoin, and we had a pretty pretty aggressive, impulsive move to the upside
if we take a look at fibonacci time, we actually at the onetoone levels here of this potential correction, right? there's been an abc correction, right? and we are at the very, very, are very, very low levels here
it needs to be in between the one to one and the 1618, until january of 2023
so a bearish, you know, seven months is very, very likely also
um, of course, if we were to look at this over here being the peak the onetoone, it would be at least till the 23rd of july, if we were to see this as the alltime high on bitcoin
so, yeah, a little bit of more bearish momentum is is very, very likely
sideways action, bearish momentum, at least till the end of 2022, january of 2021, which would be the one, the 1618, from this being the impulse
i'm telling you, it's very likely gonna be boring, but it's gonna be the boring times are the exciting times
god has given us this opportunity and actually having cheap bitcoin and cheap crypto
i know most of you watching this live stream started investing in 2021, in 2022
the reason why i know is because i did create a poll, okay, asking you, did you invest in crypto in 2021? in 2022? i think it was about 65 70 of people said, yes, they started
of you guys watching this live stream are the ones that are going to hang around for the next couple of years and just be patient and buy up some more bitcoin, ethereum and some good all coins
like i said yesterday, you know, these are extreme ex this is extreme support level
we are we basically, yeah, we almost hit the, well, we almost hit already the 1 400 range, major target that we were talking about yesterday
you know, if bitcoin, bitcoin, if ethereum did lose this level, it's going to start dropping heavily
i know a lot of people are looking for those retracements to get into some trades, but this is what happens when you lose a big, major level
so maybe jumping on a trade on ins inside of the drop is a good idea
of course, i did not trade this um, not trading during the weekend
this is very much that level that we were talking about yesterday
i think yesterday we were trading around about the 1000, 1 600 and something like that, 1 600, uh, approximately yesterday
we've actually retested the 1 423 lower should be coming, especially bitcoin
this does have a little bit more bearish momentum, 1 400, even 1 300 from this impulsive move from the breakout of this descending triangle
what would be the ideal scenario here? i'm going to wait patiently
can we go lower from this range and the and the drop is still going to be this aggressive, yes
but opportunity here for a big trade, like i said, is if we have that relief rally, what if um ethereum has a pretty nice relief rally before potential bearish continuation? that is going to be the trading opportunity
the 1700 level is extreme, extreme support level that has been broken
and if we come back up there to have a little bit of a relief rally, this level is going to be so, so solid
if we do come up there, it's going to be an insane shorting opportunity
big spike on the vpbr at these levels for bearish continuation
the question is, are we going to manage to get up there? i mean, we've probably not
we're probably going to continue this aggressive drop because we just don't have any volume, hardly any volume profile here
uh, this was very much mentioned yesterday that we we were very gonna have, we were gonna have this aggressive drop to the downside very likely after losing such a strong level
you know, our next major lows is the the alltime high from 2018
you lose the level, you will come down to the next major support level in between 1 300 and 1 400
there'll be a little bit of mark where, there'll be a little bit of volatility around those levels
it's going to be an insane shortening opportunity the amount of pressure that the balls need to do to break above one thousand seven hundred dollars
we're gonna have a, you know, many months ahead, i think, of of boring action
if we come up back up there, i mean, this is going to be resistance
so ethereum is very likely going to get rejected from that level
um, especially if we do consolidate and have multiple attempts in trying to get above this range, it's very likely going to have a big rejection
from the 1 300, 1400, some kind of relief rally should happen in the coming months
if bitcoin does come down to retest the 25 26 000 range, losing a few thousand dollars in value, i'm also looking for a potential relief rally, double bottom scenario
i don't think we're gonna aggressively drop to twenty thousand, eighteen thousand dollars
we're gonna have some sideways action, a little bit of a relief rally
but if it does come down to 25k, 26k levels in the next coming hours, couple of days, we're going to see ethereum drop to around about 1 300 levels
okay? and that is the range where we are looking for that relief rally
the alltime high of 2018, the lows here created in march of 2021
ideal scenario would be getting a relief rally on on ethereum
uh, it's going to be very hard to come all the way up here to around about the 1 700 range, 1 650, if it even does manage to come to the 1650, that is already a 200 pump on ethereum
it's very, very hard to see that pump, i think, in the next coming hours
if you do get that relief rally, continuation to the downside is just almost imminent, in my, in my personal opinion
what could happen is it you just maybe going to consolidate for a bit and have a little bit more continuation to the downside, then looking for that big bounce at that level
let me take a look at the daily chart, because i haven't, i haven't done proper, proper analysis on on ethereum
and if you take a look at the um, at the price action from ethereum, i mean, this is going to be pretty impressive
this is we were actually one dollar away, one dollar away from this daily level
the daily level from march of 2021, there hasn't been retested for over one and a half years
okay, this daily level hasn't been retested one one year and three months, getting that insane bounce, guys
daily close from march of 2021, you can speculate getting these bounces
i mean, and this is how we're gonna, this is how we're gonna trade the the competition
you know, mo a lot of people, a lot of people that are new, also in crypto, are, you know, are thinking, right, shall i long or should i short from this level? you have no, absolutely no idea where the price action is going to go in the next coming hours
but what you need to have is these major, daily, weekly levels marked up these impulsive moves, looking at fibonacci, you know, retracement fibonacci time to see if we are good in time for that potential short or long, or if we overextended in time, do we need to exit? i mean, this is the thing i'm going to be extremely active looking at, you know, different charts, explanations for those trading opportunities
because we're going to absolutely crush the competition, guys
i'm telling you, i'll be waking up, you know, at six o'clock in the morning, i'll be going for my morning run, having my coffee and full analysis, looking for those major levels to get into
absolutely crazy, how ethereum touched almost to that exact dollar, that daily level, which was from march of 2021
and this is how we are going to, you know, look for those opportunities
and if you're looking at the one hourly chart, you know, hey, andy, if you long to this level, where is going to be your take profit? where? what are you aiming for? well, of course, i would be looking at the one hourly chart, you know, check out where we at, and looking at this impulsive move
you know, bitcoin ethereum has been moving in impulses and consolidations
so if you take a look at the one hourly chart, okay, and we're looking at fibonacci, we do have these impulsive moves
so if we're looking at fibonacci retracement? you know, are we taking about fibonacci retracement from this consolidation in the short term? you know, if we're doing some day trades, you want to take a look at major levels of of take profit
so if we take a look at this consolidation, the impulsive move starts from round about this level
you could say this range, but no, you're still consolidating here
so from this level over here, we could actually zoom out on the 30 minute and you can even go as low as this range here
so basically, you are aiming for 50 fibonacci 618 levels for taking profit
so if you've got into that daily bounce, you're looking to take profit at fifty percent, six one eight, from the start of this impulsive move to the downside
it's very, very possible we actually go up to the one thousand five hundred dollars and hit the six one eight, where we are very likely gonna get rejected
if we're looking for some day trades here on ethereum, look at this
that was created at five o'clock central european time yesterday
we're probably going to get heavily, everybody heavily rejected
if you about, if you did get into that daily level bounce, i didn't
i don't give a damn, because i'll be absolutely crushing the charts by next week, guys
monday tomorrow is going to be absolutely insane, fullon trading
if i would have done full analysis on ethereum, i would very, very likely jumped on a, on a long position at this daily level
i think we could get that relief rally to those levels and then consolidate and continue down, especially if we do have low volume on the move up
it's a very, very solid level here with some pretty high volume
so yeah, if we retrace to those levels with low volume, it's going to likely get rejected 1 500
when you break certain support levels, as you can see here, the 1 700, you're thinking to yourself, where can the price stop? where can the price get a a severe bounce? well, you know, it's, and i've been talking about the the big drop that was very likely going to happen on ethereum, because you're basically losing the strongest level of support, and you have a big gap on in in the volume profile
so the drop is very likely to happen pretty fast, down to this 1 400 range
but if you, if you think to yourself, where can the price stop, guys? and this is what you need to know as traders
you need to know where you're going to have that reaction, at resistance, at support to take that training opportunity
and you know, looking at ethereum, right over here, this major daily level for that potential bounce
you know, it's 28th of of march and the 1st of march here, major daily levels at that range where you are going to get that big bounce
uh, you know my deal on bitcoin and ethereum, we're focusing on bitcoin and ethereum, as you know here, mainly
i'm gonna try and make a video update or a live stream afterwards
we're focusing on bitcoin, focusing on ethereum, stay cautious, guys
best case scenario here for bitcoin, for a potential trade, would be getting that pump all the way up here to the 279, 28k levels
uh, we having massive bearish momentum lost the valley area low
do you want to jump in a short position here? it is up to you guys
if we have small relief rallies, it's going to be better to get into a nice, nice trade

smash up that like button, and i will see you in the next one
just one second, i'm just gonna give everyone the content, and then we're going right away to the charts and see what monday or the next week, and bring us, hopefully i will find some good setups
but we're just gonna have to go inside and see if it's just like, a little higher low created, or if it is actually another lower low
how are you waiting for that fib video? well, that fifth video, we were supposed to have 200 likes on one live during the live stream
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can help me reach out to more people, and we can show them exactly how easy it actually can be sometimes to look at the technical i hope my microphone is better today
how are you? hi natalie, how are you? i shorted et and got stopped out in the last fake pump now, which drop leaves me behind? yes, we can go in and see what happened where, uh, you can just tell me cut
um, uh, where were your entry and where were your stop loss? i think that's the most important thing
marianne, hello, how are you? filip? let's go into the charts guys and see what's happening
first of all, i want to see what can possibly happen, uh, during in next uh week
so i go into forex factory, because i want to see if the dollar is, uh, does have something that can affect the market very much
what is that? do? do we have anyone from australia here? is there anything special? what are you guys celebrating that we are not celebrating? are you celebrating something without the rest of the world? why? joking
we got three, one, two, three different news we got, uh, the first news, it's supposed to be, uh, can affect the market, changing the price of finnish goods and service sold by products
actual forest gets released monthly, about 13 days after the month, and source change to risk
okay, so we do have something by tuesday that can affect the markets a little bit
um, we also have, we got a lot of news coming out this week on usd
okay, we can go into ethereum, right away after this, so we can look at what you uh, so what what? we can see what happened? um, oh, palma is here
we have a lot of news coming out on our, um, australian dollars, too
so we got every single day on bit, sorry, on usd so we need to be, we need to understand when the when the news does come out
so if this is gonna happen now, so just think about this, okay
so if we do have a lot of news coming out, and, let's say the market will be very bearish, i know a lot of people will freak out
because if we're looking at it, we're gonna go in and look at ethereum soon and see what happened
if you didn't look at the video that i did, uh, post yesterday, i was talking about this, uh, i was talking about short term and long term
but on the long term, on this video we spoke about, and i spoke about this long time ago, long, long, long, long time ago
it is 18 day left of this three monthly candle, and we are inside the fibonacci levels right now
the only thing, if we have this, if we have so many news coming out this week, i'm actually a little bit, ah, so if we're gonna go down lower, i think a lot of people will freak out, to be honest
because with this much news, and if everything's gonna be bearish, we are about to dump
and that's not gonna look so good on the charts, right? i'm a trader, so i don't really, really, really care about it like that
of course i care about it, but it's, it's easier for me as a trader to just sell the market
but the thing was that on the higher time frames, we we already knew, or i already knew, that this fibonacci levels that were in between, this is something that we've been speaking about for a long time
but okay, so if we see that the market is now breaking, potentially 26 300, now, we're gonna think a scenario where we see the market pulling back even more
uh, if we, if we would now see that the market is breaking this fibonacci level at 618 percent, which can definitely happen around 26 300
so the next level? remember now that the market is always, always trading from level to level
so if we break one level, we need to come back down to the next level
and the next level for me is this little support and the resistance zone at eighteen thousand
and some people will actually think that this is really good, because obviously they, you know, buy by low, right? um, yes
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
anything you want to share with us, don't don't click the like button
okay, so, yeah, this is definitely something that we can expect the market to do
but we can go to dxi just to see what the xy, just to see what could potentially happen if we're just going to start over again
so before, we were looking at the xy on the six monthly chart, and i still want to do that, because if we're just zooming out and we're using the trend line
and we've been talking at this for a long time, so it is obviously, oh, it's 18, it's 18 days left of this
so we can actually see that the market has been on, uh, on dollars
so we're just gonna go down to the two monthly charts, just so we can make it a little bit more clear
so we came back down and retested the level around this previous resistance at 102200
but we can monthly chart perfect retest of this previous resistance
let's see where is the next level? so sometimes if if it feels like it's hard to to see where the next level can be, it's always good to use the the line chart so we can see more clear because you can see the this, this has gotta be stuck in the name of b2c and so cool
so the next level we can potentially see dollar come up to a retest, could be a 108 points and 950 or 109600
we obviously also have a little zone right here from this candle, this green candlestick
on the three monthly chart, you saw this huge bounce back down
so we we're gonna retest this level before we're reaching also, that level is around 105600, 1068 on the three monthly chart
okay, so we're just going up on dxi, and bitcoin is going down
so even if we would see some momentum to, even if we would see some momentum to the upside, i think it's gonna, i mean, it's not gonna break, it's not gonna break the the option, uh, the downtrend
but yes, remember, guys, if we break to 26 400, okay, looking at the lower time frame first, before we, uh, reach 18, 18 000, we also have this little previous support
so if we just zoom in, so what we're going to do is that we're just going to make this looking good
so between 23 740 and 23 and 200, what happened? oh, we have to drag it
okay, we can come back down to twenty three thousand seven hundred
if we break this zone, the next zone to retest is eighteen thousand
okay, going to the lower time frames now, because we broke this previous report that we did have around twenty eight thousand six hundred and fifty
if you, if you also did look at the light, at the video that i did have yesterday, alert set up for bitcoin coming
i what i did was that i took a fibonacci from this high to the low
i did expect the market to pull back up to 28 872 or potentially 28 990
but we actually saw a really good read test on the lower time frames two times
and this screamed the market was suppose was supposed to go, uh, continue back down
so i was asleep at this time, so i was not able to take these trades
obviously still come back up and retest the previous support, but by just trying to identify this drop that we do have at the moment
i actually had a friend here today, and i asked him to, um, to look at the microphone, but didn't work
oh, can you see how perfect this was? what the heck? i just missed it
everything is, i don't know why, you know, everything is just not working with me when it comes to technical things
if this, if this is, um, a valid fibonacci, take profit one would be at six thousand nine hundred and twenty four
take profit two would be twenty six thousand two hundred and thirteen
and take profit three, twenty five thousand six hundred and thirty
um, going to the higher time frames, just to make sure what we're looking at
and if we close like this, we will also have a an evening star
and we're still maintaining the the trend line, but i don't think this is gonna be looks
so, okay, so the market has already done the move, so i cannot do anything at the moment right? the market is obviously going down, right? but if we would see the market having some momentum to the upside, um, a bigger push to the upside
but if that is the case, if we see the market drop even more, we can come back up to the trend line again
but i don't have a setup at the moment, because the market has obviously already, you know, dropped from the fibonacci levels kind of pretty perfectly
i'm very good at technical analysis when it comes to the to trading
and now we're going to look at what happened to, we're going to look and see what happened to the trade
and he said that the entry was at 1450, and his stoploss at, stop loss at, let's see, 1500, 1520
and he said, that did you, did you sell the market? and i need to, i need to look at hi natalie
how are i shorted? are you shorted? ethereum and got stopped out on out in the last fake pump
okay, maria and anita, look over my brother's account, smashing that like button
okay, so karam, do you really want to have an an honest answer? you want to have an honest answer? this trade was screaming your stoploss was about to get hit because you sold the market at the low
if you sold the market at 1 450, you had your stoploss at 1 570
i mean, you can obviously do that, but this is, this is what happened
with the help of the fibonacci, or help of a previous support, we dragged the fibonacci from the high 1547, back down to the low at 1 428
we could also have taking the fibonacci, just to make sure that, um, look at the higher time frames
so what i did, what i took a fibonacci from this high, this high, from 1548
so, oh, come on, come you had the stop loss where you should have sold the market, darling
you weren't, i don't know exactly where you sold it, but this was a fake out, fake out from a previous support market came back up, gave us a little fake out, and then huge boom
so this is why it's so important for us to um, to look at the higher time frames perspective
and when you saw that the market came back, um, when you saw that the market came up to this level, what we also could have done is that we could have dragged the fibonacci back up to 1500, because that is very good, combined with where the support was that we did break
and the market came up exactly and retested these levels very, very, very beautifully
so when you sold the market at the low, this is why i always tell you guys, when we sell the market, we always sell the market at the lower high
because what happens when you buy the market at the lower low? market does this
now, you know, now, you know, next time, with a little bit more of patience, try to understand, ask yourself, where am i in the market? market created a, what? a lower high, lower low, and after a lower low, and we start to see the market pull back up
but would never have the power to break this level at this candlestick
close your position right away, even if, even if you get taken in, stop loss
but when we see that, the the the we do expect, after we drop, we do expect the market to pull back up
and this is gonna happen over and over again until we learn exactly how to do it
i mean, this is the, this is the thing, we learn from our mistakes, right? we learn from our mistakes, and we just move on with the life
sometimes, i also, you know, even today, i also sometimes trade at the lower low because i just didn't see it, or whatever
um, we're just gonna continue to wait to see if we pull back up, potentially to the to the resistance again, or if this fibonacci is valid, we just might see the market pull back down to 1 390
if we have a bigger drop, we want to go back in time and see where we are in the market right now
look at the three monthly chart the same way we did on bitcoin
look, guys, would you have such a huge, volatile candlestick right now? um, and we are right now retesting the 618 on the three monthly chart
if we break that level, the next level for us to come back down to a retest is 1220 or 20

okay, so let's see what else we the other periods that you want me to look at? i think i saw ajay, i think i saw ada in the beginning
daniel, okay, so we do have some set up since a couple of days ago
when did we have this retest? yesterday? oh, so if you were on my previous live stream, when did i have that one? one day ago
this is why you should follow me guys, even though i'm never, i'm never a financial advisor, but the setups is crazy
retested the fifty percent, take profit two that hits, looking at the lower time frames, came back up
if i would have been a little bit unsure, we could have taken another fib from 5 384 back down to 5292
we can have gone into the five minutes charts and saw the market, oh, this doesn't look so good
uh? one, two, three, four weeks on this candlestick, either i would have a settlement order or bought the market when this 15 minutes candle closed
on this one also got hit, but this was mostly a second confirmation for an entry
go down to the lower time frames now to see what could potentially happen
yeah, i would, i would just wait for the market now, to be honest, and see what could potentially happen tomorrow
i don't want to give you anything right now, because i want to see
okay, the daily will close with a bearish, can, pretty heavily bearish candlestick
and we're closing below a previous support, a previous higher low, right here
but if we would see some momentum, uh, if we would see some momentum to the upside
we're always using previous support and resistance zones, and this is all we have already retested at one time
you can see, yeah, retesting market bounce back down, but we can definitely pull back up to this level again
i mean, the market, i mean it can definitely just have market can just obviously continue back down
but we also have a preview support right here, around, what? 5 100
we can't see the market pull back down to this support, because, remember, market comes back down to a support, pulls back up to a previous other support, creates a resistance, and then slowly said, if we see the market pull back down, because the move has already happened, but we're retesting, as i said, 5100
i don't have any good setups at the moment, because the market is bouncing in between here right now, and the market did retested it, so the sell opportunity was around this previous support
so, and we're just gonna try to make sure that we can look at every coin
not every coin, that's obviously gonna take my whole life, and i don't think i got time for that, and i don't think you either
i do really appreciate the feedback that you give, that you give me
okay, so we're heading back down to the previous support, as you can see here
so if you, if you don't find anything at the side, we always go back to the left because the market would always retest previous prices support
i'm just joking, but you're technically not a spanish guy when you're from uk
um, i mean, it's really hard to analyze the charts when the market is, when the market is just dropping
and this is the thing, guys, it's really hard, it's really hard to analyze a chart when you just see it melting down like this
one thing that we can, we can use is this resistance trend line from the drop that we did have the last if we see that, the market would potentially break above, uh, six thousand and nine hundred and potentially give a retest
this can be a little pullback back up to seven thousand six hundred
because, remember, we can come back up and retest a previous um his previous support, turning it to a new resistance [Music]
this just might be where the market could potentially give me a new um, lower high
go down to the lower time frames, you can see the market all so this is the thing
can you see? market came back up, retested the previous lower high at 6890, around that level, broken lower high
if we see the break, the market will just repeat what it did here, right? come back up, retest, then continuous back down
so it kind but you could obviously also see the market just come back down to the support again to see the push back to the upside, right? and then see the market create the previous lower low as a new high low for then give us a bigger pullback, and then see the drop
i'm just repeating it because this is what can potentially happen, right? uh? fed announcement wednesday
perhaps we bounce tonight, create a higher low, go sideways, then finally, uh, still waiting for a big can show me the bottom line? yeah, yeah
we just, we went through that um in the beginning, and that it
we can definitely see some moments this week, because we have so many news coming out
we have, this is, it's gonna be crazy week, but it's gonna be exciting
you mind checking grt for a good looking mood after checking the rest? i'm not my own moderator
if we're looking at the daily we're just bouncing in between, um, 7056315, potentially now
we are at the low, right? if we break it, i'm not sure exactly how far we can go back down, to be honest
but if we see that the market pulls back up, we can come back up and retest this previous resistance at zero, eight, one, four, three, six, seven, nine
around these levels, guys, around these levels, if you break above this, uh level that i just spoke about, look at previous support and resistance zones where you can see the market bouncing between
but always remember now that on the higher time frames we are in a sideways market
so when we try, when the market tries to break the support, and if if we do that, always look at the next candlestick, because if the next candlestick is closing above the support that we tried to break, that is a fake out
it doesn't mean it will reverse completely, but that will definitely be a fake out
and that could be us coming back up to retest the previous report
so it's pretty hard, as i told you, when we don't have anything else to look at to lift because we are at the low
um, do you consider any possible movements you to be to see? strawberry blonde lives matters? i'm not sure
i'm not sure if that's how you pronounce it, but in swedish it looks sounds like that
we have sebzep, the strawberry, the strawberry ginger blonde guy from uk
so guys, where are you from? raj, you are my favorite trading teacher
okay, uh, we looked at so while you're telling me where you from, i'm gonna go and figure out where the next coin, what the next coin is
but where are the coins? kode ah for dar uh, according all usdt, and we're gonna look for south
can you like curl, weekly, monthly, gut and yes, we can look at that one
um, charlotte, i have to quote it off because i just wrote it, and i just don't want to take it away
but looking at, quote it all, we are coming back down to a support at one point four thousand, three hundred and thirty three
we can come back down into one point three thousand eight hundred and thirteen
going back in time, you can see that from this level right here, you saw this huge push, right? so this is definitely a level, uh, we will come back down and retest um
if we break, uh, the level that i just spoke about, we can come back down to 0950, because that is also a previous zone where you saw the market broke from and then had a huge push created the low
and looking at who we are right now, it is the most important thing, right? so we're just going to take the trend line, a very ugly trend line
we're going to take it from the top, and we're just going to try to connect it
and it doesn't look good at all, i'm gonna say, because the market is just having one huge something like that
but we have a previous report that we also broke around one thousand, uh, one thousand eight hundred
one point eight thousand six hundred and one point nine thousand two hundred and sixty
you know, it's straight the market looking like this, 2 hourly
if you continue to drop right now, because we came back up and retested 16590
and use if we see the market continue to drop, we can come back down and create so this was the last lower low
the last lower low was at one point five thousand two hundred and thirty four
the next lower low can potentially be at one point four thousand five hundred and fifty four
but if we see that the market is giving us some a pullback to the upside now, and if you break the resistance trend line, and we see a potential retest against one point six thousand and seven hundred around this level, this could be a push back up to one point eight thousand seven hundred and four, potentially one point nine thousand and three hundred and one thousand, one point nine thousand three hundred and ten, because that was the previous report that we did break
so we all always need to make sure that we understand, if we see pullback to the upside, don't be just like all the markets just changing direction
now, no, the marketers just might just need to make a bigger pullback to come back up and retest the support
so these are the levels where i look at right now when it comes to kodiak
on the monthly chart, i cannot use a fibonacci because we don't have any goods
i don't have a low or a high for me to use, because if i use this, this low to this high, we've already broke that fibonacci
but we're definitely heading back down to this previous support at also, on the monthly now, between one, zero point one thousand two hundred and fifty and, uh, zero points, one thousand one hundred and thirty three
go down to the weekly chart, because you also wanted me to look at the weekly
i don't have any fibonacci levels here either on the weekly chart, to where i can use because i don't have, when when i use the fibonacci, i want to have it from one high to one low
so this is why it's hard for me to use the higher time frames fibonacci, because it makes no sense
from this you saw this huge push, right? if we break that level, well, we're coming back down, kind of, uh, know where i will buy
we also have this slow so we do have, i would use this candlestick, because from this candlestick you saw this huge push, right? 1 200
you break that low, we have this one at zero point, six hundred and ten and if you go down to even to the lower time frames, yeah, 1200, i would say, first of all
and yeah, we want to see how the market is behaving around these levels
i mean, we can definitely, just, if we see a push to the upside later, well, we will come back up and retest this previous lower low
but she wanted me to look at the higher time frames, um levels
so these are the ones that i that i see the market can come back down and retest
uh, my name is natalie, and if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that
every single morning, from monday to friday, i have a morning live streams, 8 am, swedish time
this is where we go into the charts together every single morning
and no financial advisor, but sometimes we get some really good setups, or at least see where the market can come to during the day
so from where you are right now, 10 hours ahead, and we'll see each other again
and don't forget, guys, that you can also receive the best bonus available on buy bits, up to four thousand and fifty dollars, by using the link in the description down below the video
okay? so we're heading back down to this previous resistance that we didn't have at 39 points
if you go down now to the lower time frames and see what's happening, guys, it's just a falling knife
because when we have this falling knife, we just might see the market and give us a big pullback to the upside
and while everyone is thinking the market will break to the upside forever, the market is just giving us the pullback
okay, so we could see, if we only see a small pullback now, we can come back to 4670 and 4692 for a quick retest, and that could be the continuation down
fibonacci that we retested from the 618 percent for the 812 take profit one is down at 4124 dollars
so take so technically the next low, if we break the next lower low, this is a perfect one to come back down to
um, but this is only if we see the market giving us a great retest, a quick retest, and give us doji's
and this wig that we do have, we can definitely come back down and and fill the way, go down to, the oh, this is a huge fake out though
what are you? what are you doing? so these guys with the blue font of their names, are they your yeah, they are
okay, so if we're looking at to where we are right now, we are about to break 3232
we saw the huge push to the upside, going down to the lower time frames
if we just want to zoom in a little bit extra, we're just gonna do it like this
can you see how perfectly this week also came back down and retested the clothes of this week that we didn't have on june 21st? um, okay, so let's zoom out
i'm not even gonna say your name, because that is the really bad name in swedish
i'm her future ex hobby, but i'm just, oh, samson, you're so such a fun guy
and so the market, if we break this level, we can come back down to 2434 and 2280, if we see the market break this level
so now we're looking at the weekly charts, going down to the lower time frames
it's just, it's better when the market have some more momentum to the upside, because that's when we're looking to see where the next potential lower high can be
and looking at the 12 hourly chart, if we see a pullback, we can also come back up and retest 3790
so these are the previous support and resistance zones that i use because, um, i don't have any fibonacci levels right now, because we have to, we have to have a low for us to be able to to put the fibonacci and we don't have that
if we take the fib from 4126 back down to 3276 dollars, and the 618 percent is exactly combined with the low that i spoke about, 3785
so if we say, you pull back, this is definitely a level where i can see the market and pull back up to a retest, and then see the market, um, continue, uh, to the downside
i would take it from the i'm actually, if i see the market pull back up to this level, you know what i'm gonna do? i'm actually gonna trade it
i remember someone said in this live stream that asked me about forex pairs uh
and said that the the cryptocurrencies does not read test market structure
was it fibonacci levels? to be honest, i'm not gonna lie when i backtest the market, because i'm back i back test, uh, these coins every single day
and they actually retest support and resistance zones, and they actually read is the fibonacci level
and the only thing that when it comes to cryptocurrencies, uh, compared to forex pairs, is that, um, forex pairs is, uh, no, cryptocurrencies is more volatile
but when the market, when the cryptocurrencies comes to fibonacci levels, they actually respect them very, very much
the only thing is that we need to, we definitely need to back test it so we understand it
but i've been doing this back testing on these coins now every single day since august last year
i was, i just saw a september, he said that i'm and his daughter
yeah, i'm getting so tired now when i, i'm like, when i see substance comments, it's just crazy
it was one time, one time, i'm just gonna tell you this now, while i'm looking for the next coin to look at
i saw some of the guys from the moderators, we had this the chat, and they wrote something, and i just, i just started to laugh so much on, oh, i i remember, i had like 200 people
now too, obviously, um, but at that time, it was really much for me
i got 200 people watching my live stream, and i see and i see these, yeah, for the oh god
so these 200 people turn into like 100 people, and then like 70 people, because i couldn't stop laugh i couldn't stop laughing
because the guys were trying to to come, you know, get in contact with me, because there were so many people who wrote it [Music]
it's so important to laugh, right? because the charts can definitely make us being depressed sometimes
guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that
and what i'm to do is that, okay, first of all, we're going to use this low at 46 dollars
it's always very important, because it can actually be that it comes back down and we test this level, and then we just might potentially see a little bounce
i'm not gonna lie and and with the news coming out this week, oh, it's not, it's not good
who knows? who knows? this just might be where you we never know
going to the lower time frames now, because this is only the higher time frames targets, depending if you break it or not, going to where we are at the moment
if we would see the market pull back up, because you can see obviously how the market is creating lower lows, lower highs, right? and this is the correct, this is the correct trend line to have in on this move
if we break below this level, and we see retests from below, this is where we can come back down to 43 dollars, if we would see the market create this, uh, for the nine support, as a continuation, as a support, if we would see the market break the resistance trend line, which it definitely can do
because if we find this assay support, we can have a bigger push, and potentially, 61 dollars, the previous support can turn into a new resistance
so this level is very important for us to use if we would see some market um, have some momentum
okay, so you don't want to eat lunch with me, really? everyone still want to eat lunch with andy, but no one wants to eat lunch with natalie
okay, we did look at ltc, but g oh, was it gmt for uh, sebsem
have you ever heard that before? when you ask your your girlfriend or wife if she's angry and she says, no, i'm not
and then everything that you do, she's like, i'm not mad, but you see that she's mad, but she said, no, i'm not jealous
and then when you decide to go out with your friends, she's like, oh, so you're gonna go out with your friends? huh? guys, you're have you living the living the dream
if you want to be part of the consensus community, you have the link to the chat in the, uh, in the chat, in the live chat, we have two different ones
the first one is a little smaller group where i am more of control with and this is where you can be more in touch with me
and you also have the big bitcoin census group, where we do have like 2 000 people on that
everyone is their own path of uh when it comes to trading, or if you're an investor, whatever
um, but we speak with respecting these chats, and we share our knowledge
and if you're new, you can obviously always ask a question and you will have an answer
so you are more than welcome to be part of bitcoin census community
um, the next okay, so what i'm going to do is that i'm going to do this
we came back down from this fibonacci level that we saw the retest from
but usually what the market does is it also use it as levels where you see the market balance in between
and if we see a huge drop, the next, uh, the next level is 370
it looks kind of, uh, you and other lovely, kind, beautiful people
pretty fun and that size are your glasses? i don't know, i don't know
okay, guys, let's see, um, i'm gonna end this live stream right now
if you want to be part of the consensus community, everything is obviously for free
we have tiktok, we have twitter, we have facebook, we have um
so on the monthly chart, we did break this previous resistance at 102 point, 180
so the next level for us to come back up and retest is point 1055
from these levels, you can obviously see the market pull back down again
we did retest this previous resistance one time already, created as a support
so the next level for us to to see if we see a retest from is, as i told you, 105690 or 106995
you can also receive, uh, just blow down my entire account, please
if you don't want to blow your account, you can go to my youtube channel and look at my previous videos, because i show you exactly how to look at market structure, because market structure is usually what the what people don't understand, and that's why they lose their money on their or blow their accounts
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
we see each other in a couple of hours in monday's live stream
seb seb and lauren and raj and charlotte, charlotte and bernie and god and everyone else will be in to mesh
my name is josh, and this important bitcoin indicator is flashing a brand's new signal that we need to pay attention to
and while that is happening, we're seeing the bitcoin long positions over on bitfenix absolutely explode, with 15 billion dollars entering into these long positions just in recent months
so i'll be covering all of that in just a moment, alongside ethereum later in this video
as ethereum is getting closer to that price target that i set a few days ago, so definitely stick around to the end of this video so that you don't miss out on any of these important information
and what i mentioned in my last bitcoin update video that i posted yesterday on the channel, was basically a risk of the bitcoin price reentering into this price range in between 28 and a half thousand and around 22 and a half thousand
and in case you're new to the channel, this green line is the 1000 day moving average, and the red line is the 200 week moving average
and every significant bitcoin bottom, basically all of the best buying opportunities throughout bitcoin's history, like the end of bear markets, for example, or the march 2020 crash, have occurred while the bitcoin price is in between these moving averages
and basically the closest was the 200 week moving average, the better the opportunity, historically speaking
and so once again, right now, at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is in this price range, in between these moving averages, which does not happen very often
once again, this only usually happens towards the end of a bear market, or in that black swan event in early 2020
but once again, this is a range that goes down towards the 200 week moving average, sitting at around 223 k
so technically speaking, with that in mind, there's still some room to the downside
but the room to the downside is very limited, according to bitcoin's entire price history
and also, if you're looking at the weekly bitcoin rsi, we're getting extremely close to oversold territories
we've only ever seen that happen just two other times, which was at the end of the 2018 bear market, and at the end of the 2014 bear markets, when the bitcoin price was basically bottoming out, getting ready for a big consolidation and another bull run in months later
and now taking a look at the daily bitcoin charts, because we have a brand new signal flashing right now
and this indicator is known as the hash ribbons, and it's derived from the bitcoin hash rate
and if you have no idea what the bitcoin hash rate is, i suggest you doing more research, because that is a very important fundamental for bitcoin
but basically, these two lines right here in the hash ribbons indicator are moving averages of the bitcoin hash rate
the green line is the 30 day simple moving average of the bitcoin hash rate, and the grade line is the 60 day simple moving average of the bitcoin hash rates
and basically any time where we see the shorter moving average, the 30day moving average, which is the green line, cross underneath the longer moving average, which is the grade line, that basically means the bitcoin hash rate is losing some of its upwards momentum
and in some cases, we could even see a slight pullback in the bitcoin hashrate
and now, in certain circumstances, this can be due to different things
for example, what we saw in the middle of last year was, of course, china been bitcoin again for i think, the fourth or the fifth time now
but anyway, in this situation, we saw a lot of bitcoin miners mining in china basically switch off their machines and relocate to other areas of the world
and during that time period right there where we saw a decent chunk of bitcoin miners switch off their machines, we saw the hash rate go down, at least in the shorter term, before then recovering later on
and now that was more of a severe pullback in the bitcoin hashrate, because we don't normally see a pullback of that size very often
because the majority of the time that we see this capitulation signal pop up in this hash ribbons indicator, it usually just means bitcoin mining profitability at the moment is lower than what it was due to the fact that the bitcoin price is obviously lower than, for example, a few months ago, and also, electricity costs might have increased
and of course, this is certainly not the first time this has happened
this has happened multiple times throughout many years worth of bitcoin's history
but basically, when the bitcoin miners are under stress during certain time periods like this in the markets, that usually means we're getting somewhat close to a bitcoin bottom
but oftentimes, in this indicator, it flashes a blue buy signal like this after a long minor capitulation, where a lot of miners might switch off their machines
and as for how long that minor capitulation could last for, it could last for just a few days, weeks, and even up to a couple months, like what we saw in the middle of last year
basically, we saw a lot of these capitulation signals and buy signals throughout 2019 and 2020
and all four of these capitulation signals eventually ended up in a blue buy signal, which, historically speaking, has been extremely accurate
just taking a quick look at some of these buy signals, we saw one right here, which was at the very end of 2019, right after we saw a capitulation around a month before then
and obviously, as soon as we saw that buy signal, we saw a decent pump in the bitcoin price by around 40 to 50 percent
and then we saw another minor capitulation just after the march 2020 crash
and then another buy signal that came after that during april 2020, which was an amazing time to accumulate bitcoin, just before another shortterm pump
and then we saw another minor capitulation right after the 2020 halving, which is this red line right here, during may 2020
and a little over a month after that, we saw another blue buy signal just before a bitcoin pump
once again, another minor capitulation followed by another blue buy signal around a month later, approximately, which resulted in a lot more bullish price action
and if you're going back even further on the chart, taking a look at what we saw in the 2018 bear market, we did not see any signal for almost that entire bear market in the hash ribbons, up until pretty much the very end of that bear market
in fact, it was right around october, november 2018 where we saw that minor capitulation signal first show up
and then we actually ended up seeing another capitulation in the bitcoin price just after that
and a couple months later, then we saw a massive blue buy signal in this hash ribbons indicator, which basically told us bitcoin is getting ready for its next massive bullish move
and if you want to know just how accurate these hash ribbon signals are for bitcoin, take a look at some previous gains and losses around the buy signals we've seen in the hash remains indicator throughout bitcoin's history
and so these were all separate times where we saw this hash ribbons indicator flash a buy signal
it's basically, once we saw the buy signal flash in that indicator, the average maximum drawdown in the bitcoin price after we saw that buy signal was just 11, another 11 drop, before then we bought them out, with the largest drop being another 45 drop after we saw the buy signal, and the smallest drop just being a one percent drop until we bottom out
and then if you're looking at the gains this signal has provided, from the buy signal to the next peak in the bitcoin price, our average maximum gain in the bitcoin price after we saw one of these buy signals in this indicator was over four thousand one hundred percent
but keep in mind, this is including a lot of early bitcoin gains, which heavily skews this average
and realistically speaking, it's unlikely we're going to see something like an 80x gain in bitcoin again
so when it comes to the gains, instead of looking at these older years and looking at the average, if we just pay attention to what's happened more recently, in just recent years, it is still totally possible to see a triple figure percentage point gain, meaning over a 100 gain, in the bitcoin price after we see one of these buy signals occur
but once again, this is after we see one of those blue buy signals pop up in this indicator, which we have not seen just yet
we're only just beginning that capitulation phase in the hash ribbons indicator, which usually lasts for at least a few weeks, and in most cases, around a month to a month and a half
and what is really interesting is all of this heavily falls in line with this bitcoin fractal, which is basically the middle of last year's bottom overlaid on top of the current bitcoin price action
and you can see right here that, aside from the small bitcoin pump that we experienced around a week ago, the bitcoin price over the past one month has been following along with this fractal extremely closely
once again, just aside from that small bitcoin pump that we saw around a week ago
so when it comes to this chance, nothing much has changed over the past few days
so if you're new to the channel and you have no idea what this means, make sure to check out some of my recent videos here on the channel
but getting into the bitcoin long positions on the bifidex exchange right now, they're still exploding to the upside into new alltime highs, which means more and more money is flowing into bitcoin long positions on this particular exchange
and this chart right here by the way, is on the daily time frame
and ever since that last low, which was basically during the middle of april, so around two months ago, we've seen roughly around 55 000 bitcoin enter new bitcoin long positions, which is equivalent to around one and a half billion us
and if you're looking at the last time we saw such a significant increase in bitcoin long positions on the beef nx exchange, that was happening during the middle of last year, especially going up towards july, which is where these long positions peaked
and obviously it was during this time period, right here, where we saw the bitcoin price bottom it out
because these long positions are obviously owned by bitcoin whales
if we're talking about billions of dollars entering into these positions, while the amount of users on this particular exchange is very low relative to other exchanges
and another sign that these are bitcoin whales is the fact that these positions did not get liquidated at all, even when the bitcoin price initially dumped down towards around 25 000 a month ago
instead, these traders simply added more money to their long positions, around a billion dollars more
but all of this is not talking about the immediate short term
instead, it's talking about around the mid to long term, talking about the next few months, maybe even the next year or so
because if you're looking at the short term bitcoin price action here, on the four hour time frame, right now, we do actually have some bearish market structure forming
because obviously, over the past one day, we've seen the bitcoin price break below that 28 and a half thousand dollar level of support
and not only that, we've actually seen a retest, coming back up and confirming that as a new resistance with a small rejection from that level
as i mentioned in my last bitcoin update video, that we saw that happened for this 29 and a half thousand dollar level of support
and so right now, that 28 and a half thousand dollar level should be acting as new resistance, as we already have pretty much one confirmation of resistance along that level so far
and as for some other levels of support, i'll be looking at our fibonacci retracement tour
we do have the golden pocket, which is sitting at around 27 and a half thousands but recently, at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price has been chopping either side of that golden pocket
so really i'll be looking towards the 786 percent fibonacci level coming in at around 267 k, as another important level of support
and anything below that, i'll be looking towards that 25k low
and now getting into the ethereum parts of this video, this right here is the weekly ethereum chart
and right now, the rsi on the weekly time frame is entering into oversold territories, as i mentioned yesterday
but we have the next weekly candle close coming up in just a couple hours from now, at the time of recording this video
and so if we see the weekly ethereum rsi underneath a value of 30 when it comes time for that weekly candle close in just a couple hours, then that will basically confirm the fact that the weekly ethereum rsi has entered into oversold territories, which has only ever happened just one other time throughout ethereum's entire price history, which was at the end of the 2018 bear markets
and if you're zooming into the price action that we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market
and what we saw in the weekly ethereum rsi during that same time period, as i said, the weekly ethereum rsi entered into oversold territories
but keep in mind the first week where we saw a weekly kennel close and the rsi underneath a value of 30, meaning it was oversold
that was right here, after this significant red weekly candle
and at that time, right there, we still had another three more weeks before then we actually hit the bottom for the bear market, because the rsi went a little bit lower than just 30
but whether you bought ethereum at around 110 or at around 80 to 90 dollars, it wouldn't have made much difference
like i said, over the next couple weeks, ethereum still dumped back in 2018
and now taking a look at the short term ethereum price action
here on the six hour chart, we have almost hit the technical price target for this pattern, coming in at around 1 400
in fact, at the time of recording this video, the price of ethereum has gotten within around 20 of this technical price target
because obviously, if you've been on the channel over the past few days, you'll know that right around here, i was letting you know that i was targeting 14 k for this break to the downside
and now, considering the fact that ethereum has had a fairly significant drop in recent days, i'd mostly expect some sort of sideways consolidation range to form for ethereum over the next few days, something like this, for example
because usually after a significant drop, the price needs some time to stabilize
and that is usually in the form of some sort of sideways consolidation range like this
once again, and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum short positions on the bivnx exchange
and today they are back to closing again, almost back down to alltime low levels
and if you're new to the channel and you have no idea what this means for ethereum, definitely watch some of my recent ethereum updates here on the channel
and the same could be said about ethereum versus bitcoin and the bitcoin dominance, which are very important for old coin holders out there
but once again, over the past one to two days, nothing much has changed

in today's video, i'm going to be talking about bitcoin, elliott wave theory
i'm going to be talking about what we've seen so far in bitcoin's prior bull runs based on elliott wave theory
we're going to be talking about what we can expect next based on previous trends
and we're going to be wrapping things up talking about how have these previous trends panned out, and if they are still playing out as they previously did, where can we expect bitcoin to bottom? let's jump right into today's video
so let's start off with what is elliott wave theory? so if we paste in the elliott wave theory cheat sheet, a lot of you may not know this, but you can simply copy and paste images over into trading view
now, elliott wave theory is the theory that markets move in waves
so you can see waves one, three and five, are odd numbers, and these are all bullish impulses
between these bullish impulses, we have what are known as correctory waves
if i remove this, you can see from wave one down to wave two, this is our correctory wave
so the even numbers, once again, the even numbers are the correctory phases, and the odd numbers, like one, three and five, are the impulses
now, what happens after you have your fifth impulse? now, if you are in a bullish trend, or even if you're in a bearish trend, you have either an abc correction to the upside or the downside
specifically for bitcoin, bitcoin has been on a macro bull run basically since its inception, since, you know, 2011
but this is the chart that we are running over on bitstamp to look at basically the first three bull runs so far that bitcoin has had into an existence
what happens is, as you can see, just like it is theorized over on the elliott wave theory, we have, you know, a massive impulse up to wave one, correctory phase, wave two
and then you find your bottom, and you can go on a another rally to the upside
so bear in mind, if you are new to elliott wave theory, we're specifically going to be looking at how elliott wave theory works to the upside
so for example, you can see these big waves on the one, three and five, you have microwaves between them
so for example, on your one impulse, your free impulse and your five impulse
as these are bullish waves, you have a five wave up into them
so you can see a one, two, three, four, five wave coming up into the one wave
and then coming down into the two wave, you have an a, b c correction
coming up into the second bullish impulse wave, also known as the third wave, you have your one, two, three, four, five coming down into your correctory phase once again, which, uh, the second correctory phase is the four wave
and then coming up into your last macro bullish impulse, which is the five wave, you have your one, two, three, four, five, coming up to the top of the uh
we're completing the market structure for the bullish impulse part of the elliott wave theory
now, what happens when you come up to five, when you are in a bullish wave? well, you come down and have a macro a, b, c correction
and within these macro abc corrections, you have one impulsive wave back up to the upside
but this is mainly focused on coming down, having your correctory wave a, having a dead cat bounce, basically up to b, and then having your correctory phase down to c, which typically always lands between the free wave and the one wave
and we're going to be talking about how that is panned out in previous cycles for elliott wave theory
now we should know what elliot wave theory is, so i'm now going to remove this
i want to show you just a small, smaller example of some elliott wave theory that we've had in this market cycle, before we do move on
so for example, you can see this is where the, uh, the macro market structure started over on btc
so you can see in this bull run, you had your one wave coming into 2019
and the five wave was very, very underwhelming in this market cycle
very com very, very underwhelming compared to every other marketplace we've had as well
we came up to the five wave up here, as you can see, we've got these three impulses
and what happens when you have these three impulses to the upside? well, like we said, you have your one, two, three, four, five waves
and then you come down to your correctory phases, which are waves two and four
so once we come down to wave two, you can see we have a big a, b, c correction coming up into wave three
you've got your one, two, three, four, five, coming down to your correctory wave, uh, correctory wave four
it's kind of hard to see with this one, on the last one, but we were just slightly above the impulse of the free wave over here
and then this gets to the structure that we're witnessing at this moment in time
because, as i'm sure all of you are aware, unless you've been sleeping underneath a rock, then i'm sure you're very aware, that bitcoin has been in a massive cascade for the past year or so
and within that, as we've completed this five wave in my opinion, obviously, um, one thing i should probably state about elliott wave theory is there is a high level of ambiguity to this, meaning that it is very subjective
like if you put two people in a room with a chart and you tell them draw elliott wave theory, you're bound to have some slight differences
so for example, you might use elliott wave fear, and you might have drawn this slightly different than me
i know that some people, uh, drew a big abc, abc, and then something like an abc over here
however, you can still have abc waves into corrections, uh, on the macro abc
so for example, if we do clear this chart up for a minute, let me make sure i can get that back
so i know a lot of people on this wave have got your a, b, c, obviously, in my opinion, and i imagine in most people's opinions, we have not finished the c wave yet
but within these minor moves, uh, what i have drawn, i believe we had the one, two, three, four, five
i know that some people have drawn this as a, a, b and c, and i completely understand why, because we've been landsliding pretty fast, and from here to here, it really wasn't too much of an impulse
and then from down here to here, i mean, this, this is where it starts making sense a lot more
but i believe it's specifically within this region where we didn't have too much of a bounce, which is why i see people drawing this like an abc
and then to the upside as well, they've also drawn it like an abc
like i said, there is a high level of ambiguity when you are drawing these elliott waves
with that being said, uh, i specifically want to talk about finishing off with the micro moves that we are having at this moment in time, because i think we're gearing up for that last move to the downside, as we previously talked about, within this bullish market structure, you had your, uh, you had your one impulse
uh, after you had the bottom in 2018, you had your two free impulse, correctory wave five impulse
and as we previously stated, when you do have your five impulses, when you're done with your five impulses, it is time to have that macro, a, b, c correction
and you can see why what i really want to focus on is the correctory waves
uh, so sure, you know, you have the abc correction up to the b wave
but more specifically, you have your one, two, three, four five down to your first correctory wave, abc
and then another one, two, three, four five coming down to the c wave
and in my opinion, the c wave, i i believe, at least according to elliott wave theory, this, you know, bear in mind, uh, my specific price target, if you look at my other bitcoin videos, my my target at this moment in time, is the 200 week moving average
if you want to learn about, you know why i think the 200week moving average is where we should be targeting
remember, when you're moving to the downside in abc, it's no longer a micro abc
this is what happens when you have, uh, these correctory waves within a bullish impulse
so within that we have a one wave, two wave, three wave, four wave and five wave
and then, once again, you can see a, b, c, and then coming down, one, two, three, four, and i believe five, at least according to elliott wave theory, is going to be coming around 20 000 or so
now, i think it's very, very clear, uh, specifically, you know, we can switch over to the daily, but i actually think it's, it's very, very clear
even on the weekly time frame, you know, you can see this big, big move down
and then you you can clearly see that from this low down here, at 39 000, this move up to 43 000, was definitely somewhat of a significant impulse
and then, i obviously don't need to tell you, this freeway of this giant free wave is a very, very clear free wave all the way back down to 25 300
we then have our correctory impulse back to the upside, which leads us up to 32 500
and in my opinion, we have already seen that last correctory wave to the upside, and now we should be looking at our bearish impulse to the downside
so bear in mind, you know, when you're having this abc correction, your a is your bearish, uh, impulse to the downside
but when you're in, you know, the eight, you when you're in the one, two, three, four, five, to the upside, you know, this would be your bullish impulse
and then you flip it on its head when you are having that abc correction, you do come down to those lower prices
so let's now move over, uh, to basically the final segment of the video
i want to look at how elliott wave theory has previously panned out in other trends
i believe that we are going to be coming down somewhere around about these ranges, at least according to elliott wave theory
now, when you do look at how elliott wave theory pans out, um, once again, i'm, i'm not gonna do a super, super deep dive talking about, uh, on elliott waves and all of those, uh, all of those other stuffs
if you do want me to do a even deeper, advanced guide into elliott wave theory, uh, do let me know
i will definitely consider it if that is what other people are, um, you know, wanting to hear
but as in my opinion, before i made this video, i didn't think that that would be the general consensus, that people would want to watch an even longer video with more advanced talk on fibs, on um, on impulses and fibs on correctory waves and all of that stuff
so if you do want an advanced elliott wave theory video, let me know
apart from that, i won't mention it again if no one mentions it
but as you can see, most of the time we are generalizing, but between the one and the free wave is normally the place where you do bottom on elliott wave theory
so once again, you have your one bullish impulse, you have your free bullish impulse, and you have your five bullish impulse
and when you have your abc correction, you typically, you typically come back between the three wave and the front and the five wave
this was, uh, this was your free wave over here on bitcoin, right at the top
so once again, um, one, two, three, four, five, this was your free wave up here
so hypothetically speaking, we should bottom between the one wave and the free wave
where is the bottom of the one wave? well, the one wave actually over here, is coming in approximately 14 000, which is absolutely brutal
now, in my opinion, i don't think we're gonna be going all the way down to the one wave
i think the moving averages say it would be completely outlandish, i think, you know, although market sentiment is pretty crazy at this moment in time, and i don't want to, you know, dive too deep, uh, off the scale of the elliott wave theory, but just, you know, without explaining, i do not think that we would be coming as low as 14 000
and i know this is very, very, uh, unspecific, uh, specifically, because from where we are now, this is a big range between 27 000 and 14 000
but let's look at previous trends and see if we can notice anything about our c correctory waves
now let's take it all the way back to the start, to when we had our bull run, topping out in 2013
i don't know why we don't, you know, put more specific dates on this, because this really started in 2011
nonetheless, where did we bottom? we had our one, impulse 2 correctory wave, free impulse 4, correct we weigh 5 wave
and if i draw this back, you can see we bottomed at approximately 150 dollars
bear in mind, i am, you know, looking at this on the weekly time frame, so i'm probably going to fat finger the prices a tiny bit
you know, bear in mind this, we are looking at these general macro moves
we're not trying to say, you know, specifically, we bottomed 1499624
so your free wave of this ball cycle was up here, free wave, and then your one wave was all the way down here
so when we did have this c correction, we came absolutely nowhere near, um, we came nowhere near the one wave
and i do not want to do something like measure the distance between them because the market cap of bitcoin was exceptionally low back here
it is factual that there have been diminished returns playing out market cycle with a market cycle
if you do also want me to do a video explaining the diminished returns theory, let me know
i'm always interested in branching out and providing more uh educational resources for the community
nonetheless, if you have any ideas, and just a tiny tidbit from this, i do have a full educational playlist
uh, there's a ton of things, everything from how to use fibonaccis, how to use moving average, how to how to calculate death crosses, how to use hikonashi candles
and i do plan on expanding this out, and i'm probably going to make a separate video about how to use elliott wave theory within there
if you do have any more suggestions for that list, then let me know
but what do you know? once again, c wave blossomed just below the free wave
we had our c wave at the approximate value of three thousand one hundred
and what do you notice? we actually bottomed exactly, basically exactly on the free wave
so we bottomed, this was the top of the free wave, and we bottomed right here
so what you'll actually notice is we bottomed above the free wave, which was very, very impressive in my opinion
you know, like i said, traditionally, an elliott wave theory, you normally bottom between the free wave and the one wave, which should, you know, be the range between this wave here and this wave here, which is, once again, your free wave and your one wave
and the distance between these two over here would be, zoom out, your free wave, free wave right here, rather all the way back down to your one wave
so in both market cycles, we bottomed a very, very close valuation to the free wave
in the first market cycle, we capitulated below the free wave, and we blossomed very, very close to the three wave
so what we can say from the first market structure is we held both the one wave and we held the four wave, and we were close to the freeway
so the second market structure, after we had our abc correction, we not only held the free wave, uh, once again, we held the four wave
what should we expect if we are coming over into this market cycle? because you can see we've got our one wave, two, three, four and five
unfortunately, we have deviated from the previous trends, because this was your four wave correction right here
and in previous cycles, this was the range that we, we always held
and it's, it's interesting to see that we are moving below it
even accounting for diminished returns, uh, diminished returns doesn't necessarily affect the market structure of elliott waves
you know, diminished returns would simply mean that if you've got, you know, a massive, massive cycle, and then obviously, you know, this is your first ball run, you have an a b, a b c correction between the free wave and the one wave, it would simply mean that, you know, it doesn't mean that the market structure is going to change at all
it simply means that, you know, the next rally is probably just not going to be as euphoric as the first one
and then if you do have, you know, your a b c correction, you should once again bottom at the approximate value between the free wave and the one wave
and at this moment in time, you can see the one wave is really the only thing that we have holding the market structure up at this moment in time because, you know, you can see one wave, two wave, of course, but i think it's completely degenerative to even assume that we would be heading down to four thousand dollars
anyway, but nonetheless, um, the one wave is really all we've got at this moment in time because one, two, your free wave was over
all the way up here at sixty four thousand, i don't need to tell you, that's not gonna hold
uh, the full wave, which was the correctory phase down here, was around twenty seven 000
so the only thing we have to hold the market up at this moment in time is the one wave down here
and once again, i ha, i have to very much emphasize that i do not think we would be coming all the way down to the one wave
once again, i've been saying that in elliott wave fear, you typically bottom between the range of the free wave and the one wave
because if we do look at the cheat sheet, or, you know, you can go back to the cheat sheet before, in the cheat sheet, we come down to the one wave in bitcoins
previous bull cycles, we've always bottomed at slash around the freeway
so very interesting to note, once again, the next leg down for us at this moment in time would be approximately another 49 move so that is elliott wave theory
this is what, according to elliott wave theory, is likely to happen, based on previous trends
now, once again, i do not think that we're gonna be coming down to the one wave
i do think, if anything, once again, this has nothing to do with elliott wave theory, but i think the most likely scenario is for us to either bottom at the 200 week moving average, which i will quickly display to you
but if you, once again, if you do want my, uh, full indepth sports of, you know, kind of why i think bitcoin is coming down to this level, you can check out my previous bitcoin videos in the past couple of days
um, but nonetheless, the free wave, if this does converge up? because i imagine we're not just going to drop like a rock down to this next week
so let's assume that this converges to the upside for the next couple of weeks
that is my minimum price target at this moment in time for bitcoin
and i do also think it's possible we could come down to 19690, which was the previous alltime high
we could even quickly capitulate to 19k before bouncing back out of here
and once again, this is not even really what elliott wave theory is predicting
elliott wave theory once again predicts that if you are going to have your correctory bottom, it should be between the one wave and the free wave, which is between these ranges over here
obviously, because we've come down to this phase, this is where we should expect the bottom on the elliott wave theory
once again, i just wanted to give you an update on the yellow elliott wave theory
i personally do not think we're going to be coming down to these levels
how is everyone doing today? hope you're having a fantastic saturday
make sure to absolutely crush that like button on your way in
we're going to analyze the situation here today, saturday, on bitcoin, see what is going on
we are going to take a look at today's daily close, because if today's daily close does manage to close below this level over here, which is exactly the twenty eight thousand five hundred and eighty dollars, approximately, which we are very close in closing below this range, just a few hours left
but if we do close this below this level, it is very likely going to continue to the downside to fill this massive, big wick that we do have on the daily, on the weekly chart, we've also got this massive wick, okay? we usually like to, you know, fill these wicks
so it does look like that we do break these major levels, these major support ranges, okay, which is the 28 580 where we do have these daily closes
look how many times we did struggle here in breaking this level
if this daily does close successfully below this range, then it's very, very likely going to have this continuation to the downside in the next, you know, couple of days, three days to fill this this wick
okay? we are very likely going to retest this low at the 25 000 region
of course, we're usually waiting for that big break up from a major support level
guys, remember yesterday we were talking about this major support level on the, on the video update where, you know, if we did break out successfully from this range, you know, we did have some pretty powerful four hourly candle closers below this major level
look how perfectly we came all the way up early, early this morning to retest it, okay? and then had that correction
i did not take the short of course, but you probably did, if you are paying attention to these major levels
okay, to the successful breakout, you know that it will, that was a a winning train, but winning trade basically where we have broken out from this huge, major support level
okay, below this range, you can see it's a very, very solid breakout
early this morning, we came all the way back up here to retest the 29 300 range, slightly above, getting that rejection from this level
okay? coming back down to retest the lows and actually breaking down
early this morning, it was actually around about six o'clock in the morning
i have no trades open on bitcoin, or on on prime xbt on the other markets
i'm gonna get my week ready, because on monday, gonna start crushing the charts, of course, if we do
if we do, of course, continue back down, and then we do have a pretty solid correction
of course, a pretty solid bounce all the way back up here to this twenty eight thousand five hundred, twenty eight thousand six hundred dollar range
okay, we are going to get this a little bit of a reaction at this level
this is a major, major zone, okay? that if we do come back up, all right, before coming down to retest this low range after 25 000, if we do have that pull back, it isn't going to be another good opportunity to get back in, because this is very, very likely going to create a lower high
we'll be getting resistance, okay, just to have that continuation to the downside
but what i do also think that this is going to come down pretty pretty fast
reason why is because we don't have much, okay, of volume here
so once we start breaking this range, this drop can be pretty aggressive
okay, so you need to pay attention to that kind of price action
okay, very, very likely that we are going to come down, all right now, trading at these ranges
all right? very, very likely that the continuation to the downside on bitcoin is going to happen
i want to know in the comment section if you are bullish or if you are bearish for the next couple of weeks on bitcoin
and i'm going to say hello quickly through the comment section also
are you bearish on bitcoin the coming weeks? guys, uh, because just about, what was it? i'm not sure if it was about four or five days ago, i was asking people if they were bullish
and i think there was quite some people that were bullish on bitcoin
you know, a lot of people were calling for that 35 000 range when we were trading at these levels
people are like, you know, we're gonna have that leg up to 30
i was very, very undecisive inside of this, you know, descending triangle scenario
are you bearish on bitcoin the coming weeks? let me know guys
let's see how many votes we're going to get and see if there's more people bullish or bearish
i was taking a look at polkadot today, also very interesting thing
um olu bender, hello, uh, juan torres, to zero? bitcoin to zero? i don't think so
uh, what's up, my crypto legend, that's crypto al how are you doing? uh, still holding to my, uh, to my at least 25k? uh? says william, yes, absolutely
i do think that, you know, it is just very likely that bitcoin is gonna come down to those levels, all right, in the next coming days
uh, we're just about to lose the the biggest support level from this, you know, trading range that we've had for the last 25, you know, even 30 days, since we had that drop here on the 11th, 12th of may, as you can see on the chart
so if we do lose this major low, which is very, very likely to be lost, okay, in the next, you know, couple of days, it might be by monday, uh, maybe weekend, we might going to see a little bit of relief rally, a little bit of a sideways action
um, but like i said, you know, it's just about to lose this most important level from this range, uh, from this range
because if we do lose this, twenty eight thousand five hundred, twenty eight thousand six hundred, you know, these levels successfully, okay, you can have a little bit of that volatility
but if you do have that breakout, you know, coming slightly lower, have those solid, you know, a couple of hour candles, you know, uh, closing below, well below the 28 500 then, of course, this is going to have a pretty, pretty aggressive drop to retest the 25 000 area
let's take, let's think about waves, because waves did have a very interesting scenario, but i would stay extremely cautious on waves at these levels
now we were talking on waves, you know, to potentially, you know, get a major support from this range
but i would be very, very much aware with waves at this moment
and i do think, i do think bitcoin is gonna have, you know, that test at the low 25 000 area and potentially break it, okay, but at least coming down to retest it in the next coming days
it's just almost imminent at these levels, okay? we're just about to lose the last major support from the range
so if we do take a look at waves, and we do probably see, uh, you know, a bullish case scenario, okay, where where we might see the the price getting a bounce
if bitcoin starts to drop in a few thousand dollars, all right, in the next coming days, it is going to drag most of the all coins down
so i do see, you know, waves, you know, this potential trade, this potential consolidation that we were going to have at this range
um, it's just maybe not gonna, it's not gonna, maybe worth the risk
okay, you probably want to even short it if bitcoin is going to drop, but only if bitcoin were to look bullish
we were talking about, uh, waves a few days ago, where we had a big, massive pump with huge amount of volume, okay? and, um, yeah, basically we were looking for that potential, you know, continuation, you know, maybe a start of an uptrend here on waves, creating a higher low
bitcoin does look it it's going to have that leg down to that 25 000 area in the next coming days
so, yeah, we would be looking for bearish trades, not bullish ones
um, i had someone in the telegram group asking me, you know, are you going to trade waves, you know, at these levels? and i'm saying, well, all depends on bitcoin, because now would be the potential range
okay, at this consolidation, you know, you're slightly below the 618 from this level
if you start consolidating, it will be looking pretty exciting for a potential long, for the retest of the highs
but like i say on most of the videos, on most other live streams, you know, you need to take, first of all, you need to take a look at bitcoin, because depending on how bitcoin is looking, then, i i am all depending on the trading setup for the altcoins
but like i said, you know, bitcoins bearish, even though we consolidate here sideways, and we are going to look here for bitcoin to come to lower levels
um, yeah, i would, i would stay away here for for that potential long
because ethereum has lost, you know, the summer lows of 2021, a big, major support level
but we were talking about, you know, ethereum losing, you know, losing this big, big, major level, then it's very likely going to come down to actually retest the alltime highs, all right? of um, of back of 2020, of back of 2018
and this is a major, major zone where we did have a large consolidation here on ethereum
okay, we had a pretty large resistance consolidation where we finally had that big, massive breakout, came back down and got that beautiful bounce here from the old time high of 2018, getting that beautiful bounce, as you can see here, in march of 2021
so this is that major, this is that that major, big level? okay, if i do, take a look at ethereum, right over here, our next major, big level here on the vpvr
you know i was talking about, you know, if we do lose the 1700 range, the price action is gonna move pretty pretty fast, all the way down to 1 400 area, where we do have this big, major support range and big resistance, as you can see
and we have a pretty large gap on the vpvr from the volume traded of 2021 and 2022
you can see, this is all about one and a half years, about 18 months, approximately, of um of price action
you know, this is the one of the main reasons why you are dropping quite fast
i wasn't expecting ethereum to drop as fast, um, but yeah, it's having a pretty aggressive drop from this level we were talking about, you know, this descending triangle scenario on ethereum, big, massive support here
what does decentral descending triangles are mainly bearish patterns, right where you where you do have the the selling pressure, okay, pushing the price down, making those lower highs, as you can see here, okay, on on the chart
so this is the scenario that we've had for ethereum for the last few weeks, creating those lower highs, creating a, a big low, which is the one thousand seven hundred dollars, and then creating the lower highs every single time, you know, respecting the resistance on the trend line
this is a, you know, a textbook technical analysis, all right, descending triangle, where you do have a solid level at the 1 700 range, and you're creating aggressive lower highs
now, there is a projected move from this descending triangle, of course
now, the ideal scenario would have been, you know, would be, you know, in the next coming, you know, hours, days, if we were to get that retracement, a big retracement to these levels
it is possible, you know, that is is very likely going to be a very good shorting opportunity
if you do get that consolidation, if you do get that leg up on ethereum
are we going to manage to pump um, you know, 170 or 150 dollars approximately, to hit that 1 700 range? you know, this is a huge, huge resistance
in the summer of 2021, we had three big, major bouncers, okay, one here on the on the 23rd of may
here, also on the 23rd of june, and the last one on the 20th of july, when, you know, bitcoin and a lot of the cryptos were starting to pump like crazy
you know, this level has been so, so strong, so respected as support that if you do see the price coming up, all right, in the next coming days, uh, with so, you know, some miracle, yeah, getting that big, big retracement, you know, i'm not sure if it's going to happen, and we're probably just going to consolidate sideways and continue back down
but it would be the ideal scenario, because this is such a strong, strong level on ethereum, that if you do get that pullback, okay, that you know, come back up to this range, that 1700, 1680, then it would be absolutely ideal
um, but, yeah, i would be focusing on fibonacci levels, of course
i would take this high from the drop, or this actual level over here
um, yeah, you could probably take, i mean, this is the thing, you're probably going to continue back down
but if you start correcting from this, if you start having a relief rally from these levels on on ethereum, okay
if we were to have the relief rally and consolidate in the next, you know, couple of hours, you know, a few days, uh, and then we would be looking at that 50 financial retracement from the start of this big, major drop that happened, you know, the last couple of days
and also, the six one eight, the six one eight is exactly at the one thousand seven hundred dollar range from the start of this major drop, looking at the one hourly
um, so, yeah, it would be, it would be the ideal scenario in between 1, 640, 1660, sorry, which is the 50 fibonacci, and the 6181, 700, it would be absolutely ideal there to get that next lower high that, you know, get the balls, you know, get get that next impulse to have a big, massive drop
i mean, this is the thing, we might just continue back down there
of course, the textbook technical analysis projected move from a descending triangle is the is the back, okay, of the descending triangle, from the consolidation from the breakout, you could have that projected move that could take us down to that 1 400, 1 300 range
so expect ethereum to be trading down those levels in the next coming days
now, question is, you know, are we going to get that opportunity of potentially getting into trade here on this retracement and consolidate? because that is very, very likely going to get rejected
are we just going to consolidate, continue to the downside? all right, in the next coming days, also to reach that big, big, big support level, where i do expect ethereum will be getting a huge, huge bounce, like i showed you here on the vpvr, that's super important
vpvr, like, uh, we we get big, big, major bouncers um from these extreme levels
uh, taking a look look at the last 18 months traded, we can see, you know, these levels, these spikes are very much respected, these spikes on the vpvr are very much respected
and we start to have big, big, big volume on vpvr at the 1 300, 1 400 area
so this is a very, very likely level that will be holding, you know, we will be having that relief rally, uh, on at those levels
uh, are we gonna have, you know, that opportunity in in creating a lower high and continue back down? probably yes
um, so, yeah, not much to add here on ethereum, hey, what's up? andy? pandy, lauren, how are you doing? illusion hello
if you haven't signed up for my team, i think we're over 40 people already right now on the world series of trading, which is absolutely insane
uh, let me just double check here, because i do think that we are round about 40 people, which is more than i expected
if you haven't signed up on buy bit, you've got an insane bonus
okay, you can join the with the link down below, and also the telegram group, only exclusively for the people that are going to join for the competition
and the competition starts on the 27th of june, till the 17th of july
okay, but if you want to join, you know, uh, you are more than welcome, absolutely
we'll be, we are going to focus from the 27th in doing extreme technical analysis and getting into those big trading opportunities
i am going to start the, you know, the the analysis on the 24th, 25th, start getting things ready, sending it on the telegram group
okay, looking for those big, big levels where we're going to take some potential opportunities
and of course, you can share also your knowledge and think where there might be some good, good levels to take some trades on those cryptos that can be traded on by bit
okay, so make sure to join the competition if you are willing to give a hundred percent
and the the weekly will, uh, weekly with moving average at 200 shows that it could uh dip all the way to, uh, 22k
i'm not much of a moving average guy, but, yeah, i can take it out right now, the moving average
and, yeah, i'm not sure who was talking about the moving average, but let me just, yeah, we will pull it out here one second
so let me just just take that moving average here and show it
i mean, moving average doesn't indicate that you need to go to those levels, of course, um, [Music]
but, yeah, it does, you know, potentially indicate that it's a very, very strong support range
this is the, this is the 200 weekly moving average right here
okay? where you do see, you know, yeah, it's an average level
so, i mean, just because it has held here, or we've come down here and also held here
i mean, this has to hold in some kind of matter, because it's just the average moving, you know, the average trend on bitcoin is going up
so you can potentially dip down below this moving average and continue back up
so it's not a very, it's not something that is, is, is really reliable
and then then what you're gonna say, um, i think it's just something that's not not too reliable, uh? but yeah, i do think that bitcoin can come down to the 22k levels, absolutely
so anyway, let's take a look here through the comment section, and let's see if we want to take a look at some more cryptos
uh, it's gonna, very likely gonna come down and retest these lows
i'm not sure if we do have some analysis here, yeah, uh, basically we're looking at this over here on on gala, coming down to retest these low levels, the lows that we did create on the 12th of may, basically, yeah
we have broken a major support level over here, creating those lower highs, as you can see, lower high, lower height, lower higher
we actually tried an attempt to get above this high, failed miserably, of course
and now breaking the low levels, gala is very, very likely going to come down to the, you know, that three, four cent level in the next coming days
especially if we are going to see that bearish momentum on bitcoin
if we do see gala having a nice retracement, which is very, very possible to happen in the next coming hours and a couple of days, check out this
we did have a major resistance level here back when we had this major drop
okay, so on the 12th of may, we were in the 13th of may, we had this major resistance at the seven cent level
and also, once we came back up, it reacted as super strong support right over here, as you can see on the chart
this was actually the early this morning, early this morning we broke this level
we got that reaction here again, but the selling pressure was too much
we are in this kind of descending, you know, triangle kind of scenario, of course
if we do see gala coming back up to that seven cent level, and we have a little bit of a consolidation, we have a couple of half an hour candles, one hourly candles, seven cent level
i'm actually going to put an alarm here, exactly at the 67 cents
i'm gonna add an alert because i would be very interested in trading this
the probabilities in gala coming back down here to the three four cent level is, you know, extremely likely
and what is the good thing about bitcoin? you know, if you are expecting here with analysis, that bitcoin is going to come down to retest the 25 000 level
i'm gonna actually ask this to the community, because i strongly believe that, you know, the 25 000 level will be retested in the coming days
it might take a week or so, you know, who knows, you know, with timing, exact timing
but you know, just by looking at, you know, this spring point here of resistance and just breaking this major support level, then, of course, yeah, it's just very likely it's going to come down
are you bearish on bitcoin at the coming weeks? and, yeah, 69 percent of people say yes
um, so yeah, it was very, very likely that, um, most of the people were going to be bearish
let me take a look here at, uh, the super chat here one second
give me a super chat for, um, you know, supporting for smashing the like button
also, um, best investment on earth, sheba says, priest of crypto
they do have a huge team, and they want to make shiva, okay, uh, something, something massive, something huge
we were taking a look at gala, guys, and gala does really look interesting
okay, at this level, uh, for a short i mean, if we do have that bounce to that seven cent level, or slightly above, below, you know, slightly below that range, six point eight cents, we're currently at six point three cents
if we do have that relief rally in the next coming hours, couple of days, it's going to be looking very, very, very good for a short position
it might another leg up, okay? it might have a little bit of volatility, of course
uh, or we might either consolidate here, create a kind of a bear flag, because this is also what we can see on on gala
if we start consolidating, creating a bear flag or slightly lower highs, it's just going to be a another opportunity to get into
of course, don't chase in, because, you know, shorting from here would, would, you know, wouldn't make sense
will you be well off in the next coming days? potentially, yes
remember that you do have an insane bonus for all of those experienced traders down below on buybit, up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus to be claimed
and also 30 days worth, you know, you have, you pay zero percent, make a fee for 30 days if you sign up with the link in the description
join my team, because i'm going to be 24 7 analyzing the opportunities
i really want to make something good out of the competition, and it'd be at least in the top 10
okay, winning the competition is going to be very, very difficult
there are some very, very good, uh, traders out there and big, big teams
but, you know, being in the top 10 is definitely a goal that i want to try and achieve
chart says, i know, yeah, i did ethereum, just 10 minutes after starting the live stream
so i want to take a look at some other cryptos for the community
you know, this needs a lot of sideways action and a lot of retests of the lows
and as soon as you start retesting the lows, you know, in going sideways, then you could say that this is looking strong
okay, when you see this kind of momentum in the next coming months
now, there has been a pretty good shorting opportunity here on on rsr, just a couple of days ago
and we do see that we are on aggressive, you know, lower, lower highs and lower lows
and, you know, we're having these massive waves here, as you can see
i mean, this is the thing with these all coins, i don't usually trade these all coins because, um, i like the consolidations in bitcoin
a lot of the times, if you are quick and you are aggressive, you know, all coins off are very aggressive traders
um, there was a big, big support level retested as as resistance on the 8th of july, on the 7th of july, actually, it was a quick short, shorting opportunity on on rsr
it looks strong, you say, and i think, uh, yeah, it has a little bit of a bullish momentum in the short term, but remember, we are in a very, very aggressive downtrend
we just got rejected a few days ago from this, uh, major level
you know, if you did short this major support turning into resistance on rsr, you know, you you are definitely in some pretty nice gains from this short position
it did drop 30, over 30 percent, you know, already, from this major retest support turning into resistance
now, it might look strong inside of this correction, but i think, you know, these these pumps, this these relief rises, when you want to potentially get in, because it is likely to have a continuation to the downside and retest the lows
so, yeah, uh, you you want to look for shorts at these levels
you want to be looking for shorts at these ranges, um, in my personal opinion, of course
uh, let's zoom in on the two hourly on rsr and just take a look at, you know, this this, you know, pretty strong uptrend that it has got that is very, very likely to be broken in the next coming days
okay? we have a big, massive rejection here on the resistance
as soon as we start breaking this major uptrend, losing this major low here at, um, the 000 75 cent level, it's just going to lose it
this is exactly the point, 0 0 75, the last, the last higher low range, basically where you do have, you know, look at these, look at these little major resistance, how they are respecting as support
look at this, this point, zero, zero seventy five on rsr with a big level
you know, back you you i had a massive pump, came down to the range, bounce and bounce
if we do lose this level, yeah, expect rsr to have that major correction
this is just a small uptrend, relief rally, until we have that retest of the lows here at the point zero, zero 37, which is the lows of may
um, andy, can you take a look at ether? yeah, we've taken a look at ethereum
i get a lot of people, you know, repeating the cryptocurrency
i have checked out ethereum, uh, just about 10, 15 minutes ago
i do not want to take a look at the cryptos, you know, two, three, four times
you know, two times is fine, just because there's more people out there at this moment on the stream
but, like i said, on ethereum, we have, we have broken the strongest level on ethereum from 2021 and 2022
okay? that 1 700, that was a huge, huge support back here in 2021
okay, bouncing every single time the entire summer, having that massive rally, afterwards, in august, of course
and then, you know, we've been bouncing in may also from this range
so it has been very, very strongly respected, very likely that the ethereum price will be pushing down to 1 400, even 1 300, in the next coming days
okay, from the volume traded for the last, you know, 18 months approximately, we have a very, very big gap in volume
and this is why we are falling really aggressively, really aggressively right now
if we start losing this level successfully, you know, this drop is going to happen in days, potentially all the way down to the 1 400, 1 400, you know
and below that range is the target of this descending triangle
okay, pattern, you want to take a look at textbook technical analysis, you know, targets the projected move from a consolidation inside of a descending triangle
you have in the selling pressure creating lower highs, lower highs, lower highs
and then you have a base as support, which is the 1700, getting those bounces the entire month of may, finally breaking it here in june, as you can see
so, if we are lucky on on ethereum, you know, like i said, you know, this, the ideal trade scenario here for ethereum would be coming all the way up to the 1700
now, you could speculate in this, you know, breaking down from this zone
you know, you we were talking about this for the last few days, you know, that ethereum is in a descending triangle
you know, this is usually a bearish pattern, and it's very, very probable you're just gonna break support level
so, you know, you can anticipate getting into that short position, uh, obviously, you know, uh, just yesterday or, you know, two days ago
but the ideal scenario would be getting, you know, that nice retracement
and that nice retracement would be coming all the way here to the one 1700, six hundred and eighty, approximately
and, you know, taking a look at fib levels from the exact start of the of the of the drop, which would be after this major consolidation, we are looking at that fifty percent and six one eight, which is this 1660, 1700
you know, that is the moment i would potentially step in for a trade here on ethereum, uh, continuation to the downside
you know, from the breakout, we are coming down to the retest at 1400, 300 range, you know, in the next coming days
you know, it might be a week, it might be two weeks, all depending on on, you know, the the consolidation, the retracements that we have, but it's very, very likely going to come down to the, to that level
so you don't want to do much more of ethereum, smash that like guys and girls
bitcoin dominance is absolutely skyrocketing by the looks of things
i mean, this is, this is the thing, it's actually breaking another resistance zone
i was expecting a a kind of sideways action or consolidation at this level on the bitcoin dominance, but the fear is real
this is when you have a lot of different youtubers, okay? um, you know, also talking about major, old coins that are not going to be nothing
you know, all coins are still just a bunch of speculation defy, you know, not talking about memes, you know, and metaverse projects
and people are understanding this right now, and they prefer moving their money, their all coins, okay? their their dollars, from all coins into bitcoin
i actually didn't check this for the last few days, and we've had a huge, massive pump, going from 47 all the way above 48 right now, just jumping one percent in one day, which is, which is huge
that is a a pretty interesting, uh, large amount of billions of dollars
you know, the bearish trend is very likely to continue for the next 6 to 18 months
this doesn't mean we will have big relief rallies, because we will
we will have big, big relief rallies, but we'll still be in this bearish market situation
i remember people getting extremely, extremely bullish back in 2019
because in 2019, i remember that bitcoin, you know, was going from the low 3 000 levels all the way up to 14 000 in a matter of, you know, it was a couple of months, it was a couple of months, but it was, you know, basically four or five weeks
of course, what happened afterwards? you know, we had the continuation, you know, you are very macro lead creating a lower high
so you did have, you know, this kind of still bearish momentum you know, the entire year of 2019 and part of 2020, of course
um, so, yeah, i do think that, yeah, basically, you are going to have some bullish momentum
the next push down on bitcoin will be an insane buying opportunity
it might go sideways for for some time, but you are going to see bitcoin pumping pretty aggressively when we have the next big, major drop
that would be the ideal scenario, uh, which will indicate a massive capitulation event
and i would, i'm going to put a very, very big swing trade, and i'm going to buy a huge, a huge amount of bitcoin, of course
is, is my celsius account safe and sound? i mean, celsius is centralized
i'm not too sure how they do distribute their what kind of rewards, you know, how sustainable it is their system on on giving rewards, they're staking and everything
also, block fires is huge, okay? you know, many partners, many big, big players behind, uh, block five
you know, you could wake up one morning and, you know, they're there
their page is going to be down, and you have your, your, your bitcoin and your crypto there
and, yeah, they, they have full control of your cryptocurrency, and you don't
so this is the thing about centralized, centralized um um accounts, wallets, platforms that do give you returns on your crypto, uh, not your keys, not your crypto
uh, public, uh, public issam says they are scared ethereum will go the ways of luna
because, of course, ethereum doesn't have the um, you know, it has a different, uh, the the unlock of ethereums are, you know, is, is inside of their protocol
of course, you can upgrade ethereum, but, yeah, like i said, you know, it does have infinite supply, but it has a mechanism where, you know, it slowly, slowly creates a um
ethereum, of course, most of the projects are built on ethereum
so i would say 70, 70 or even 80 percent of the projects are built on ethereum
you know, all of these gaming projects deep, most of d5 is built on ethereum
metaverse, you know, a decentraland, you know, sandbox, they're all built on ethereum network
so, yeah, this is not the, this ethereum is not going to be a luna, basically
let me just um, it probably is going to feel that wick, uh, i i guess you're talking about this week over here, the wick that we did create from the, uh, the 12th of may
12th of may, we did create this wick on the daily, on the weekly
you know, this is very likely going to get filled after this kind of price action
er we, i mean, this is the, we were talking about this guys, remember? do you guys remember that we did talk about this, and we absolutely crushed it
guys, if you didn't take any trades on these major levels, i mean, i i haven't been trading for the last few days
because, yeah, i'm good, you know, i'm, i'm having a good time my, you know, my trading last couple of weeks has been absolutely huge
i've been trading the range, uh, you know, all the way from late, last week of of of may and the first week of june has been absolutely huge
but if you remember, on the latest videos here, back in, uh, in, in late may, we were talking about this scenario here
we were talking about this where we were creating, you know, a very, very similar price action from december of 2021, just about six months ago
and we actually, if you if you're not an old subscriber, you know, if you're absolutely nailing this situation here, um, where we were going to retest these highs
very, very similar, you know, fractal here on on bitcoin from december of 2021
super super happy with a few trades that i did take you the last couple of weeks
and i haven't been trading for the last few days, and i don't think i'm going to trade in between today and tomorrow because, yeah, i'm basically going to enjoy the weekend
we're doing a little bit of analysis, and just is very likely going to be boring price action
but like i said, you know, this is a kind of a redistribution pattern, a redistribution event
i did actually short this because this was a swing failure pattern, of course, back in december
you can check out the videos from back there in december over the channel
i do remember this scenario also, shorting this range, looking for that consolidation, seeing that failed breakout here, this kind of batman pattern, and saying, guys, it is time to short, baby
okay? but i remember also a lot of a lot of youtubers in general, being extremely bullish at this range, you know, breaking the resistance of this, of this decent of this um of these lower highs, basically right of this trend line
and we also saw this here, okay, in, uh, yeah, what was it? the last day of of may? the 30th of may, having that breakout here from this range
i remember longing this level and, you know, being super, extremely cautious, guys, we're looking to retest this last lower high, something very similar that happened back in december
and then here i will be taking most of my profits from this long position and looking for shorting the bitcoin price after this consolidation
and, yeah, i remember a lot of people saying, you know, this is extremely bullish
we're going to see an absolutely insane, big relief rally here because of, after this big, massive drop that we've had in may, you know, we are looking to see higher levels
we were looking for that major rejection at this 32 000 level, you know, absolutely perfect couple of weeks
and, um, yeah, i'm just having a little bit of a break from the trading because, yeah, it's been really, really good couple of weeks
so anyway, let's, you know, like i said, it's very, very likely to to continue back down
this is a clear, let me just explain, this is a clear redistribution where you do have, you know, that those trap long positions, you have trap bullish people, where you think that you are going to go to much higher levels, because you're starting to break lower high trend line
all right, you do think that you're going to go to much higher levels
also, the price action was slightly different, of course, uh, just after retesting this level, a little bit more volatility
but, you know, like you can see here, this big major wick back in december, which was all the way here at the 41 300 levels, was filled
and the price action after that, consolation, was pretty pretty fast
you know, some a pretty pretty fast movement in the next coming days
you know, we could still consolidate here a little bit, uh, but i do think that we are going to retest the lows here at the 25 000 levels
i can see 70 percent, but we got 548 votes here on the poll, and most of the people are bearish
and the bitcoin sensor, scotty says, would you do a limit buy to short? uh, ethereum, thanks
uh, no, i i guess, a limit order on aetherium? no, i wouldn't
i would actually wait for a potential reaction at this major zone
i mean, i'm not sure if we are going to come, come all the way up to the 1 700, 1 680
could you put a limit order? i mean, yeah, of course you could
you know, you might have a big, massive wick coming up there to get extremely large, you know, big leverage positions
we know that the trend is to the downside, and people are entering into in short positions at these levels
and this is very, very real, you know, i, i just, i know a lot of you may be watching this as entering in shorts
and you might be well off, you know, in the next coming days, because it's likely to continue back down
but you do get these big, massive kind of wicks, okay, a massive price action to the upside to get all of those, you know, over leveraged positions
there are people trading here at 50 x, 100 x, shorting from these levels, trying to ride this down
and what happens a lot of the times that you do get those big relief rallies, you know, these big, big pumps to um, to actually get these traders out of the market, so then the trend can continue healthily to the downside
so, i mean, yeah, in in this case, a limit order, maybe at this, right, at this 1 680 1700 range, you might, it might get triggered, and then you might be looking at and the trend will continue to the downside
you know, you you get into an order here thinking that you you're gonna get a big, um, a big resistance, you know
and this is why i i, you know, if i lose money, it's a very, very small amount
i did explain this last few days, because, um, i'm patient, i'm patient, and i want to see a reaction at some levels, you know
and a lot of people like saying, you know, i remember on bitcoin the last few days, you know, you said we were going to get a, uh, um, we would say, you said that we were going to get a reaction at this level, and and we didn't, you know, once we came all the way down here, uh
this was a major, major resistance here, the three thirty thousand five hundred dollars, and we broke it
and i remember guys, we're looking for, i'm looking for shorts at this level, i'm looking for shorts
and then, of course, you know, i thought that we would, we were going to get a stop here
but, you know, i'd still, i closed 50 on my trade, and i did ride a lot of the trade also, down all the way to these levels also
but i remember some people saying, you know, i thought you said that this level was going to hold, that we were going to get a bounce
i said, yeah, i mean, it's, it's possible, because it has been a strong resistance
but if you do not get that consolidation, then you do not trade it
so this is why, you know, most of the times i don't put limit orders
i mean, like i showed you at the beginning of the live stream, guys, if you take a look at the daily chart on bitcoin, you know, we haven't solidly break out from this major range
i've been talking about this daily level, okay, for the last few days
you can have that volatility to the downside, but if, you know, if we do close this daily you know, we might have a bigger relief rally all the way here to the 29 300
you know, i think it's pretty foolish, foolish, if you do not think that this can happen
this can definitely happen, you know, in the next, you know, couple of days
also, uh, i would be much, uh, i would prefer to actually short the twenty nine thousand, uh, three hundred dollar retest of we did retest this early this morning, very, very early this morning
that was an insane trading opportunity, like i just said on the live stream
if we have a solid breakout, this is going to be major resistance
we have several, you know, on the one hourly, you also have a four hourly, big candle close here, breaking their, uh, the the support level
this was an insane trading opportunity right there, early this morning
this was at eight, uh, yeah, around about eight, uh, eight o'clock central european time this morning, retesting that 29 300 range
you know, absolutely perfect to to to take a trade, because this has broken a big, big, big level
i told you, too hot to hold that short to 24k, man, what happened? i locked into, uh, jk, i locked it into but i wish just had patience, had the patience at jerome, uh, yeah
i mean, i did see a lot of people were saying, hold the short from this range
25 of my trade got stopped out with this, with this volatility
i didn't get i did reenter a short position though, at that level
um, but yeah, i, i mean, this is the thing, i am greedy taking profits
i actually took 50 of my trade position at down here at the 30 600
then i took 50 of that 50 all the way down here at thousand four hundred dollar range
but, yeah, i mean, this is, this is the thing we day trading with small swing trading
i mean, i don't like to have a trade open for a month or six months
okay, where i do have a swing trade position for three, four, you know, maybe one week, maybe slightly more than one week, but, yeah, not several months
yeah, we have a little bit of of pumpy action here on bitcoin
uh, today's daily it looks like it, you know, we might be closing this daily candle
guys and you we could not ignore this because, you know, the daily level here is at twenty nine thousand five hundred and eighty, twenty nine thousand six hundred
if we close this at this range, um, yeah, we might have a, have a big relief rally
we might have a bigger relief rally in the next couple of days
it's, in my opinion, it's going to be another good short opportunity
i do see the price in the next, you know, coming days, couple of weeks, coming down to retest this zone
it's very likely, you know, i would be very, very surprised if i do see bitcoin at this current price action, at these current levels, have a massive reversal from this level, you know, in the next coming days, like this
if you haven't signed up for buy bit, you've got an insane bonus down below
this is my favorite day trading platform for also for trading different, you know, assets such as s p 500
there's a huge amount of assets using crypto as collateral, stable coins, or btc and ethereum, which is absolutely phenomenal
you know, just a couple of days before the competition starts, looking for bitcoin and ethereum trade most of the times
uh, you know, if we are going to share ideas on the telegram group
and those people that are not joined on the team, of course, will be, um, we are going to eliminate these people, because these are just people for the competition, all right? because we'll be sharing, uh, technical analysis and and and trading
i'm not gonna focus on ten all coins, 15 all coins, because you just need one asset, okay? and i'm going to focus on bitcoin and ethereum to absolutely crush the trades, all right? um, crush the markets, make absolutely phenomenal trades and be huge
there's, you know, people there that are going to be full on, and they are very, very good traders
i'm really going to aim in the top 10, at least if we can finish first, of course, yeah, why not? why not? guys? um, uh, [Music], short on it

make sure to smash up that like button on your way out to 300 likes
in today's episode, i will go through bitcoin and why i do believe that we can bounce in between the 50 and 61 on the three monthly chart
i've showed you this a couple of weeks ago, about us coming back down to this level, and this is exactly what's happening right now
and i do believe that we can potentially come back up to 28 965
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you a longterm target on bitcoin and shortterm target
and i remember that we were talking about this, uh, hanging man, and that the market were supposed to fail this week
and this is where we could find where the market, slowly and steady, we just might come back down a little bit more
but i can definitely see from these levels around 26, 100, 200
and as i told you, we just might, uh, have a little bit more movement to the downside before before we slowly and steady start to see that bitcoin moves to the upside again
because remember, when it comes to market structure, we need to understand that the higher time frames is the one leading the way
and we could have seen long time ago that the market was actually about to come back down to the fibonacci level
the same way i'm using the fibonacci on the lower time frames, we're using it the same, exact same way on the higher time frame
so you need to ask yourself one question, if it always works on the lower time frames the way we use fibonacci, why is it not working on the higher time frame? so if you understood on the higher time frames that we had fibonacci levels around 26, 532 and 500, around these levels, you knew the market were supposed to come back down here
and this is the most important thing, that we don't try to involve the emotions
because if it works on the lower time frames, it will also work on the higher time frames
but if we just try to focus on what's actually happening right now, i'm just going to use the same trend line that i've used all the time
and as you can see, we're created the 50 assay support and the 618 percent as not as a resistance just yet
but you can see that the market is heading back down to this level, around 26 300
and as i told you in the beginning of the video, we just might see the market pull back down a little bit more
but remember, if you've been following me for a long time, on the higher time frames, you usually see the market break through it, and then slowly instead, you see the market push back up
but when the market finds one support, the low, you'll see how slowly instead of the market will reverse back up and then create the 61, 618 percent assay support and the 50 as a resistance
we will have one leg, the last leg to the downside, and then slowly instead to see the market creating the higher lows, even if we see the market push back down a little bit more, but from one of the lows, i don't believe that the market will break it
and even if the market goes sideways, i don't think it would break that low
i can be totally wrong also, but this is definitely something that i think could happen
if we're just continuing to go down slowly, instead of to the lower time frames
you can see that we've been in a sideways market for a couple of weeks
now we're just gonna identify the the, uh, the sideways market that we tried to break during today
we actually did that, so we're just going to go down to the four hourly chart
now what we also can do is that we drag a resistance trend line
the market can definitely break inside the the sideways market again, the support around twenty eight thousand seven hundred
and that can slowly instead take us back up to the middle of the range
or we could possibly see the market pull back up to the resistance one more time
this is not obviously going to happen right now, but i just want you to see the bigger perspective of what we can expect the market do
now during these coming months, we just might see the market also pull back up to 32, 500 or 600
and when the market pulls back up to this level, what do you think people will do? people will try to buy the market as much as they can
and what happens? we know the market comes to a fibonacci level, and then you just might see the market pull back down again
maybe not all the way back down to the 618 percent, but definitely potentially back down to the support
maybe they support around 29 400, or all the way back down to 28 600
but this is why it's really important for us to understand where are we in the market
what type of market are we in? we are inside the higher time frames, fibonacci levels, where we do expect the market slowly, instead, it reversed to the upside
but we also have to have in mind that you could potentially see the market be very boring and just go sideways
and if you don't understand this, it's so easy for you to get faked out, and you're just waiting for the market to do the big move
but the market is just consolidating on the higher time frames to collect orders, to just to just do whatever it's supposed to do
and then slowly and steady, you see the market reverse either to the upside
but everybody using the technical tools, we need to follow that
and if the market change direction, we're just going to continue to follow that
and if you go to the four hour chart, what we can do is that would drag another fibonacci from 29 293 back down to the lower 28 380
so we just might see, you can, but you can already see the market is retesting the support
but if we come inside again and we only see a retest of 28 830, potentially 28 936, this could be where the market then creates the next lower high, lower high, lower high, potentially next lower high
if this is the case, target one is twenty eight thousand one hundred and fifty seven
and take profit three is twenty seven thousand two hundred and forty
so this is the move that i expect the market could potentially do, maybe tomorrow or in the beginning of next week
but if we start to see the market giving us one huge, big candlestick to the upside, and we break the 50 and 61 percent level, you come you see the market give us a retest of the support instead
that could take us back either the market comes back up and retest the trend line one more time and then see the market reverse back down
or this could be the beginning that we see the market pull back up to the resistance again
because remember, in a sideways market, the market is just bouncing in between the support and the resistance
so remember the tree that i was saying it take profit that hit just a couple of hours ago
i had my take profit at twenty eight thousand nine five hundred and ninety
this was a trade that i held for, i think it was about four days
i saw the market around on eighth of june, the market came up exactly
but i had the patient, and i was pretty, pretty sure about that the market was going down
and today, four days after, around four days after the market hit, my take profit
and don't forget, guys, that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and the good thing is, by holding your position for this long time, the very, very, very low fees is the one that we want
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
tell me, what do you think will happen? do you agree with me? do you have something else you see on the charts? because what i show you is just what i see
so please share that in the comment section down below the video
hit the notification so you know, when i am live tomorrow, i hope everyone will have a super great weekend
this is gonna be a a live stream where we're just going to go through some of the charts, um bitcoin in the theory mostly, just a couple of other ones, and then we're just going to go and backtest
how are you? just gonna wait for some people to jump into the charts
if you haven't already issued, i actually want to learn crypto trading
but if you have never, i don't know where you are in your trading journey
but if you, if you go to my we will go through the live stream today, obviously, so you will learn some things
um, this is basic of what you need to be, what you need to uh, for you to become a trader
i actually live in town in sweden, or in stockholm, and i was outside
uh, as you guys know, i, i've had this for a long, a couple of days, i think it's two days, two, three days that i've had this, um, this trade on
i see rush on my, i see all of you on my live stream, but raj actually is a very good because you can see he's in the community chat, and he's sure sometimes
you know, when you put down the work, you you see the results
but my entry is from thirty thousand five hundred and sixty eight
and my target is at twenty eight thousand six hundred and sixty no problem
and this is great, because through through bitcoin census, i mean, you can also receive a bonus on up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and just like me now, when i've had my trades, uh, being being active for a couple of days or so, it is the low fees that we really want to have
so for example, when you have, okay, i also trade at prime expt
but if you hold your position for a longer time, the fees is very high
i trade with you fifty thousand, thirty thousand, five hundred and twenty one and now in profit, two thousand
okay, so i sold the market at 30 568 to go down to the lower time frames, just to make sure
so what we saw, the market has been going sideways for such a long time now, it's completely boring
i actually didn't even consider it going into the charts or trade the chart, to be honest, because i was already in the position
uh, i did not look for any other trades, because the market, i was just waiting for the job
so when did this? so when did market? yeah, but the market always showed us
so this morning, i don't, i seriously don't remember exactly what we were talking about, but it's the t on the dog
okay, so by looking what happened today, uh, this is also great, to just see what happened, even if i didn't take the trade
so what i did now was that i took each a fibonacci from 30 320 back down to 29 682
what am i talking about? okay, but we saw the market retest this level
and eventually you just saw the shoes drop based on this fibonacci was always on, uh, take profit and getting hit at twenty nine thousand five hundred and fifty three
twenty nine thousand two hundred and thirty four and twenty eight thousand nine hundred and fifty three
and my take profit is at twenty eight thousand six hundred and sixty
and this could be where you continue to see the market drop, right? because the market needs to find a support
um, so if we so again, we already retested the 50 at 28, 29 228, but if we would start to see some more movements to the upside, we can also come back up and retest the support that we did break around twenty nine thousand four hundred and seventy
so if you go back to the one hourly, not four hourly, it looks better
so when i take this, uh, i, when i take this box, i highlight this candlestick right here with the body all, uh, only because from this candlestick you saw this huge push to the upside
so this is a demand zone where you could definitely see the market pull back up to a retest, if that is the case, or we just only now see the market drop from this level
but it is the weekend, the market is not moving so much, so don't expect a big move
that is why, uh, it's great to do the back testing session now, because the market is not so well, the market is not so, um, it's not so exciting right now
but why did we have the support trendline? well, because taking a fee from this high to this low, you saw the market retested these fibonacci
we were below this fibonacci level for so many, so for so many, uh, hours, days, or was it days? it's up for a long time at least
and we are when when we use the trend line, you can see how clear everything looks
so we saw the break of the trend line, fibonacci, from the high 1810 to the low at 1772
what happened market? and you also saw this huge week, which we know by now, the market will retest where it filled
market came back up, retested fibonacci at 1007, market went straight down
these are the um these are the setups that i've been waiting for the market to do
you cannot go into my youtube channel and see me talking about the market being bullish at all
okay, but what can happen to ethereum, drag fibonacci from 1735 back down to 1665
if we would see the market have some momentum to the upside, which is not a momentum, is only a pullback
well, we can come back up and retest the previous support that we did break at 1700
we can also come back up to 1 1708, and then see the continuation down
um, because when we broke this support right here, the next level if okay, because this can also happen
if we would see that the market is closing above 1730, and closes above it, this could be where the market needs to pull back up and retest the trend line again
and either we see the market have some movements more to the upside, or we see the break
this is not something that we need to focus on right now, because, first of all, we need to focus if we even come back up and retest the fibonacci levels that i just showed you very important
we need to look at that first before we think about what can happen above here
and if we don't see the market giving us the best, um, we just might
if we just drag the fibonacci from 1690 back down to 1665, you already saw the market retested fibonacci at 1677
i wouldn't suggest, even though i'm no financial advisor, because i only share my thoughts, but i would and focus so much, i wouldn't focus so much right now on trading, because the market is really slow
maybe because i do this 24 7, but trust me, i have a good memory
okay, we can just go through some of the charts that we went through this morning
so i wanted us, so this one, you unif i just showed you a very quick one because i had to go
but either we would break the support and see rita's from below
market then could pull back up to 7923, potentially eight points, uh two
we never came back up to this fibonacci level, obviously, because the market was just going straight down
oh, but what we could have done taking flip from 105 back down to the low at this low right here, or this low
but i'm you could choose whatever, uh, choose 19971 meant live stream, myron, we came back up, retested 101 and 1026
and we could now see the market just came back down to take profit three, one two, three, got hit during
so where could we have seen the yesterday? oh, i think we were talking about this one
speaking of memories, we could have taken the fibonacci from in nine to eight point eight, back down to this week, right here
this is what i when i say you you need, we need to play around with the fibonacci
either you could have taken it from nine to four point nine or two ninety three point market came back up
but that is why it's so good go back testing, because you can see what you can do next time
and what else? solana, does this happen today? please tell me it did
eleven, because lauren said, so you see my hair? i was outside today, i needed to go to the store, and it started to rain from nowhere
have you ever heard this song with um londrell? uh, what is it? eleven, eleven
if you, if you would like to hear a guy like especially, this is especially for women, guys
this is especially for women, if you want to to listen to and of obviously, for men too
but if you want to listen to someone that speaks to your soul like londrel, i'm gonna write his name
he's the one that i'm gonna, uh, hopefully look at when i, uh, in september in uk
mike, mike bolton, no, no, sam, this this guy is, he's top notch
we can go, we can analyze waves for, uh, mike, um, and then we go to the back testing
but love for allah, for the people in ukraine and all over the world, and for everyone that doesn't feel good, and for everyone that feels good too, but especially the ones in need
because we are very, very, very, very lucky to be where we are, sitting at the charts, learning how to, how to, um, grow money from ace, from a skill set
and there are people all over the world that doesn't have this opportunity
how did you know i'm from ukraine? because i know stuff, you know
now, what i did was that on the weekly i did highlight the support that we did break
what i mean was that we understood the the overview of what's happening
and then we're looking at the daily just to identify what happened, trying to take a fibonacci from 1550 back down to the support at 435 market
so remember now, when we're looking at when we start to see that the market pull back up to because you could see on the lower time frames how the market slowly and pretty fast, came back up to the previous support
but when we dragged the fibonacci, now we also know that we did have the support, we also saw the fibonacci which the market came back up and retested the 618 percent precisely at 1123
but when you just break everything down step by step, um, step by step, you you see exactly what the market is actually doing with clean charts, clean charts
okay, so we all, we tried to break it, rita's fibonacci levels
oh, so yesterday, eight point, eight point eleven dollars, we retested the support
um, we also have a a lower low right here at 750, which you which i could possibly see if we have a pullback
because remember that when we buy, when we sell the market, would never want to sell the market at the lower low
we need to find where the potential lower high can be, because that is the best price to sell the market from
753 or 760 can be a level where you see the market try to retest and then potentially continue down
i based on what we see right now, i think it can be a little bit choppy, or we just see the continuation of the drop, but we can definitely see a pullback down
if we break that level, you can also see the market come back down to 190
but this is what it looks like right now on on waves or the support this one
seriously, i have no clue, but it doesn't look really good right now, when it comes to it
okay, so we can go to, hello ukrainian, my god protect you all
we love ukraine's here in ghana, and so we feel the same for you guys there
who's the one, who's the one creating the worst? those are the problems
you know, i know that 999 of everyone in this whole wide world doesn't even want people to fight or war
and then people blame each other instead of looking at the people who actually does it
but with that, we go back to the back testing part, okay? and this is something well, because i i share, i share my my my knowledge with you guys when it comes to trading
and whatever i want you to do with this skill set is, first of all, to for yourself, have the life that you want, and then help other people the way i help you, but in your own way
i just want to trade, deal with millions of people without saying a word
if you don't want to help people, only help yourself, you do that
back testing us 30, because it gives me such great even if we see the market how, you know, being in a complete uptrend
um, okay, so looking at the two 12 monthly charts, it's just pretty fun to look at
so when we back test, we go jump in between, do whatever, just to make sure that we understand where we are in the charts
so what i'm gonna do is that, based on that, we are in this 12 hourly chart, now, 12 monthly chart
um, this was the opening, and this was obviously also also the opening
but you could see that during, uh this, uh, this, uh, six months, we came back down and retested this low
so it's very important for us to understand, okay, why did we just come back down to this level, and why did you then see the market pull back up? because when we when we come to a, when we come to a close and an opening, and especially on the two monthly charts, this is a very strong level
so let's see what happens when we go back down to the lower time frames
so from the candlestick that we can see right here, we do have a candlestick that, from this one, you saw this huge push
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm just gonna try to highlight it and see what we can do with it
we came back down and retested the the the the close and the opening of the 12 monthly chart
so last two weeks ago, we came back up and retested the preview support
it's very important to understand where the close is when it comes to the candlesticks
going back down, you saw the market consolidate on this between around this level, and then you saw the market broken
oh, smoking dnl, hello, how are you? how are you okay? guys, what do you want me to look at? i mean, i'm a little bit tired, i'm not gonna lie, but, [Music], what can we look at? i'm just trying to [Music], katie
ronnie, yeah, guys, if you're new to the channel, or if you just jumped into the live stream, um, today, or to, uh, right now, we're going, we're gonna go into some back testing, just to see what happened
not so many other coins in the beginning because, um, the market is very slow, and it looks kind of the same
um, but you can go back in the live stream if you want to know prices or, uh, on ethereum and bitcoin
what i've seen, if you are new to the channels, don't forget to subscribe to it so you always know when i am live
i am already in a trade on bitcoin since a couple of days ago, from 30 568 my take profit is at 28 860
we almost came back down to this level today, but pull back, and then another drop, hopefully
uh, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and sixty dollars by using the link, four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and this is how you supporting me, in bitcoin senses, by doing that
um, okay, so let's see what, uh, welcome to back testing, guys
i'm just gonna see if we got something that could be fun to backtest
okay, so fibonacci, we've been going through that 10 billion of times
i'm oh, we can back test ethereum, because we haven't i i don't think we've ever backtested ethereum
so we can just try to go back in time and see what has happened
and another important level for us to use is the week of last, uh, six monthly charts, um
and we also want to use the the body of la last six months, because if we see a pullback against these levels, the market can only do pull back to them for a retest and then continue to drop
what am i even doing? like, god, it's just like i forgot that i'm on a live stream
and when we understand why the why we retested it, if we go to the six monthly chart, it's because this was the low of the last six monthly low of the wick
can you see how perfectly the market came back, came and retested it? did we see a retest of the [Music]
they closed up the body, retested it from below, saw the huge drop back down, and we broke the uh, oh, my god, bernie, what? because i had my kitchen, i just saw, can you turn off the kitchen lights? and my kitchen light is on
so they see where people have their stop losses, and then they push the market to those areas
when they see where, usually where the people have their stop losses, they they make a fake move to take people out, and then the market continues to the right direction
but natalie, what do you think we already at the bottom with ethereum, no, i don't think so because you have such a huge, okay, i mean, we're coming back down to previous support
and from this support we saw the mu, the market have such a huge push, right? and, um, between 1685 and 1532
[Music], we want to see if we break 1540 we can come back down to
if we're looking at the three monthly chart, we take fibonacci from 107 back up to 39, 3690
this is levels where the market has, oh, i've been talking about this long time ago, long, long, long time ago, i i talked about the market pull back down to this level
so the the low we can come back down to is 1464, around that level
go down to the lower time frames, we can go back and see that this is actually a demand zone
from this candlestick, you saw this huge push, right? so from this candlestick right here that we did have on 28th of february, this is the daily chart, it was from this push we saw this huge momentum to the upside
so when we go back in time, what we can think about is that we just might see the market come back down to, potentially 1460, 1425
but we can obviously also come back down to, if we use the wick, also, at 1290
so this is a zone where you could probably see the market pull back down to
but if we see the market consolidate in between these levels and slowly start to see the market pulling back up, remember that we are right now inside the fibonacci level, the 15 60 percent
because this is where we would want to see the market, or this is where i expect the market to, first of all, consolidate, because that usually what the market does when the, when we um when we are in a higher time frame, fibonacci level
and so that is why it's very important for us to understand that, okay, between 1880 and 1460, potentially 1293, this is where you could see the market just consolidate on the higher time frames also
so if we identify, because remember guys, after a huge drop like this, before the market is reversing back up, the market is going, uh, sideways, and then you see their rally to the to the other direction
that was the exact same thing that happened here, before you saw the market broke to the downside, you saw the market consolidate a couple of um, so if the consolidation started at, uh, 28th of october 2001, and we broke the level 28th of december 2001, october, august, september
so two, three months, the market was consolidating until the market decided what direction it would go, and we broke down
and the market is usually very slow during summer because a lot of, you know, people are going on vacations, and it's not open in the same way
so we can expect, and then when everything comes back closer to christmas and winter, you can see the market rivers back up
guys, if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that right now so we can reach out to more people
not it's like, 200 days down, 200 up, right? it is? i haven't count, i haven't, um, but it could definitely
but we can go to, so let's let's say we go to do we have no, i think like euro usd is better when it comes to see
stacy, are you still here? jalen, stacy, are you still here? because remember we were talking about the uh you were using a couple of days ago
can you see what happened? can you see what happened? okay, we had, this is a, this is a fake out
this is a a stop hunt that we have right here because a lot of people sold their market
what does the market do? well, it takes stop losses, and then you see this huge bounce back down
but we did analyze this for stacy a couple of days ago, and take profit 2 got hit on the fibonacci
maybe stacy is not here anymore, but hopefully she, she took it
but okay, so one of my mentors that i've had since a long time ago, and gpp gpi, he told i saw and put up this today, that gbp gpi is is the is the real deal
so we can go into gjnc, is it stacy? was it stacy, i think that's her name correctly
okay, so we could see the market, uh, on the sixth monthly chart on gb and gbp gpi um, from this demand zone, from this support we from this candlestick we had on the second of january 2012
now, i'm looking at the six monthly chart, so this is a very, we usually don't go to the six monthly chart, but it's always good to look at the higher time frames just to see the perspective
what we also can do? uh, because we saw the market push back up from one, 119 point, six hundred and
you saw the market had the push, came back down, but we closed above the previous low
we also created a retest of this previous support that we did have around, uh, 2nd of january 1995
[Music], do we have anyone that's born 1995 here on the live stream? yes
let me ask you what, what year are you born? guys? what is your date of year? birth year? 1992, baby
i'm so happy that we have people that want to look at this live stream
that is, i'm not going to say old, because you're not, but you know what i mean
but, i mean, you're pretty quick of writing for being born 1953
um, so what what we also could can see right now on gj uh, is that we understand that we are in a option right now, or it can be a beginning of the option
but we also need to make sure that when we come back up to this high at one, 186 point, 618 and 192 points and 944, this is a level, you this is a supply zone where, you where, if we reach this level, you could definitely see the market have some pullback to the downside
even if the market is going to be an uptrend um, the market will reverse from this zone
how does that feel? okay, so another thing, another thing that we also could have seen from this trend line is that we also came back down and retested it so perfectly
so what i've been doing when i back test, so this is one thing that when i back when i back test, i i dive deeply into what happens when the market reverses
so what i usually do is that i just highlight the the area where i want to see the market um, what i want to focus on
and we saw the market break this level, right? and we can, we can try to make it a little bit more beautiful
when we're looking at the break of when we're looking at the break, uh
one thing that we see is that you see the market give us on the two weekly so we have a lot of weeks when the market tried to break inside of the support of the resistance trend, trendline again
so i want to see how the wicks looks on the lower time frames
so you you saw how the market always tried to break inside, but then, um, but, i mean, i wouldn't use that trend line, to be honest
would have thought that when we closed inside, i would be like, yeah, the market is going down again, because this is such a huge trend line that we're breaking
but one thing that we never did was that we never broke this support
so this is, and we take the fibonacci from that support one, from 104 49623 to 155683
not only is is it such thing as invert inverted breakouts? um, i mean yes
because we saw the market try to break inside the trend line again, but then the market closed above, and you saw the retest
i'm not sure if it's called inverted breakout rate, but or did you say breakup, fake out breakouts? i'm not sure
but slowly we, we as this is the thing, we never broke the support that had, from this support, or from this low
you saw just one second, guys, um, from this law that we did have on the 19th of april 2001, we this was, you saw the break from this low
we came back down, but we never broke the low that tried to, that had the push, right? you slowly, instead, it saw, we, we all always held it
gj, i mean, we can definitely have a push back up to if this is not the case, though
um, even if we saw the breakup the trend line, the last lower high on the higher time frames is technically 185500 400
by dragging fibonacci from that high back down to the low at 128 points, 694, we are right now inside a fibonacci level where the lower high kin could be created
so looking at the the daily now, um, we try to break this high at 16560, if we come back up and retest
but on the daily this is clearly a break a fake out from the, the, uh, fibonacci level that we can see where we expect the market to reverse back down from
and if that's the case, do you think we can come back down? no, i don't think this will happen
but i wouldn't be surprised though, if we would see a retest against, potentially um, 165 points, 690 and 16577
take profit to points 1648, and take profit two and three, sorry, it will be 164525
so if we break below, if we break below and close, uh, of course, things will happen if we come back up and retest these fibonacci levels
uh, it is 57 pips to take, probably 195 pips to take profit to, and 125 pips to um, take profit three
anything in particular about the stream? what do you mean? i'm so happy
but if we close below 165106, teen, this could also be where you see the market retest
because the overall, as i told you, looking at the higher time frames perspective, we are, we are inside, we are in a downtrend, and we're coming back up and retest that a lower, high, uh, level, based on the, maybe what's on the it was the higher time frames
but we can definitely see, uh, we can definitely see the market pull back down a little bit more
i don't usually trade gj, so i'm not so good when it comes to the market movements on this pair
but we could have taken the fibonacci from this low, even this is dxy now
so, i mean, we don't trade it, but just to make sure, when we look at the correlation against the other peers, yeah
and while we were, while we've been back testing, or looking at the charts, we are coming back up on bitcoin now to retest to 29, 230
and 29 and 300 could also be a level if we see bigger momentum
looking at this candlestick that we do have here on the 50 minutes chart, we will, def i do believe that we will fill it
so we can also see a retest against 29 hundred also, or precisely, twenty nine thousand four hundred and eighty
this could be where you see the market potentially retest, and then potentially see the market continue back down, because that's what i believe will happen
first of all, remember, we did break a previous support around 100, 1742, around that level
we're just gonna, we can also, okay, looking at this previous low that we did have back in may this year
i took, i dragged the fibonacci from that level back down to 1666
this means that we can have a pullback on ethereum to 1700, potentially 1710, if we have a bigger momentum
we can also have a retest against 1719 or 20, and then see the continuation of the drop
maybe the numbers is a little bit different, depending on exactly where i put my fibonacci, but remember, it's around these levels then, uh, okay
take profit one, take profit two, is one thousand six hundred and ten
but if we come back down, uh, or i still believe that we can pull back down to one thousand four hundred and sixty five two, because that is the three monthly fibonacci, uh, 61
i mean, we, we do have such a huge candlestick on the threemonth chart, it's crazy
so it's going to be super exciting to see what, or how the market, uh, how the clothes will be, and how the next three month day candle will be also
you just might see one huge candlestick taking everything else out
guys, if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that, because i have daily updates about cryptocurrencies, and i have such great videos where you can go back down and just practice for yourself, the training for beginners, you can also see the mark

he will open your brain and make you see things from another perspective
my name is josh, and right now the price of bitcoin is on the edge of potentially reentering into this massive accumulation range, especially while the bitcoin price is struggling around some of these levels of support
but we do have a decent buy wall coming into play in the bitcoin order books, and i'll be talking more about that later in the video
and as i mentioned in the intro of this video, the price of bitcoin is right on the edge of potentially reentering into this massive accumulation range, because this green line, which is the 1000 day simple moving average, is coming in at around 28 and a half thousand
and at the time of recording this video, the price of bitcoin at the moment is sitting really close to that moving average
and we're still yet to see a weekly kennel close below 28 and a half thousands
but if we do end up seeing a weekly candle close below 28 and a half thousand, then, technically speaking, according to bitcoin's previous price history, that would significantly increase the chance of the bitcoin price dropping down towards the 200 week moving average, where, historically speaking, we've usually seen massive bitcoin bottoms around that moving average, which is currently sitting in between 22 000 and 23 000
but once again, historically speaking, when you're looking at many years worth of bitcoin's history, basically every time where the price of bitcoin drops below that 1 000 day moving average, and especially if we get closer towards the 200 week moving average, they are some of the best bitcoin buying opportunities
that's just telling you what has happened time and time again and what is most likely to occur next
and just before we get into the shortterm bitcoin price action, another signal here on the weekly time frame that usually occurs around bitcoin bottoms is when we see a massive spike in volume, like what we saw at the end of the 2014 bear markets
obviously, for pretty much the entire year of 2014, we saw a massive bear market for the price of bitcoin, where we saw the price of bitcoin reenter into this price range in between the 1 000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average
but right at the end of that bear market, just before we saw a lot of sideways consolidation, at that final candle there that basically put an end to the 2014 bear market, we saw a massive spike in volume
now keep in mind, even when the 2014 bear market bottoms out, we still had a lot of sideways price action ahead of us
because remember this right here is on the weekly bitcoin chart
so it's not like the bear market entered and then we immediately went to the moon
things obviously take some time, but overall, having this massive spike in volume on a red candle after we had already seen a lot of bearish price action
and while the bitcoin price is trading around these moving averages back at the end of 2014, entering into early 2015, this combination of indicators revealed a great opportunity to dole across average into bitcoin at that stage in the markets
and if you're looking at the weekly bitcoin volume in the present day, obviously, for the subscribers out there, you would probably already know this, but we did already see a massive spike in volume in that capitulation that happened around a month ago, when, of course, we had one of the biggest meltdowns in crypto history, which was the lunar meltdown, resulting in terraform labs selling 80 000 bitcoin on top of all of the other paddocks sold bitcoin during that time period
and once again, historically speaking, this usually means bitcoin has either hit its bottom, or it's very close to a bottom, like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market, and also like what we saw in the middle of last year
the massive spike in volume came at the end of the capitulation, but we still had one more lower low that formed in both of these scenarios, talking about the end of 2018 as the middle of last year
and so all of this here on the weekly bitcoin chart, is lining up pretty well when you're looking at the volume spikes and these important moving averages, and also the weekly bitcoin rsi, which is very close to oversold territories, but it's not there just yet
so yes, technically speaking, there is some more room to the downside
but keep in mind that this room to the downside, according to history, is somewhat limited when you're going off some of bitcoin's most significant bitcoin at bottoms
and just giving you a quick update here on the daily bitcoin charts, looking at this fractal, which is basically the price action we saw in the middle of last year, overlaid on top of the current bitcoin price action
and obviously we've already seen a bit of an outlier here where the price of bitcoin basically deviated from this fractal for a shorter amount of time
but right now we're basically back on track, because we've seen that shortterm pullback as expected at what this fractal was suggesting
and once again, this too falls in line pretty well with what i was saying on the weekly bitcoin chart about the price of bitcoin
it's still having a little bit more room to the downside, technically speaking, but for the most part, i'm expecting a lot of sideways consolidation with some volatility in between, potentially over the next few weeks or so, before we might perform a bit more of a relief rally, maybe in a month from now, after more things get priced in
and what i mean by more things getting priced in is basically people pricing in the fed raising interest rates higher than what was previously expected, because inflation came in much hotter than what was expected yesterday according to previous predictions
but if you're new to the channel and you want more information about all of that, check out my last video here on the channel
but now getting into the short term bitcoin price action here on the four hour time frame
and at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is really struggling to maintain above 28 and a half thousand, which is our level of support that is important here
and technically speaking, as of recording this video, we have seen one for our candle close below 28 and a half thousand
but when you're talking about a line of support this important, really we need to see at least a daily kindle close at below 28 and a half thousand in order to potentially confirm a further break to the downside
and on top of that, if that does end up playing out, ideally, if we could also see some sort of retest actually confirming 28 and a half thousands as new resistance, that would simply be more confirmation of a further break to the downside
but right now, at the time of recording this video, we haven't seen that
but we did actually see that for this previous level of support, which was coming in at around 29 and a half thousands
obviously, over the past one day or so, we saw a break to the downside below 29 and a half thousand, and then we saw a decent retest of that level, confirming it as new resistance with a rejection from that level
and so that is the type of price action that i'll be looking out for, but instead of 29 and a half thousands, looking at this 28 and a half thousand level now
but something else to keep in mind is the bitcoin order books across all of these exchanges
and right now we actually have a decent amount of buy orders coming in at pretty much exactly 28 000 per bitcoin
and so that buy war at 28k, once again, could act as some shortterm support for bitcoin as well, even if we do break below 28 and a half thousand
and in case you missed my last video, i formed a team in the world series of trading, the biggest trading competition that happens only once per year
and this year there's a total price pool of up to eight million usdt
and so if you want to potentially earn yourself a share in eight million dollars, all you have to do is literally just join my team
and the more members we have in this team, the more likely we'll place well in the competition, which means potential prize money for our members
and it costs absolutely nothing to sign up and join this team
but there is criteria for the competition, where you can find out more on this page right here
and i'll include a link to this page in the description down below
in fact, it'll be the first link in the description and the first link in the pin to comment if you want to check this out
and make sure to watch one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to maximize your profits in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so in today's episode, i'm going to be updating the series that i run on my channel called bitcoin bull run, priced against oak cranes
now, this is a series that i have not updated in approximately three weeks
you can see i've done two videos on this so far, and people seem to enjoy it
so first of all, you might be wondering if this is your first time on my channel
you know, what is this guy smoking? how on earth are we even remotely in anything resembling a ball run? because if you do look at the bitcoin
if you look at the bitcoin usd pair, you'll notice that we're very clearly in a bear market
let's see how our videos from three and four weeks have panned out
because i was telling you, i've been telling you for over a month now, all cranes are going to get slaughtered against bitcoin
so when we do this series, what we do is we look at how old crane pairs are performing against bitcoin
we're just going to be taking a quick look, spending 10, 20 seconds commenting on a few things in every chart
as i've been saying, the bitcoin dominance is on a massive, massive rampage
so it does not matter whether the price of bitcoin goes up or whether the price of bitcoin goes down
if the bitcoin dominance is heading up, bitcoin is going to massively outperform all of these cryptos
that being said, as well, just a tiny tidbit, the dollar is on a massive, massive rampage and the stock market is heading massively down
but those two things together is not bullish for the crypto market
so in my opinion, we should expect lower price dogs for bitcoin
we should expect oak crane bitcoin pairs to capitulate much, much lower
and another way of looking at this, because unfortunately, there aren't pairs where you can get btc kda, or, you know, btc
uh, well, you might be able to get btc, but you wouldn't be able to get btc dodge and all of these different things
so we're looking at how old cranes are performing against bitcoin
if we invert the chart, uh, for example, if we do something like this, we'd be seeing this is how bitcoin is performing against the old queens
but nonetheless, we'll switch it back over look at how the elk cranes are performing against bitcoin
so kadena, kadena is a pure example of a cryptocurrency that had a massive, massive runup against bitcoin in the bull run
and as you can see, it looks like we're probably coming down another 50, down to the lows, uh, the lows on the daily time frame
if we come over here, you can see we've got a bunch of candle body closers, or, you know, we've got a few candle buddy closes back down here
and if we extrapolate it a bit further, you can actually see we could have actually plonked this trendline round here and encompassed these points as well
so that being said, it does look like bitcoin is going to massively outperform kda in the next coming months or so, especially when you look at the bitcoin dominance
if this is just going to keep on heading up, all cranes are going to get slaughtered
because, like i said, we're not here to do a bunch of ta on every single chart
we're simply here to get a better perspective of everything that's going on in the markets
within the past week, we have capitulated below the last line in the sand, the 786 fibonacci
in fact, in my last engine video, i was predicting a 53 drop against bitcoin, and we're down about 18
i would also like to, you know, mention that when we look at these, i was making these predictions, telling you that bitcoin is going to have a bull run press in all cranes a month ago
so out of curiosity, how well has this video aged in the past month? kadena is down 45, approximately against bitcoin
engine is down, uh, this this was one, two, three, four, five
we're gonna check out, uh, in four week increments, how everything is performing and how well, uh, my prediction has aged on all of these alt cranes
once again, with engine, looks like we're going back down to much, much lower price targets
this trend line is what i've got my eyes on, which, from where we are now, another 43 drop ape crane
in the past four weeks, this one looks like it has aged very well
so when you look at these price targets, if it says 437, i'm just going to say 44
but nonetheless, this is massively capitulating on the btc pair
this hasn't been out for too long, so we can probably look at this on the weekly time frame
but we have capitulated right down to your last line in the sand
if eight crane bcc keeps on heading down, we're going to get absolutely wrecked
the last eight crane video i made, because bear in mind, i do cover a lot of these upgrades separate to this series
so if you notice, if you're new to my channel, you know, and you notice me covering, you know, ape, or engine or kda, or any of these cryptos, and you, you know, you like this, ta, check out my channel, because i do cover all of these
i predicted a 165 percent drop on ape btc, and we are coming down to that level right now
so this encompasses both fibonacci, 786, from the candle body close and to the wick
and we're literally wicking below both of these on the daily weekly
we could be setting that up very, very soon, which could be very, very shaky
it looks like doge is probably about to drop another 60 against bitcoin, which makes sense
if we see bitcoin come all the way down to 23 000, which is the 200 week moving average, which is where i think we're going down to, then you're gonna see a lot of these old cranes absolutely get wrecked against bitcoin
cryptocom the past four weeks, one, two, three, four, nothing, crazy
this is very much explainable, uh, by the fact that this was when most of the sellers came in
and since then we've been down, you know, massive, massive increments
cryptocom breaking, breaking down to the 786, breaking down to the last line in the sand
if you've been holding jasmine for, you know, i fat finger this a tiny bit
i don't want to overshoot this and then, you know, be accused of cherry picking
if you were holding, uh, jasmine on the 22nd of november, you are down almost 95 against bitcoin
tron is a crypto that had a move up in the past couple of weeks, in the past couple of months, uh, which is nice
but what you'll notice is this high on the weekly time frame is just a tiny, tiny bit lower than this high
and what do you notice about this high? it is a large amount lower than this high
what do you notice about this high? a large amount lower than this high
what do you notice about this high, lower than this high? you get the gist of what i'm rolling on here
tron has been in a bear market against bitcoin since january 2018
but tell me, what is this chart? we have literally been going down from where we are right now
we are down 86 over a period of 1624 days, approximately approximately
i've drawn it to the approximate range, so it can give it, give it a week or so off
so this all coin really has not been performing well against bitcoin whatsoever
coming over into near near looks like we've hit our price target from the last video
this is your last line in the sand before we do or if if we do break below here, the next level down is about another 63 drop against bitcoin
you know, like i said, we're literally just here to look at these charts, uh, for a very, very brief period in time
i'm not here to hop over to the daily time frame, you know, draw micro fibs and give you smaller price targets
for the meantime, i'm really just here to show you the macro market structure of all these all cranes
i'm going to start speeding through some of these that i don't cover too often
if you've been holding this since november of 2021, i'm noticing a pattern here
a lot of these topped out in november of 2021, and since then, it is down 75 against bitcoin
and i'm sure once this breaks out at some point it's going to be a good trade
but until that happens, and while the bitcoin dominance is continuing to head up, it's not the time for oak queens
i'm sure you're getting the gist of this by looking at these all cranes, especially if you're new to my channel
um, i do like to look at things in different ways than other crypto youtubers might do
i know, uh, well, to be honest, i don't watch other crypto youtubers
i probably could recommend you maybe one or two good youtubers asides from me
if you do want that, then let me know in the comments down below
to prefer to kind of look at the charts in my own way and not be influenced by other people
because looking at this myself, you know, i, i don't want to seem like a dick, like i'm bragging or anything, but i'm not
these ta videos that i've been making, they have been aging beautifully
and, you know, these all cranes are getting wrecked against bitcoin, just like we've been predicting
i've been forgetting that we're, you know, measuring some of these
but as you can see, general from all of these are down since the last uh video that we made on this grt
in fact, it's capitulating down to its december 2020 mint price when this was listed over on finance
if we come over to seoul, btc, this was one of the really, really disappointing ones
because i myself am a big fan of solana, and at one point in time, this was massively, massively outperforming bitcoin
i mean, this went from, uh, it was, i can't remember exactly how much it was
but at least on the btc chart, from this bull run, it outperformed by 500
since then, it has wiped out almost all of its gains, in fact, from when it bottomed in this miniature bear, where it had a triple bottom down here, and then had a massive run up, we're now only up 78
and i do imagine that we are about to wipe out all of those games as well
you know, i, i, i always say this, i was here in the 2018 bear, and none of these all kinds are going to hold their 786
for example, ethereum, in my opinion at least, ethereum, is not going to continue to hold this
i mean, k c has been doing poorly since may of 2018, since this got listed on bitfinex, you know, had a big spike up in april 2020, but since then, massive underperformer against bitcoin
and it has just broken down from a massive bear flag ethereum, this is one of the ones that was holding up quite nicely up until recently, and then we had a massive head and shoulders passing
we broke below it, and now, in my opinion, we're heading down to much, much lower price target
618 is all the way down here from where we are at this moment in time
and then from down there, about another 42 drop down to the trend line
so technically, out of all the cryptos that i've covered in a four week period, um, or, you know, out of the cryptos that i've covered back here four weeks ago, saying they were going to go down, ada's up, actually, up 25
and sometimes it has these runs up, like ada has been a good performer in this market structure
you can see here, we bounce for one, two, three, four, five weeks before heading down
here we bounce for one, two, three weeks, and we actually bounce on the fourth week before heading down
and at this moment in time, we've been bouncing for two weeks
so we could come up to the ema ribbons before having that next leg to the downside
but nonetheless, aydah is very, very bearish, uh, at least in this market structure against bitcoin
i don't always think that it's going to be bearish against bitcoin
nonetheless, we haven't been outperforming bitcoin since 2018
so while we did make a new alltime high, uh, we actually haven't been out performing bitcoin
you if you invested in ada in january 2018, you would just be better off buying bitcoin instead, because you would be out performing this is what the ada btc chart says
if we look at litecoin, litecoin's been in the bear market against bitcoin basically its entire existence
if you've been holding this since 2013, uh, once again, you would have just been better off holding bitcoin
and i believe we're coming towards the end of this video link
sure, could have a bounce, but macro structure super, super bearish
btc, this is, you know, one of the um this crypto has been around for a while
it picked up a lot of hype in the past, uh, couple of months or so
but as you can see, since 2016, it's been in a bear market against bitcoin, which, as the title of this video suggests, is in a bull run, if you flip that scale
so bitcoins in a bull run against waves, and waves is in a bear run against bitcoin
now, once again, like i said, bnb and eth were actually holding up quite well, but bnb is now falling out of this asymmetrical triangle pattern, or rising triangle, ascending triangle, whatever you kind of want to call this market structure
it looks like we're heading all the way down to the 618, which is about a 43 drop, i think
bnb, because this has been holding up so well, and because it's only just starting this downtrend, i think it's going to get hit very, very hard
we're going to be wrapping up the video in the next couple of minutes
this has actually been performing relatively well against bitcoin
but as you can see, these coins that perform well against bitcoin are very far and few and i don't think this is going to be holding up for too much longer
all of these, all cranes are going to massively drop below the 786, in my opinion
helium, since it had its ball run in 2020, it came down to the 786, came up to the 618, confirmed it as resistance, and it has started to head down
bounce on the 786, bounce up to the 618, rejection and now we're probably moving down to invalidate the floor
you know, you came up to some of these higher fibs, got rejected from the 05, got rejected from the 618, broke down, bounced up on this week, got rejected from the 786
quant has also capitulated below the 786, probably heading down
you know, the last time i covered this, 25 as of now, about 18 percent
if we look at gmt, wow, this has got hit really hard in the past four weeks since i made my last video on this, 45 down on the bitcoin pair, and it's capitulated below the 786, and i think it's going a lot lower
this one has not been acting bullish since it got listed over on binance has been in a massive, massive downtrend
xrp against bitcoin, this is actually one of the top performers against bitcoin
you know, we've been in a bear run against against bitcoin since 2017
a bunch of the xrp bulls were saying, you know, xrp 10 100 dollars, and xop didn't even return to the alltime highs
and, you know, i don't want to go off on tangent and talk about xrp, but this chart is, not only got terrible fundamentals, not only got terrible technicals, but it's not been in a ball run since against bitcoin, since may 2017
gala, btc, which is where we are pretty much gonna be wrapping up this video before a couple of final thoughts, has also capitulated below the 786
if we take a price target, as this is the last one that we'll be doing, down 32 percent since my last set of, uh, bitcoin boron priced in alts
i hope you found some value in this, especially if you are an old crane investor
because you don't, you know, you don't need to keep up with all these charts like i do
if the bitcoin dominance is heading up, the odds are about 99 likely that your old crane is probably getting wrecked against bitcoin
i really do recommend, if you are investing in old cranes, for the love of god, look at how your old crane is performing against bitcoin
and you might also, you know, not be able to, uh, to chart your old crane against bitcoin
so, for example, there are a couple of cryptos i think fitfire might be one of them? yeah, for example, you can't chart fitfire against bitcoin
if we type in coin market cap, what you can do is you can type in fitfire
untick the usd box, tick the bcc box, or if you want a side by side, keep them both activated, and you can see how is your altcoin performing against bitcoin
i do heavily recommend, if you're invested in alts, if you're still holding on to alts, if you're buying the dip, which i do not recommend, uh, that you should be looking at these
now, this does not mean you shouldn't buy the dip on anything
but while the bitcoin dominance is going up, buying the dip is just absolutely stupid
because if the bitcoin dominance keeps on heading up like this, if it just keeps on going week after week after week after week, up to 60 and then you start to see a massive drop, that is the time to take advantage of cheap old coin prices
if the bitcoin dollars just keeps on heading up, and you're buying the dip on alt coins all the way up, you're soon gonna find that you don't have much more money to buy the dip, unless you've got, uh, like a nine to five job
and then even more so, if you've got a nine to five job and this is your source of income, you don't want to be going to work working these eight hour shifts
so you can buy alt coins, which are going to drop 90 against bitcoin
so i say this in the most friendly way possible, but if you're buying old cranes right now, you are probably gonna get slaughtered in the next couple of months
if bitcoin closes below 28 500, if it keeps on capitulating and the bitcoin dominance keeps on heading up, all of these old cranes are going to become a lot lot cheaper against bitcoin
i have made a video on how to spot the old crane bottom, if you are curious on when i personally plan on buying all cranes, when i personally plan on accumulating all coins, because there's going to be a difference between the two on here
i think there's going to be a time to buy alt queens for a swing trade, which i know a bunch of you dirty degenerates are going to love
then go check out this video, uh, titled this chart we'll call the oak crane market bottom
that will tell you everything you need to know about when to buy alt cranes
we've been in this pattern for a very, very long period of time, and now the bitcoin dominance is breaking up to the upside of this
you should probably expect the old queens are going to get absolutely slaughtered against bitcoin
and if you think the ult cranes have been performing bad while the bitcoin dominance has moved up a modest 16 then bear in mind, you know, at least in my prediction, in my humble opinion, we are coming up to the 60 mark on the dominance
this means we've probably got about another 25 percent to go up
at least, if we do continue with this move, and bitcoin moves up another 25 like we were predicting from all the way down here, then expect bitcoin to absolutely slaughter these old coins
if we look at our momentum indicator, the squeeze bomb weekly, is heading up like there's no tomorrow
we finally took out the price tag of this, so this is absolutely great
and you can see, you know, whether you want to consider this a break up into a bull flag, bull flag, or whether you want to call this break up into a rising reg rising wedge, it doesn't really matter
the fact of the matter is, you know, if we take this macro bull flag target, the bitcoin dominance really shouldn't slow down until we come up to 49 percent
bitcoin dominance is up one percent, and, you know, bitcoins down 15 percent
what are the old cranes doing? the old cranes are getting absolutely slaughtered
now, i just wanted to make this as a quick update, i'm going to make a indepth update
i do this series occasionally on my channel, where i, i believe i've made one or two videos on it, and i'm gonna make it, uh, more of a often kind of series type deal over on my channel, where we cover it maybe every couple of weeks
like i said, if you're a seasoned veteran to my channel, you probably may have watched that video before, where we talk about the bitcoin dominance heading up, where it's likely to head up to next, what to expect
but more specifically, we go through the bitcoin charts, uh, or more specifically, we check out the oak crane btc chart
so in today's video, later on, i'm going to upload this as one of my last videos
but we're going to be going through all the old cranes that i cover very, very quick ta
we're going to be looking at how these old cranes, you know, kda, doge cryptocom, jasminetron near we're going to talk about how all of these old cranes are holding up against bitcoin
because, in my opinion, bitcoin is in a bull run, priced in ult cranes
the only other thing i want to highlight is, the last time we saw, you know, a massive, massive macro w break, a massive, massive pattern break over on the bitcoin dominance was when we were back here in july of 2018
now, the bitcoin bear market law was actually here in december of 2018, and the bitcoin dominance continued to go up for two more massive legs to the upside before we found any sort of top on the dominance
i don't actually think that we're going to be going that high
you can argue diminished returns, and as such, we shouldn't head up to the alltime high
but if you were going to argue diminished returns, because obviously there's more alt cranes in the altcoin market, so it'd be harder for bitcoin to head up to the same area of dominance as it previously did
but with that being said, if that theory was to hold, then you would have expected the bitcoin dominance to head down to new lows
but however, this is where the bitcoin dominance was in january of 2018
where did we bottom this market cycle? 39 so even though there's like a thousand times more all coins as there was back in 2018, maybe i'm exaggerating by saying a thousand
there's a lot more money in the markets, especially in these old cranes, low market cap, mid caps, blue chips, all of that good stuff
but even so, the bitcoin dominance didn't go down this this is showing that, even though there's no alt cranes coming into the market, bitcoin is king, and it is holding up cycle over cycle over cycle, a lot better than these old coins are
the last time we broke out of a massive, massive pattern, we had about a 50 swing to the upside
so i really want to emphasize, i see people on the twit on my twitter
i see people messaging me on, you know, twitter and discord and instagram, saying, is now the time to buy all coins
and i was here in 2018 when everyone's saying all cranes are cheap because they're down 90
they go down another 50, at least bear in mind, you know, if you think all cranes are cheap right now, this is what we've been doing in the past month
you know, we've gone up like 15 also, or from here, uh, 23 rather
but we still have more than double that to go to the upside before we top out, in my opinion
can you imagine if we went all the way back up to 736 percent? all cranes would get absolutely wiped out against bitcoin
a lot of people are going to be thinking the bottom is in for alt cranes
but the bitcrane dominance has only just started to break out of this macro move
today, it is breaking out of this massive, massive macro move the bitcoin, uh, or the rather the squeeze one, which is our momentum indicator, starting to turn up
with all that being said, i do think it is bitcoin maxi season, if you do not have your bitcoin maxi hat on already
if you're kind of wondering, you know, what is my opinion? when? when am i going to be buying old cranes? because specifically, i made a video about when i plan on buying old cranes for a one to two month swing trade, and when i plan to buy alt cranes to accumulate
if you head over to my channel, click on videos, scroll down, you should find this video
and if you go back to that video, you will see how how well it has aged
the bitcoin dominance has done nothing but going, but went up on a rampage
but nonetheless, the bitcoin dominance is still massively heading up, uh, since that video
i am going to make a video later, uh, where i do talk about the bitcoin bull run priced in oak cranes
if you do want to watch that video, make sure to turn the notifications on
in this video, i'm going to be talking about two charts that we've got in the macro time frame for bitcoin
because in both of these charts, we started to capitulate below the last lines in the sand that we have before we could witness a move down to 23 000
also, if you're a seasoned veteran to my channel, then you'll know that i don't use the term emergency lightly
in fact, if you go through my entire channel, you'll see that i do not use the word emergency in any of my videos because there has not been the time to use the word emergency
but at this moment in time, we're sitting at a very, very crucial level
support and resistance gets weaker and weaker the more times you come down to it
you've come down to this once, twice, three times, four times
so this is getting weaker and weaker and weaker every time we go down to it
i'm to be talking about this bitcoin uh chart as well, because we've already started to capitulate below as well
first of all, if you are new to the channel as well, warm welcomes
if we look at the four hourly time frame, we are really, really dumping into this last line in the sand
now, i could probably find just one more level down from where we are here, and i will do that in just one second, but i want to talk about the fact that we've broken down
we've broken down from the bear flag, and we've come down to this last line in the sand
while we've come down to this last line in the sand, we have our momentum indicator, which is the squeeze bomb, ticking back over into the light red, indicative that bears are really getting ready to plummet us to the downside
while this is happening, we're seeing a massive increase in the volume traded to the downside for example, the last four hourly candle, we saw 534 bitcoins sold
over on this four hourly canada, we're seeing 341 bitcoin being sold
and i want to head over to some of the leverage exchanges, like buy bit and finance, because i imagine there's probably a lot more volume going over on these charts
i really only use these charts to look at the volume, by the way, if you're wondering why they're so plain
over on finance, sixteen point thousand bitcoins sold in the past four hour
in this four hourly candle, which is only two hours and twenty three minutes in, as the time of recording this, seven point eight thousand bitcoins sold
if we head over to uh to buy a bit, 31 000 bitcoin sold in the past four hour
so a lot of bitcoin is being sold as we are coming down to these levels
in fact, you want to if you're breaking down to these levels, you want to see bullish volume coming back in, like we saw, oops, like we saw here, like we saw, oh, like we saw here and here while we were coming back up, and almost like we saw here
but as you can see, when you do get this big sea of red coming in, you're very, very likely to take out the bottom
now, in the last video, i did already talk about the fact that we did break down from this massive, massive triangle pass and you can see this big purple, uh, ascending triangle has broken down
we said, at least in the short term, we're coming down to 28 600, we and we'd need to reevaluate what the market is doing as we're coming down to this level
we are breaking down very, very heavily with a lot of volume coming in
i really, well, actually, i say i really want to see bitcoin hold, uh, 28 600, but i actually really want to see it go all the way down to 23, 20 000
why i'm a longterm hodler of bitcoin? i i really don't sell bitcoin
if you watch my videos, you'll know that i've been saying i have buy orders set at 25, 24, all the way down in increments of 1 000 to 19 000
and bear in mind, i do not think we're going all the way down to 19
i my price target is 23 000, but i am willing to put lower buy orders in case that happens
so bear in mind, a lot of people were kind of worried, and they don't want to see bitcoin break down
i've been buying bitcoin for years and years and years, and i love these cheap prices because it reminds me of when i was buying bitcoin back here in january of 2020 or december of 2020
these are great prices to buy, in my opinion, for the long term
uh, are they good prices to buy at for the next week, for the next month? i do not think so
but if you're like me and you plan on buying bitcoin, slapping it in a ledger wallet and then not even checking it, like i, i don't even know how much gbp value is associated with my ledger wallet because i don't check, and i really don't care
with that being said, this is really your last line in the sand
now, if we come over to the daily time frame, you can see we have had candle body closers down here before, and we have had a wick down to 28 580
let me make sure that is the approximate value, thousand five hundred and seventy
so in my opinion, if we do start moving below twenty, eight thousand five hundred and seventy by the end of the day, if we start putting in daily candle body closes below it, we might be coming down to 23 000
now, this but we do have the next fomc meeting in it's on the 15th, so we've got about another four days until the next fomc meeting, uh, in
and according to, according to the chicago mercantile exchange group, the cme if we come over to the probabilities, uh, they are, uh, they are predicting a 100 likelihood of a increase rate hike
now, why is this important? if you haven't watched my channel before, maybe you haven't heard of the interest rate hikes
this is the date i know this is the date, because i'm looking at the price
uh, i did say that right, right? so the fourth of may was the fomc meeting
the fifth of may, uh, obviously, we had the interest rate hike, 50 basis points on the fourth of may
and if we do have another massive interest rate hike, uh, in the next four days, i do believe bitcoin is going to be carried all the way down to 30 or 23 000
why do i think we're heading down to 23 000? if we come over to this macro chart, this was your last line in the sand at 29 000
the next level to keep your eyes on is the 200 week moving average
by time we come down to this, this can be anywhere between the ranges of twenty two thousand four hundred to twenty three thousand
i think it's going to be closer to 23 by the time we get to it
and just quickly, why do i think we're coming down to the 200 week moving average? well, let's take it back a step
where did we bottom? in 2015? if we extrapolate this trendline back a bit, you can see candle body closed, bottom, counter body closed
yes, we did have wicks below that's why i'm specifying candle body clothes
what happened in the 2020 pandemic scare, march 2020? came down, candle body closed, bottom, candle body clothes
on the 200 week is normally always where we bottom in every market cycle so far
now, i also would like to wrap up this video stating that if we do come over to bitcoin divided by the m2 money supply
so once again, if you're new to my channel, you might not uh understand this concept, or you might not have heard of this before
the m2 money supply, it is basically a measure of how much money there is in the economy
dollar has been massively printing for the past couple of years
now, money print to go brewer, for the past couple of years, really past few years
and because of that, uh, that money that printed money, that artificially low interest rate money, all the, you know, stimi's, all of that good stuff that found its way into the crypto market
and because of that, bitcoin was able to rally to these crazy, crazy prices, like you can see at this moment in time
from the previous alltime high in 2019, bitcoin is up 43 percent
if we go over to the m2 money supply, so this is when we divide btc usd by the m2, we're accounting for the money supply
so this is basically saying, this is the bitcoin chart if there was no inflation
and when you do see what the bitcoin chart would look like if there's no inflation, we've already capitulated below the alltime high
in my opinion, we are in a completely different environment than we have been previously
uh, bear in mind, you really would want to wait for, you know, daily candle body closes below, uh, 28 000 five hundred, twenty eight thousand six hundred
now, if we do want to see a rally up to thirty four thirty six, thirty eight thousand, in my opinion, it really needs to happen in the next couple of days
because coming into the fomc meeting, if they do increase the interest rates once again, we are very, very likely to drop
just a quick tidbit, if we check out the bitcoin dominance, bitcoin dominance is massively, massively breaking to the upside
this means that no matter if bitcoin price goes up or it goes down, bitcoin is going to be massively outperforming the old crimes
have been talking about this for the past month now, and we're finally seeing this macro break
be very, very cautious if you're in, if you're invested in old cranes right now
all the old btc charts like this, they look absolutely garbage
uh, i very, very much advise against investing in all queens while we're in a bear market
but you know, we really need to start waiting for daily candle
it doesn't matter what happens in the next, uh, next couple of days, the next four hours, eight hours
it really matters how we react to this price level, in my opinion
i really do not want to see a big move below there, especially a daily counter
so as you can see, bitcoin price has just gone down to twenty nine thousand seven hundred and forty four dollars
so you're going to see a lot of wikiness, big choppy price action as we go into this result
i'm going to try have a look on my phone as soon as it comes through
so will this lead to a break of this range low? well, we're just going to have to wait and see
you have price stuck below all important ema's and trending downwards
typically, the way that this works is you want to wait about 20 to 30 minutes after the results are out for all of the speculators to kind of let the dust settle, and then you can make your decision on which way you want to go
i still, personally, i'm leaning more bearish, leaning towards the 21k area, eventually being hit, or at least a retest of that 25 400 zone, which was our previous week lows
i would expect at least some sort of a test back down into that area
i wanted to touch on chain link because, uh, i mentioned on yesterday's stream, i said that it does seem like it's topping out over here, and i definitely wouldn't be chasing this higher high
and i mentioned that in the newsletter, as i said, wait for the pullback
and when i put on the ema's, i noticed that we also starting to get one of my perfect buy signals for a long term trade, which is the 50 and 200 ema golden cross
i know it might be a bit dark on this, but if i zoom in, it's over here, the purple, which is the 50, and then you have the blue, which is the 200 ema
i'm still looking to possibly take at least a spot long position on chain link when it gets into this area over here
and when i say this area, the perfect zone is gonna be anywhere between eight dollars and about eight dollars 50 cents, which you can see prices coming right into that zone
now we're going to form the next higher low somewhere within this region
if you start breaking below that, then you just need to watch the previous higher low, which is coming in at 750
if you start closing candles underneath that area, then we're probably going to be in a bit of trouble
but link is showing relative strength compared to the rest of the market
and then another chart that i wanted to look at, which is not looking so strong
i'm going to move it on to a three day and this is going to be ethereum against, uh, bitcoin
and when you take a look at this, you'll see that the main trend line over here, support trend line, was broken
and i think the next meaningful support is coming about 25 down from here
so anyway, depending on where in that box, between 20 and 30 percent down, uh, whether we're going to have a relief rally, first, reject
so whether we're going to come down like that, push up, reject and then come back down, that i'm not 100 sure of
but any sort of push into this region over here, i'd be looking to take shorts, not only on ethereum, but on the rest of the altcoin market
typically what you'll find is that ethereum is sort of, uh, an umbrella indicator for the rest of the altcoin market
so i think that the ultimate support is going to be found much, much lower
and that's also why i say that for, uh, bitcoin, i am still expecting those 21 to 23k levels to, uh, to materialize, which would take you into that zone over there
okay, i just want to go into one more chart, which is the b and b chart
i would imagine that, um, any of you that probably took a short position on this, uh, in the profit
so it seems like price is struggling to get anywhere above this underside resistance
i would probably be lowering my short level at the moment because it is struggling
so any sort of wick that manages to come into this underside resistance, i'd be adding to the short position over there
you can just kind of track that trend line, right? so with the yellow circle, i'm just tracking it down
so anywhere that you can get in within this zone, and that is going to be between eighty nine dollars and fifty cents and three hundred dollars for bnb, would be a short
those of you who already got your short entries, a lot of you messaged me on twitter and you said that you had, you had your entry secure
what should you do now? my advice would be just to hold that, just hold that short position
uh, you in the green already, and you may as well just write it down
when i looked at this this morning, it hadn't moved that high
and previously i'd marked this area out before price was in this region
so before we had even crossed these key quarterlies, i expected resistance, pushed straight through, deviated above, came back down, retested that key quarterly over here as support
and now that is confirmed support, and you have price pushing back up
it is extremely bullish on the dexi, the dollar index, meaning that people are moving their money into the dollar as a flight to safety
and until this shows any, uh, real signs of a pullback or weakness, there won't be any relief for crypto
so i would imagine this is going to tie in with when the fed pivots on the inflation rates
and this morning i was looking at this, it was already pushing up close to that next horizontal trend line, which is 10376
we've now wicked through it, and i'm pretty sure that over the next couple of weeks, we're probably going to be pushing straight through that
what i would say is, if you guys can just go onto my um youtube page over here
so on the crypto shorts channel, click in the description below, you'll see all my links to twitter
we can also put a card that will come up in the top over there
but all my links to my twitter and everything else is in there also
if you are going to be following along with any of these trades, one way that you can support me in the crypto banter community is to use the bibard link
so all you have to do is come into that, we'll say, uh by bit forward slash b forward slash kyle dupes
and then you can click on that and register yourself with an account as well
i asked the community whether they feel that market is going to be going up or down over the next couple of days
came in with 283 believed up 403 believe the market was going down, and 314 percent said sideways
so this is just my personal feeling or hypothesis, is that only when the market, when more than 80 percent of the markets start to make, uh, votes for the downside, and they think it's a sure thing that the market's going down, that is probably only when we see a bottom
and i run these polls every now and then, so follow me on twitter
it used to be more bullish, but you can see people are slowly starting to turn bearish
what we'll do is i'll go live again on monday, but i will keep you up to date over the weekend on twitter

[Music], what is up, my crypto legends? how is everyone doing? let's analyze the situation here for bitcoin guys
i actually started the live stream, i actually started the live stream thinking that i was live
i was speaking to my own here for almost five minutes, just talking and talking about the situation right now on bitcoin, about the bibit competition
it was me just being distracted and not hitting the live button
but most importantly, this live stream is going to be a very, very short one
okay? i wanted to get a video prepared, but it's just much easier to get a live stream
i want to do a quick analysis on bitcoin, just to show you what is going on here
we've absolutely broken out from this major support level here of the twenty nine thousand three hundred dollar range
it does look like that we are going lower expect a potential bounce at twenty eight thousand five hundred, twenty eight thousand six hundred
okay, in between that level we should be getting a potential bounce
okay? we have so many, kind of, many candles here closing at this level, it's potentially going to get a small, small bounce
all right? at this range, 28 500, which is the closes here that we did create the 27th and 28th of may, and also here on the 18th and 19th of may, a close and open
so a potential, quick bounce from this range, where you could take an opportunity, is very, very likely
now, this is going to come to lower levels, by the looks of things
okay? even though we get a shortterm bounce here, in the immediate, short term, if we start trading here right above, uh, around about the 29 300, if we do get that bounce, this is very likely going to roll back down
if you do consolidate, get a couple of wicks in the next coming hours, a couple of days, it's very likely to roll down from these levels
okay? once we we saw this spring point above the major resistance, right? get people extremely bullish, uh, getting above the resistance
remember, we were extremely bearish on the channel at these levels
and this was exactly what i thought was going to happen, right? where we're going to hit this major highs, okay, these last lower highs, and get this, you know, kind of consolidation inside of this range
now, why do i think this is likely to come to lower levels? just because, you know, this is a absolute trap
okay? this gets people very, very bullish, and it's a big, big trap
and what is likely going to happen is that we're finally going to break these low lows of 28 600, after potentially getting a quick short term bounce, and then go to lowe's levels in the next coming days and retest the 25 000 level
this was the bull trap zone, okay? and stay super, super cautious now, the 28 500, 20 600, we can expect a potential bounce
but most importantly, why is the bitcoin price dropping? one of the main reasons why is because of the dxy
we're also talking about, you know, the possibility of the dxy, you know, creating a lower height, or a double top scenario
remember, we've been following these, kind of, uh, this massive, big uptrend with these higher lows, trend line, as you can see, going parabolic at some point
but this doesn't mean that you are going to continue, you know, you are going to create a downtrend, right? we're looking at that potential retest of this support
so we could come and break the alltime high here on the dollar, sorry, not the alltime high, this high over here, and actually retest this zone and create a double top, all right? or slightly higher high, or slightly lower high, and then get that correction
and of course, um, this is also the possibility in creating a double bottom on bitcoin, retesting the 24 25 000 area
the reason why i'm making this live stream is because of the world series of trading
but i need you to scroll down, whoever's interested in trading, the trading
the competition starts from the 27th of june, until the 17th of july

okay, i'm going to be, you know, 24 7, sharing a little bit of knowledge, sharing a bit of levels
basically, we'll be focusing on bitcoin, but we'll be also focusing on ethereum and some altcoins
not much, but we are going to do some altcoins, definitely, uh, from the top 20 or top 30 that can be traded on by bit to, you know, be in the top 10 at least
okay, i'm gonna aim to win the competition, but we're going to try and be at least in the top 10 guys
if the competition would have started at these levels, i mean, it would have been absolutely crazy, because we lo longed all the way up here, shorted all the way up down here
i've been taking a little bit of a break because i was happy, you know, i did take a trade yesterday that i took a small loss
that didn't happen to to have that, you know, this, um, this guardly pattern, it was well overextended on fibonacci time
okay, we was just consolidating here, at this level, exited at a small loss
you know, this is why i exited, because the timing was just too too much
so exit the position because, yeah, basically it was just taking too much
we need to cut down losses and make huge percentage gains on trades
and also the same here, you know, already get taking profits, waiting to get into this last moment on this potential short, expecting a bounce here, but we did not get about
so actually actually riding the short all the way down to these levels
so we need to find these opportunities for the trading competition
and if you are going to join the trading competition, join the telegram group
we're going to be extremely active from the 27th of june, 24 7, sharing charts, sharing opportunities to absolutely crush it in the competition
user registration is from the 10th of june to the 27th of june
and the competition starts from the 27th till the 17th of july
if you want to join my team, it's going to be absolutely huge
we've got the telegram also down below in the video description, so you can join the telegram, because it's going to be really, really active
this live stream is basically just because of this, guys, because yeah
we just want to get as much people as possible that are interested and, you know, in getting a huge prize, because i'm really going to focus, you know, on in the competition to to be in, you know, in the top 10
i'm going to go to win it, but let's get into the top 10 at least
all right? for this competition is going to be absolutely amazing
like i said, you know, this is a kind of a distribution event
remember, we were eyeing something very, very similar from december, okay, of december, december, december of 2021
okay? this is a kind of a spring point, just slightly getting to the to the resistance zone here
so it's very, very likely, okay? after this spring point, after hitting this major resistance zone that, you know, now confirming this le these levels, that we are going to going to come down
you know, i was bearish or anyway, i was looking for that leg up and shorting from the highest point, of course, because, you know, inside of this consolidation, um, because we are in a downtrend, of course, you know, there's slightly higher probability and just continuing down
but we want to get into the best levels, right? you want a short here
you want the biggest gains and the less risk to reward, the the less the risk
you know, you know the deal, uh? we i i shorted here and i shorted here
but this was also an insane short position, hitting that major daily level
if we do come down there, expect, you know, a little bit of volatility and a big wick to the upside
we got a major daily level, okay? from 18th, 19th of may, and also the 27th of may, daily close and open
expect some kind of small relief rally for then continuation to the downside
if that does happen, all the way up to the 29, 400, 500, you know that
and consolidate at this range, it's also going to be a major short opportunity
but you know, we want to get into the, into the best levels, right? we want to get into the best levels, not just randomly short at this range
just in case you do get that those big spikes to the to the upside, if you're using a little bit of too much leverage
it was pretty fun to ask the community last week, do you think the dxy is going to go to much lower levels? i think it was over 65 percent of people were saying, yeah, the xy is going lower
and, um, yeah, basically not after this consolidation, dxy is absolutely exploding
but in my opinion, it will get exhausted, of course, at some point in the coming weeks, retesting the highs, retesting this high low, major resistance trend line
and this will be the moment, you know, where it's going to be extremely bearish
once you have joined, guys, you need at least, you need at least 500 usdt
and after joining the link competition, all right, the link is in the comment section right now
after joining the team, join the telegram, which is also in the description of this live stream

okay, today, the 10th of june, is the opening of this so i had to dedicate a live stream for this competition
this live stream is only for this competition with an 8 million prize pool

is it gonna lose? finally, this one thousand seven hundred hundred dollars
we will be doing a live stream doing full focus on bitcoin and also ethereum and other cryptocurrencies
like i said, this live stream was just to have as much people inside of the vivit competition
we have a registration for 17 days, so i'll be talking a little bit on every live stream or video
we need to gather up huge amount of people, all right, that are willing to trade and willing to, you know, make insane trades
we got 17 days to for the registration, and we've got, you know, from the 27th of june to the 17th of july to trade, guys, and absolutely crush it
we got some major levels here at the 28, 500, 600, where we could get a small relief rally
we've got major resistance at eight thousand, twenty, nine thousand, four hundred dollars
if we get that reaction, you know, it might be a good shorting level
also, very likely that we are going to have continuation to the downside, to retest the 25 000 area in the next coming days, couple of weeks
very, very likely it's gonna get lost in the coming days, and we're gonna come lower
tomorrow, i'm gonna do a full two hour live stream to check out, for, you know, the the, you know, good trading probabilities on ethereum and on bitcoin, mainly
but, like i said, this live stream was only focused to get as much people in for this competition
tomorrow, saturday, twohour live stream to do full analysis on bitcoin, crypto and some, you know, different markets
also, thank you guys for joining this live stream, and i will see you in the next one
in this episode, i want to show you here the weekly chart with bitcoin, showing you how the possibility on bitcoin coming down to 12 000 range, you know, it is very, very real, especially if we do have a multiyear recession, okay, worldwide, then this could push the price of assets down, and also cryptocurrency, of course
this will actually be one of the best buying opportunities in history of bitcoin, knowing that it's very, very likely going to go up in value after the potential big correction
what i want to do is focus also on the weekly chart and zoom in here on the price action, all right, for the last few years, and talk about the biggest major levels here that we do have as resistance and support
okay? knowing that that thirty thousand, twenty nine thousand dollar range has been a huge support level, we're going to talk about the big, major levels that we do have slightly beneath us
and we also focus in here on the two hourly chart, the one hourly chart, focusing on the big levels that we can see some major opportunities in the next coming hours and days, guys
new to the channel? make sure to subscribe daily to your bitcoin crypto
let's zoom out to find out where we are here with a bitcoin guys
but right now, for the last, you know, one to two years, we are in this sideways action, you know, having this corrective move
and this could still be, you know, for another six months or 18 months, all right, approximately, in my personal opinion
now, we do need to understand that the current worldwide situation is not the best, and we could actually see a kind of a big recession right in the next, you know, 6, 18 months, even 24 months
guys, we do not need to be scared, because bitcoin is in a very huge macro uptrend, if you know, and this is extremely good if we do have those big corrections to the downside
i remember investing all the way back here in 2018, seeing these major corrections, and people were absolutely panicking
i did know that the bitcoin price was going to go up in value
so if we did have that, you know, possibility of bitcoin actually going down to twenty thousand, or even twelve thousand dollars
now we do have the biggest spike on the vpvr at the twelve thousand dollar range
looking at the volume traded for the last four to five years, as you can see on the chart
now, this was a big, major resistance zone, as you can see, on bitcoin, this 12 000 region
so it's definitely, in my opinion, gonna be one of the lowest levels for bitcoin
if we were to see bitcoin at those levels, it's going to be, you know, a big, big buying opportunity
now, of course, it's not certain that we are going to go down to this range
but it is true that the volume traded in between twelve thousand dollars all the way up here to sixty thousand dollars
you know, it was a very, very fast move to the upside because of the amount of demand, the amount of hype that there was
now, if we are going to become really, really bearish in the next coming months, then, yeah, you know, the possibility is there
of course, this is not guaranteed that we're going to go down there, but if it does, it's going to be one of the best buying opportunities in my personal opinion
now, let's just focus on here, on the weekly chart, okay, and zoom in a little bit, and let's see the last, you know, two years to see, you know what, if we do lose this major range over here, i'm just going to zoom in here till, you know, from late 2022, this price action here to the upside, and the price action that we've been going sideways in between 2021 and 2022
now, what i want to make you understand here is that the thirty thousand dollars has been the strongest support, all right, for the last two years
you can clearly see here, 2021, we've been holding this range as support
okay, for the last few weeks we have which down below, as you can see on the weekly but we managing to close several weekly candles at this level, showing the amount of support that this range is
your potential big relief rally or balance from this range is very, very possible
and then potentially having another attempt, and then once you come back down, to retest it again after that major balance
of course, we could actually break it in the next coming months
now, what if we do actually break the zone in the coming weeks? what happens if we do close a weekly candle below this range? well, just by showing you the vpvr, we have a huge, massive, big candle here from bitcoin, okay, created in december of 2020
we did have a major stop here, looking at the daily chart, and a huge amount of volume was created
we do know that we do like to bounce from major vp, uh, vpvr spikes
you know, i can just show you one example, right over here at the 48 000 where we were looking for that shorting opportunity here back in march
looking at that spike on the vpvr, we actually touched it and had that retracement
okay, so there's no doubt here, all right, that, um, these spikes are very, very significant on the vp
we are showing you the huge amount of volume traded at that price level
so the 24 000 range, if we were to come down to that level, we could expect a large consolidation and some big relief rallies where we could take advantage of the market
okay? don't be be extremely scared when the price action has a big drop to those levels, because it's very, very likely going to get a big, fat bounce
this is why it is important to have these levels marked and be, you know, waiting for a reaction to jump in a potential trade
now, the next level below that, of course, is the 20 000 region
no doubt in my mind, if this 24 000 level is broken, there will be a big, big bounce from this range
okay, just a little bit of a scenarios here, looking at some major levels on the weekly
i want to talk about bit get, crypto trading platform gaining massively in popularity, end in volume
if you go to the coin gecko ranking here, they are top four on futures trading and top seven on spot trading
if you sign up with my link down below in the description, there's up to five thousand dollars worth of bonus to be claimed
the three steps to claim the rewards, you need to sign up, login on bitget, click deposit and claim the rewards
okay, here are the steps to claim up to five thousand dollars with a bonus
now, something really cool about bitget is that they have innovative products that i want to go through it right now
don't have to worry about security, and excellent customer service
now, on the top here, you have the reward center where you can claim your bonuses
now, if you go here, they have futures trading and spot trading, very similar, very easy, friendly to use
but something a very, very nice of bit get is the spot grid trading and future grid trading
if you click on spot grid trading, basically, if you do not know what grid trading is, you basically want to buy low and sell high
let's just go with a btc usdt pair, and you have an ai strategy and manual creation
of course, if you want to create your own manual, create uh strategy here, you have a, if bitcoin is trading inside of a range, you know, you can put the high level where to sell and the low level where to buy here also
and create your own manual creation here with advanced setting
make sure to follow the actual steps here to have that creation or you can just actually follow the ai strategy, all right, which just doesn't, you know, guarantee future results
parameters are based on back testing of history records and does not represent future revenue
so here you can choose, you know, the percentage of your capital to actually test this ai strategy
that is something really, really cool here that bitget has got
also, they do have the copy trading, which is absolutely phenomenal
they have a huge amount of traders here, all right, for copy trading
now, i wouldn't be, uh, looking the percentage here of the copy trade
but the copy traders are actually losing money, as you can see here
so i would just search for someone not with high percentage, all right, on return on investment, because they can actually inflate these percentage by just risking a couple of cents
all right, with some pretty nice, you know, look at this one over here, contents
he has total p l of 1 524, and he has copy traders and absolutely huge gains

so these are the two really cool features that get does have, okay, the spot grid and future grid trading and copy trading
remember, you have an insane bonus of up to five thousand dollars, all right, to claim down below by signing up with the link in the description
because, hang on, in one second, let's take a look at the 30 minute chart
because yesterday we were talking about a potential trading opportunity
we were talking about, you know, there's probably going to be a huge amount of sideways action
we were talking about this guardly pattern, all right, on the 30minute chart, that if we were to have more few hours, all right, supposedly this could have a leg up here, all the way up here to the 312 thousand dollars
but what happens here that we were probably going to extend here in fibonacci time, and this is not going to be a valid pattern
all right? we did have a few hours since i created the live stream, and yeah, i did exit my trade that i had
and i did, you know, exit my trade on a slight loss, because it was just over extended
it would have been nice, you know, at this moment, to see that price action to the upside, all right, to hit that 312 for potentially looking a shorting opportunity
i'm going to talk about their major resistance levels right now
so this trade was absolutely invalidated because of the amount of extension, okay, of sideways action on fibonacci time, looking for this garlic pattern that did not play out
and also, i want to remind you, you need to subscribe to the channel, because i will be doing a live stream afterwards, and i will be showing you, okay, the trading competition that is going to be live very, very soon
let's take get this out of the way and talk about what is happening right now on bitcoin
right here on the two hourly, there's no doubt that we are in a very aggressive downtrend
and we have been respecting this trend line, as you can see on the chart
so if the price of bitcoin were to have a big, massive pump, maybe hitting that 311, 313 k levels, there is a huge amount of resistance
why is there a huge amount of resistance? if i take a look at the volume traded for the last couple of months
we got the value area high right over here at the 30 500 range
as you can see, this has been a major, major level where we have had resistance and support many, many times
if we were to break this zone a little bit and go all the way up here, you we know that we do have big resistance here
if i zoom out on the daily, it's been very much respected this level, as you can see on the chart
and you can see on the four hourly that we just touched that range and had that big, major correction
it's super important to have these levels marked up to see the potential rejection or bounces
but if we do break it, we can clearly see that this 31 300 range, 311, 313, okay? give or take a couple of hundred dollars, uh
because of the volatility, we could see this reaction, okay? we could see a similar reaction creating also another lower high guys
if we start reacting at this level, okay? if the bitcoin price does pump to this range and gets a reaction, it might be a good shorting opportunity
we got the trendline from the lower highs, as you can see on the chart
now, my opinion, by looking at the chart right now, after this huge, log large consolidation, it is, this is no man's land
if it does come up like this with, you know, some huge momentum and starts getting rejected, i will notice that it's very, very likely going to continue down downtrend
so there's much more opportunities here if we do have that leg up
i know most of the time people, you know, when the price pumps, you know, you're looking like really bullish, really hyped up
and if the price dumps, then, you know, you're getting like, really depressed
okay, so for the selling opportunities, you know, i would be eyeing that consolidation at the 311, 313
it does look like that we are creating this descending triangle
if this level is successfully broken, we want to see a nice one hourly, two hourly candle, okay, even four hourly candle, even better
close below this level, then you could see that this range is very likely going to be heavy resistance and continue back down
so, but what is the biggest level below that range? so if we do break it, you know, if we do have a solid breakout, you know, where does that break out is going? where is that breakout going to stop? well, i can show you right over here, the value area low from the volume traded, okay, for the last, you know, two months, approximately, just a month? no, sorry, just about one month and and five, ten days approximately, as you can see here on the chart
okay, looking at may and june, we can see that the value area low is at twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
so if we were to break this support level that we did create, it's very likely to get a reaction
if we start consolidating at this range, you could expect a relief rally
okay, maybe to continue back down and finally break this level
there's going to be some major opportunities here if you do have those consolidations, guys
because if you do not consolidate, we can slice through these levels
remember, it's always nice to see some consolidations, all right, of a few hours to know that that level is having a reaction
and it's very likely that the balls are going to step in if you do react
all the bears are going to step in if you do react at this resistance
okay, these are the major levels that i want to show you here on the price of bitcoin, make sure to subscribe
let's see if we can do some live trading and check out some opportunities
check out the bitcoin centers website for the latest news and technical analysis ideas
the latest article is, can the percentage of global bitcoin adoption increase by 2030? check out the article guys on the bitcoin sensors website down below
so one second before i see what right today we will have, hello
how are you? hola, is everyone feeling great this morning? uh, sorry
well, you can go in and like the live stream so we can reach out to more people and help other people also see the market the way we do
how are you? in swedish we say, how are you? we say, uh, how are you? means you guys, like all of you
good christine, how are you? i hope everyone is feeling great
so i can definitely expect the market to have some big movements today
and if we go back in time, we, you, or at least how i see it, usually when the market has been very slow, and we've been seeing bitcoin being very slow during these last couple of days, uh, this way last couple of days
can expect the market to, uh, to, uh, at least have some movements, uh, today, bigger than the ones we've had these last couple of days, because the market has just been going sideways
yes, exactly, alexander, that's what i also believe will happen
we have a resistance around, uh, 31 267, and the high, we also have the high of the week at 32 000, and the burst is there
so we can definitely see the market try to break this, uh, resistance, just to to make people think the market will go up
but remember that we also have this, um, this weekly and daily trend line that we're just bouncing against
um, so we can definitely see the market try to break the level
uh, maybe just with a quick, uh, week on the lower time frames, or only come back up and retest either the trendline or the resistance
but i definitely believe that we will have a dump coming today
i do believe that, uh, at least we just might not come back down all the way to 2300
but i definitely believe that we will see some volatility to the downside
well, going to the weekly chart, if you want, if you want bitcoin to change direction, you kind of need to break this high, because this is the last lower high that we that we got
so even if we would see a huge pump, we can still come back up
but overall, we still need to break above for the seven thousand and six hundred for us to even think about us being in a valid uptrend
because you can, you could definitely, in the future, see the market pull back up to this level and then start see the market reverse back down
so there's a lot of levels that we need to break before, uh, bitcoin
uh, change direction, because the direction is on its way down
um, i mean, it can, can definitely break to the upside, you and start to continue to do high highs and higher lows
i can be completely wrong too, but that is why we use the technical tools to see where the where the market is respecting
uh, we we're using the, um, the trend line, to see if we break the trend line
because the trendline is really, really, really, really important
but remember, today so that the thing that i wanted to talk to is that 2 30 pm, during new york session, we will have usd coming out with some news
uh, we saw the market came up exactly yesterday to my, my entry
can you see how perfectly it came back up? and we tested that exact same level
but i did sell the market based on a, i did sell the market based on a fibonacci level
so the market usually comes back to the same fibonacci levels and and retest it again
so we can go to dxi and see what, uh, the dollar dollars have done
and this was a previous report that i thought we could possibly come back up and retest for then see the market drop
and what we can do is that we're dragging fibonacci from 102446 back up to 103336
um, uh, 102887, or potentially one hundred two point seven hundred and eighty six
so maybe during a london session now we see the pullback, and do during new york session we see that, we see the push
now you can see the market, uh, on bitcoin ethereum, we just might have a little push to the upside, fake out, and then you see the drop
how are you? uh, joseph, how are you fine? it was a little bit late
how are you? uh, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so we can, if you can help a girl the channel, would be super sweet
so, but if we're looking at ethereum, i'm gonna take some things away so it looks better
so when we're looking at ethereum, you see, uh, this is the previous lower uh, yesterday someone late, and today you're late
so this fibonacci that i have from 1994 back down to the low at 1773
if we drag another fibonacci, i think this was the one that, um, okay, so i drag another fibonacci now on b on ethereum, from 1906 back down to the low at 1752
if we see some movement to the upside, you can definitely see us pull back up, potentially to 1828
uh, if we have a bigger, uh, move eight, one thousand eight hundred and forty seven
but we could definitely see market pull back up to these levels
and then, as you guys already know, i do believe we will continue back down
market can definitely continue to the other direction too, right? but if this fibonacci is valid, uh, the the take profit one is one thousand seven hundred and fourteen
uh, where's lauren brain of crypto? i don't know where she's maybe she's taking a nap
i guess this one? well, i guess is it the one? oh well, oh, well, i don't know
let's see, what else? what other point? okay, so we went through dxy
if you have, if you hear a lot of things in the background, um, [Music]
if you hear a lot of things in the background, it's only because they building certain things around around the house
so we are inside a also, of course, a sideways market on uh xrp
the the resistance is around zero point four thousand two hundred and fifty, and the support is around one, uh, zero point three thousand eight hundred, around that level
if we would see a break of the resistance, we can pull back up to zero point four thousand four hundred and sixty six, or zero point four thousand six hundred and twenty two and that could be the drop back down if we break the support trend line
we can also just come back up to the resistance and then see the drop either way
if we break the support, the next target is zero point three thousand five hundred and fifty
and the wick adds zero point three thousand three hundred and thirteen
if we see a bigger drop, we can obviously also come back down to the the next let's see
so i think this level is great because if we go back in time, you can see that this is a previous support and resistance zone
so if we see the drop, we can definitely come back down to take profit 2 that we have on this um, on this, uh, fibonacci
hello, ben, how are you? uh, thor arnold is here, right? natalie, good morning
i'm just looking at the chat to see who's in here and what you want me to look at
okay, we looked at um, uh lu luna sir, is this the one? i just like this one better
does it look like i don't have energy today? well, maybe i don't
that is why it's really important that people know how to use your energy
don't give it we we need to be protective of the energy, you know
so if we see that, we only come back down for a potential retest around 6613
you could see the market pull back up a little bit more, maybe to the previous report that we do have at 9 305
and but if we see the market break below the previous higher low, because remember, we tried to break a previous trend line
if we break below it, and if we break below the higher low around 6386, that could be the beginning back down again to the support at 4 67
you just might also come back down to 4 thousand, at two thousand, four hundred and twenty six
not pause for 20 seconds for those who have not liked, yes, guys, if you haven't liked the live stream already, uh, already
if you are a beginner, crypto trading for beginners is the best one
i always recommend part uh, market structure, part one and part two
this is something that everyone needs to do if you want to become a good trader
uh, this is just the way you if you want to become a good, uh, musician, or whatever you want to be good at, you obviously need to practice, um, like this
oh, but if you want to become a good football player, you obviously need to go to the field, you need to kick the bulb, etc, etc
so some people ask me before, what is back testing? back testing is when you go into the charts and you you use previous price prices to understand what can happen now
so that is why you should go in and look at these back testing streams with me that i've had before
i also will have it during this weekend, because i think it's really good to go into the charts when the market is very slow, so you're not so focused on, okay, what happens now? should i sell or buy? because i know a lot of people don't have that patience
that will all obviously grow with time, because in the beginning you're very greedy, you want money, etc
but that is why during the weekends, when the crypto market is very slow, it's good to go to back test it
and then during the week we can go back in and see what type of trades we can take
and if you don't have structure when it comes to back testing, it's also very good to see
because i remember when i started to back test, i was like, what should i do? i have no clue what i'm doing
and so subscribe to the channel, hit the notification so you know when i do have my live streams, my daily updates, because from monday to friday, i always have, uh, a livestream session
and from monday to next friday, i will be at eight o'clock, precisely eight o'clock, so you don't have so you don't waste your time waiting for me
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is a platform where it's very good for swing traders, when you want to hold your position for a longer time with very low fees, which is really, really, really good
five times a day, practice and follow all of her wisdom of trade, will become a better you're so sweet
um, so we do have a, i'm gonna, i'm gonna share, uh, i i cannot share it through the computer
oh, this time every single day, marina, the one that you're in, my time
you can go inside and follow those and, but if you also want to be part of bitcoin census community, we got two different chats
we have one big chat, but we also have a smaller chat where i, um, let people be more in contact with me
and we have super great traders in this one that helps people so much
um, this is a chat where you obviously show respect to each other, and we don't talk about things that has nothing to do with just you being polite to other people or trading, obviously
but we've seen people now starting become so so, so, so, so good in trading by just being on this chat, because they help each other so much
so if you want to have people, uh, if you want, if you want to help people, if you want to be helped by people, if you just want to talk to people about trading, or have a community, this is definitely the best community for you
and we also have one, we have so many great traders, but we also have a guy called smoking joel
i'm so privileged to have such a great trader, such a great man in that community that helps with everything
i'm sorry that i will go into the charts, but when it comes to trading, there's no joke when it comes to trading, trading, this is not easy
that is why i try to help you as much as i can, because i know exactly how hard it is
but to have someone like smoking joe, who's very straightforward, we need that because we, we cannot tell you fairy tales when it comes to trading, because there's no fairy tale in trading
because there there's nothing fun with us telling you, hey, it's super easy, and then you're gonna lose your money
and if someone tells you trading is easy, they're just lying to you, because it's not
so that is why i'm super happy that i have smoking joe, because he's very straightforward, always very polite, but he tells you to choose
well, it's a little bit harsh, but it's like it when it comes to training
i remember when i started to trade, i was like, i can earn this much money on trading
okay, natalie, for you to become a good trader, you have to practice this every single day, 24 7
you will need to question every aspect within yourself to even be able to find the emotional balance when it comes to the charts
so for someone to come and say that trading is is simple, every it's different for everyone
but trust me, when when good traders you you don't hear anyone say trading is easy
the only ones that say trading is easy are the ones that do not know how to trade
but i think a lot of people here already know that trading is not easy, but it's totally worth the time
but that is why you should go into the community, because this is where we try to help each other
because i needed the help when i started, so i definitely want to help other people
i want to help other people with the help um that i would want when i started
but you already know that i do believe that we will come back down, uh, to the low of the week
but if we just go back in time and see this is, this is where the market found a support for this huge bounce that we didn't have to the upside um
and the same thing here, when we see the break of structure, we need to break the higher time frames last lower high
and can you see how the market broke this level? and then, sorry, in another well, we did come back down and retested it on the lower time frames
and that is the exact same thing that we need here for us to be able to say that, hey, we're actually in a downtrend, right or breaking to the upside so in this case, if we want to see, uh, ltc and all of the other coins, uh, being uh, bullish again, we need to break this, uh, last lower high
can you see the connection? on a downtrend the way you saw here? lower high, lower high
but this is the one that we need to break for us to be able to say that we are in the uptrend
now, just want to make you see the the concept of us being bullish and bearish
but if we zoom into what's happening, so what i did on the daily, uh, just to make sure that i understand why we are down here
i took the fibonacci from 69693, back down to to this low at 627 market, came back up a couple of days ago, and retested that level
uh, my morning has been brightened for the third morning in a row
can you see how perfectly i say this every time? but no one can lie
you saw the close of the 50 and the retest of the 618 percent is so beautifully take take profit
can you see how the minus point, uh, 12 is almost precisely combined with this wick? it's beautiful
but we can obviously see the market giving us some, um, [Music] a pullback now
so we drag a fib first of all, we're going to drag it from 6 to 16, back down to the low at 595
uh, these fibonacci levels that i do have can be support, uh, other levels where the market will retest
i don't use them as much, but they can definitely be a a guideline
but if we start to see bigger momentum to the upside, we can go to the four hourly chart, and we can just drag up the fibonacci either to 6251
and if we do that, the 50 is so com is exactly combined with minus 023, and that is at, oh yeah, 61 dollars
so we can definitely see during today, uh, a retest of this level
and that is also a retest of the of this, the support and the sideways market that we had
so this is the first level that i i can see us pull back down to
uh, if we have another bigger movement, we drag it up to this high at 645, which means we can retest 62 dollars or 625 dollars
is there a video? i'm actu i will actually create a fibonacci so many people have asked me about it, and i'm actually gonna do it now
so i if i do a, okay, if we have, okay, so if we have, it's only 146 right now, but if we have 200 people like this live stream, i will create a fibonacci during this weekend, a fibonacci tutorial, how i use it
but if we have, that is only if we have 200 like likes on this live stream, you know
everyone like the livestream, you can go in and create, you know, another another account if you want to nat attack
where's d if if people like 300, she will be my personal teacher
so looking at solana, we are about, sorry, we are below a previous resistance
it's always good, especially on the higher time frames, it is always, always, always, really good too
if we are below a previous support and resistance zone, um, if you just drag it a little bit back to the left, this was also a fake outlet a fake out level
this is a previous, uh, support and resistance zone, or a zone
go down to the lower time frames and just try to adjust it a little bit, because the box is too strong
so what we can do? oh, can you see how perfectly these ones the same thing read uh, support came back down, retested it from below, and we are still below this resistance trend line
so if we have the push to the upside, because we can expect the market being a little bit bullish, now, we can come back up and retest the fibonacci level at 4260 or 4364, or only the 50
but we will also try to break the the trend line, which the market usually have trouble to do
and then, uh, when we break it, usually what happens, you see the market close below the trend line again
okay, so sleeping golden really wants us to have a fibonacci um video this weekend
so if 200 people like the video today, on this live stream, i will give you guys a full tutorial of how i use the fibonacci
and with that tutorial, maybe i should not do that one, because you will never be on my live streams
i would, i would love, this is something that i would love if we have a, if bitcoin senses have a, like, an event where we invite everyone to a place, i don't know, but this is just like something that i would want, and everyone can just meet up, and i just want to see all of your faces
and i definitely, definitely want to see and hear the journey of yours
so overall, when we look at aave, uh, what i did? i drag fib from 159 back down to 77
okay, so we are on the daily the higher low is is a zone right here, because it was also from, oh yeah, you saw this huge push
but based on that, i still believe that we will see the market pull back down
but this is definitely a level at 104 and 105 dollars where you could possibly see the market reverse back down
if this is the case, if this fibonacci level is valid, take profit one would be nine to two
overall, of course, i still believe that we could have a push back down to, yeah, can you see? minus 12 is exactly combined with this low
but i definitely believe that we can come back down to 64, too
and i i shared it before, but i don't, i don't share my fibonacci settings because i bought this from a guy named kent
and i don't want to give out something for free when someone worked so hard for that
i would love to do it, but my respect, i learned so much through him, and i don't want to take away his hard work to give it for free on youtube
um, i i need to respect my, my mentors, because he was a great mentor, mentor of mine
i'm not sure if there was anything before this, but, oh, okay
so if you're looking at you and f e uni, you, um, we are in a sideways market right now, as you already know
if we break the support around seven point eight hundred and nine eight and seven point nine hundred, we can pull back down to seven point one hundred
if we break the resistance nine point five hundred and fifteen, we can pull back up to one, ten point nine hundred
and then we can pull back down and retest these highs at six point, uh, two hundred and fourteen
i need to end this live stream right now, because i need to go, uh, to twitter
we have different platforms, we have different social medias, and twitter is one of them where me and andy and our beautiful sammy is, uh, taking care of sam is the the one that taking care of it most
but me and andy come in here here and there, and we give out daily content about the chart
if you're new to the channel, go inside and subscribe to it, because i do have these morning live streams every single day from monday to friday, eight am, swedish time
and you also have the back testing sessions with me that you can go in and watch
you have short analyzes, but the best ones is the crypto trading for beginners, where i this is the educational, uh, videos that i do have
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to 4 050 by using the link in the description down below the video
and one, one, one if you don't know, some people don't believe in this, but i do not care, because i know it's true
it is the portal for you to be able to say, hey, god, universe, whatever you believe in, this is what i want
i want this to happen when you manifest that with one one one, if you truly believe it, it will happen
because you think you're in my live streams because you want to become a very good trader, hopefully
treat others with respect, because you always want respect to yourself
but you have to give, you have to give out what you want yourself, because otherwise karma's coming back for you
my name is josh, and the inflation numbers today just came in worse than expected
and this also caused crypto to pull back as well, and ethereum specifically, breaking below key support
but bitcoin, on the other hand, is holding up relatively well
and i'll be talking about all of that and so much more later in this video
first of all, before we get into the charts today, we need to talk about inflation, because the cpi data just came in today, and long story short, it was worse than expected, based on consensus and the trading economics forecast, which were both predicting an 83 yearoveryear inflation rate when the new cpr data came out today
but instead, what we actually got today was an 86 yearoveryear inflation rate, which is actually the highest we've seen in around four decades
now, if consensus and the trading economics forecast were only off by around 01 or 02, meaning that if inflation was at around 84 or 85, it wouldn't have been so bad, because it would mean that march was potentially still a peak in inflation at 85
but because we have 86 inflation year over year right now, this is now a new peak in inflation, higher than what we saw back in march
which now obviously tells us inflation definitely did not peak in march, like jerome powell actually said
in fact, jerome powell, who is the chair of the federal reserve, basically said that inflation has already peaked back in march, and now we're beginning a slow decline in inflation
so what does all of this mean for markets? and we're basically having this increased inflation rate coming in with the recent cpr data, means there's now an increased chance of the federal reserve being more aggressive with their interest rate hikes and tightening monetary policy
but the next couple interest rate hikes are most likely going to be 50 basis point hikes anyway, with now the slightly increased possibility of a 75 basis point hike
and based on market expectations, the next few 50 basis point hikes have basically already been priced into the markets
but a 75 basis point hike may not have been priced in yet, which means we could see more downwards pressure if we do end up seeing a 75 basis point hike as a result of this increased inflation figure
that not many were expecting, based on consensus and the trading economics forecast
so we will have to wait and see what happens at the next fed meeting, which is actually next week
so definitely make sure you subscribe to this channel with notifications on so you do not miss out on these update videos
make sure to follow me over on my twitter for realtime updates outside of these videos
and the link to my twitter is in the description down below, and also in the pinned comment
and looking at the effects that this bad news had on the stock market, this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily frame
we saw quite a decent dump in the stock market today and also yesterday, leading up to this event
and this recent dump in the stock market could be some investors starting to price in a possibility of a 75 basis point hike, or another 50 basis point hike, beyond what the market was expecting, like a 50 basis point hike later in this year
but of course, if you watched my video yesterday, as soon as the inflation numbers came out, you would have expected more downside price action, especially in the stock market
because what i said in yesterday's video is if inflation comes in above 83, that is where we could see some more bearish price action
but what is really interesting is, while the stock market is playing out a decent sized dump, the bitcoin price, on the other hand, is holding up relatively well
because, at least as of right now, at the time of recording this video, the price of bitcoin is still within this price range that we've been in basically over the past one month, compared to the stock market, which is almost reaching back down to its lowest points we've seen this year
and just before i get into the bitcoin and ethereum part of this video, i'll quickly mention the fact that there is a massive trading competition that only happens one time per year, and it's happening right now
the regular viewers here on the channel would know that i very rarely promote anything in these videos, so that you know that when i do shout something out in these videos, it is something that is worth your time
and so basically, this annual trading competition is the world series of trading
and there's up to an 8 million usdt prize pool this year as this massive price pool is split up between squads and individuals
and right now, i've already set up a squad in this competition named cryptoworld, and we already have eight members in this team
and if you scroll down the bottom of this page, you can see how the price money is actually distributed
and you can see right here that just by being a member of my crypto world team, if the crypto world team places well, then just by being a member in that team, you can actually get a share of this multimillion dollar prize pool if our team plays as well, once again
and then if you're one of the top traders in the team, you basically get more prize money if our team places in the prize money
and the more traders we have in our team, the more chance we have of winning this competition
and also, it's worth mentioning that the first 10 members that join the crypto world team get a free 10 and we already have eight members, so basically just the next two members that join get a free ten dollars
and all of the requirements to actually enter into the competition are listed on this page as well
and i'll have a link to this page in the description down below, and also in the pinned comment
and to join the team, you just sign into your bibit account and click this join button right here on the left
but i want to make it clear that this is not for complete beginners to crypto
this is more for those of you that have a little bit more experience in crypto and have a good idea of how prices move and have a good risk management and it is especially for those of you who trade crypto anyway
and once again, you can find a link to this page in the first link down below, in the description and in the pins comment
and looking at this fractal that we have, which is basically the price action we saw in the middle of last year, overlaid on top of the current bitcoin price action
and obviously, what we can see more recently is this fractal should not be used as a perfect bitcoin price prediction
instead, it should be used as more of a rough guideline for what we could expect moving forward for the bitcoin price
and basically what this is suggesting is potentially a bit more of a pullback, or at least more sideways consolidation for perhaps the next couple weeks or so, before we could experience any decent relief rally or recovery in the bitcoin price later on, perhaps in a month from now
and of course, this is only going off the bitcoin bottom that we saw in the middle of last year
so if you're taking a look at another significant bitcoin bottom, like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market, entering into early 2019, this is the price action that we have right here
and what is really interesting is this fractal suggests something similar for the next couple weeks or so
perhaps a bit more of a pullback, but not necessarily as much if we're following what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear markets
but otherwise, mostly sideways price action moving forward over the next few weeks or so, which is very interesting, because that's very close to what this fractal suggests, going off what we saw in the middle of last year and going off what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market
now if we look at what happens at the end of the 2014 bear market, this is what we get if we actually resize the 2014 to 2015 price action to fit what we're seeing right now
and this also suggests something similar going off the bottom that we saw at the end of the 2014 bear market, entering into 2015, which is essentially a lot more sideways consolidation with the possibility of a little bit more of a pullback here in the somewhat shorter term
and so the main thing all three of these fractals suggests is potentially more sideways press action, relatively speaking, with a bit more of a shortterm pullback is possible
and if you're zooming all the way out to the weekly bitcoin chart, taking a look at the 1 000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average and also the weekly bitcoin rsi, right now, the 1 000 day moving average is coming in at around 28 and a half thousand, and the 200 week moving average is coming in at around 223 k and historically speaking, almost every significant bitcoin bottom has occurred in between these two moving averages
talking about previous bitcoin bear markets and also the march 2020 crash, we saw the bitcoin price drop below the 1000 day moving average and bottom mounts closer towards the 200 week moving average
and two out of these three times, we saw the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories
but in the march 2020, example, we did not see the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories, despite the price action dropping all the way down to the 200 week moving average and actually wicking below that moving average very briefly
so technically speaking, according to pretty much the last decade of bitcoin's price history, and according to these important moving averages and the rsi, we technically do have a little bit more room to the downside
but keep in mind, the room to the downside isn't all that much compared to what we've already seen
because once again, the 1000 day moving average is coming in at around 28 and a half thousand
but historically, where we've bottomed out is closer towards the 200 week, which is sitting at around 22 to 23 000
and just taking a look at the shortterm bitcoin price action here on the fourhour chart, not a lot has happened over the past one day for bitcoin, despite the stock market playing out a decent sized dump
basically the main thing to talk about here is the fact that bitcoin has dropped below this shortterm line of support, sitting at around 29 and a half thousand
but other than that, we've got significant support at around 28 and a half thousand as well
we still have this short term line of resistance sitting at around 307 k and a more significant level of resistance at around 32 and a half thousand
and now getting into the ethereum parts of this video, this right here is the weekly ethereum chart, looking at the rsi in particular
this is almost entering into oversold territories for the first time since the end of the 2018 bear market
and that was the only other time in ethereum's entire price history where we saw the weekly ethereum rsi enter into oversold territories
so if this happens again, technically speaking, according to ethereum's entire price history, this is a very rare opportunity to be involved in the markets
but once again, we're not in oversold territories on the weekly chart just yet, which means, technically, there is still some room to the downside, like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market
and if you're zooming into the short term ethereum price action here, on the six hour time frame, you can see that we did break below an important level of support, which was sitting at around 1740 to 1750
and technically speaking, here on the six hour time frame, we have seen one confirmation with a candle close below this level of support at around 1740
and technically speaking, this is all we need for confirmation
but keep in mind, to be even more confident in the technical price target, which i'll mention in just a moment, we perhaps need to see a little bit more confirmation, such as a daily kindle close below 1700
or if we could potentially see a retest of this previous line of support and confirm it as new resistance, sitting at around 1740 once again, then in that case, that would just be extra confirmation of this break to the downside, giving us more confidence that the price target is most likely going to be met
but as of right now, with just one confirmation, there's relatively low confidence in the price target, even though this is clearly more bearish than bullish, obviously
and the technical price target for the breakdown out of this pattern is coming in at around fourteen hundred dollars per ethereum
and that fourteen hundred dollar price target would only get officially invalidated if we see a candle close back above this line of previous support, which is potentially acting as new resistance at around 1740 to 1750 once again
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum shorts positions on the bitfinex exchange here, on the weekly time frame, we've actually seen a decent bounce today in the short positions after reaching almost all time low levels, which basically means, with the bad inflation numbers we got today, we saw more money flow back into ethereum short positions on this exchange
but obviously, relatively speaking, these short positions are still very low, according to previous history
and if you're completely new to the channel and you want more information about what this means for ethereum, check out my last video on the channel
and now taking a look at the ethereum versus bitcoin charity on the daily time frame
because technically speaking, we do have a bullish divergence forming with lower lows in the price action, but higher lows in the daily rsi
but as of right now, this bullish divergence is yet to really kick in, because we're still seeing a decent amount of bearish momentum
but technically speaking, a bullish divergence means that we're due to see reduced burst momentum, for example, some sideways price action for ethereum versus bitcoin
but as i've been saying for a while now on the channel, ethereum vs bitcoin is in a much larger downtrend on larger time frames
and this right here is, relatively speaking, in the somewhat shorter term
and so when i'm talking about this possible bullish divergence, this is only talking about potentially over the next couple of days or so
but if you're a regular viewer here on the channel, especially in recent months, you would know that i have been bearish for ethereum vs bitcoin on the larger time frames, because right here we actually have a wyc off distribution pattern playing out
i won't be going too much into detail about all of that in this video, but basically, this is the wyckoff distribution schematic number two
and i'm sure you can see that this is basically what we're seeing at the moment for ethereum versus bitcoin here on the weekly time frame
it's wyckoff distribution playing out, which is basically a bearish pattern
and essentially we're entering into phase e of this pattern, where we could end up seeing a further retracement for the price of ethereum against bitcoin
which means ethereum could continue underperforming against bitcoin on the larger time frames
and in terms of a possible price target to the downside, i'll be taking a look at our fibonacci retracement tool from this swing low back in september of 2019 up to the swing high
as you can see that with this weekly candle, we're basically breaking below the 236 fibonacci level and potentially on our way down to the 382 fibonacci level, which is the second most important fibonacci level
and that is basically the price that i am targeting for ethereum versus bitcoin, if this trend continues
and not only is this an important fibonacci level, it was also perfect to resistance back here at the beginning of 2021
and by the way, this 382 fibonacci level is coming into play at around 0046 bitcoin per ethereum
and obviously there is no guarantees when it comes to this, but if this price target does play out, we could potentially see another 19 to 20 drop for ethereum versus bitcoin, which basically means ethereum would be underperforming against bitcoin by 19
or another way of saying it is bitcoin could be outperforming ethereum by 19, if this does play out
and once again, if you've been on this channel for a couple months now, you would already know that i moved some of my ethereum holdings back into bitcoin back around here or so
i'm heavier into bitcoin, and i am very light on the rest of the old coin markets, because this is a time in the market where alt coins perform very badly, obviously
but of course, that is nothing you if you've been on the channel for a couple months now, because this is basically everything that i've been talking about over the past one to two months, especially
and make sure to check out one of these uploads popping up right here on your screen if you want to maximize your profits in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so this is where we're going to take a look at the daily market structure and discuss what's likely to occur over the next upcoming days
as always, drop a like, subscribe if you're new and you enjoy this content
and if you're interested, you have links provided in the description of this video as well where you can join my public trading community
or if you'd like additional trading guidance, then you can join the private community
now, taking a look at the four hour time frame, bitcoin is in an incredibly messy position
over the last couple of days, the price action has been pretty choppy and quite volatile, to be honest, where we've bounced up and down a number of times between 29 000 and roughly 32 000
but whenever something like this occurs, instead of trying to force your analysis and and overthink these situations, sometimes it's good to zoom out a little bit and to get a bigger perspective on the larger market structure in order to have less noise
so this is where, if something like this is a bit confusing, you could go on the four hour or even on the daily to make more sense of what exactly is going on
so now, on the daily, the first thing that i'm going to do is draw out a range, and extend this range from roughly 318, let's just call it 32 000
so this will mark the upper portion of our range, all the way down to about 28 and a half thousand
okay? so if i extend this range to the right, and you could slightly readjust it, this shows us the range that bitcoin has been fluctuating in for a number of days
now, we could even look at this as representing a couple of weeks
now, why is this important? while this is important because this shows us the market structure for bitcoin, and how it's been, for the most part, gravitating towards each end, sort of like a magnet
so we have this the upper portion of the range, where this was a significant pivot point, and the lower portion acted as a significant pivot point
and so now we can make sense of what exactly had occurred over the last couple of days
where, going back to the hourly market structure, we had a rally during the end of may
so this is the rally where we were looking for bitcoin to break above the highs that we had during the middle of may, which it did
and we're anticipating the higher low and then the next consecutive higher high to play out
but typically whenever you do have these large, volatile movements, you're going to have deeper corrections, especially if you don't break out of ranges like in this case
we never technically broke out of this range, despite sweeping above these highs
and you can even look at this as representing a liquidity grab, right? so this was a temporary bull trap before we push down and gather up more liquidity
so this is where this imbalance from may 30th, or actually may 29th, this price imbalance was filled
so any orders that weren't efficiency efficiently placed at this point would have been placed again
and then we were sort of hovering around the midpoint of this range
now what's important is to note that after we started consolidating a bit, for a number of days, we rallied once again
so comparing these two rallies, we can see these large bullish candles come in where the price action once again approaches the upper portion of the range, which is at around 317 up to 32 000
but at this point there was more exhaustion from the bullish side
and then a couple of hours later, the same thing happen, but this time we formed a lower high
and ever since then, we've been pretty tight and range bound on the hourly market structure
so what exactly is the next move? well, if we think about this, the first thing that i'm noticing is the fact that similar, similarly priced lows are starting to form at around pretty close to 29 000
so you have to think about the the fact that, although these aren't exactly equal lows, these are within a very tight price range of about a hundred dollars or so
and so i'm sure a ton of traders probably have their stop losses set right below this region, anticipating that bitcoin is now forming its next consecutive higher low, right? so they're looking at this as, here's one low, here's, uh, maybe a slightly lower low, here's an equal low
but again, if we take a look at these bullish rallies that we've had, so the one that we had that stretched out during, uh, may 29th, compare this to the rally that we had on june 5th and june 6th, and then the one that we had on june 7th
and we can see that each rally isn't making as much progress, right? so that's combined with the fact that we have been consolidating so heavily, and we have these similarly priced lows
and you could even honestly take a look at the one hour at these lows as well
but you have more similarly priced lows that are appearing at around 298 000
so taking a look at this would mean that there's a greater probable likelihood that we are going to push down and sweep these lows
so now, just going back to the one hour really quickly, again, we can see how, although we are inside of a large daily range, on the hourly, this is a small hourly range, okay? and so this hourly range, until we successfully break out of it, which is less likely to occur, we are much more likely going to push down again
and we can even see how, inside of this small hourly range, we recently got a liquidity grab on june 8th, where this liquidity grab not only spiked above the highs uh earlier that day, but it also pushed into this small price and balance that was inside of this one hour bearish candle
so due to the fact that the liquidity here was cleared, this region was already mitigated
we already sweeped and cleared any regions of liquidity residing to the left, we had this major liquidity graph that occurred during the end of may
these coinciding factors again lead me to believe that we will break below this range
so that can occur sometime over the next day or so, where, although the price action might rally again to the midpoint, might even approach the upper portion of the range, what i would wait for is to see a break and retest below these lows that are at around 298 000
once that occurs, i'd be looking for the price action, short term wise, for the next two to three days at the very least, to push down to then try to challenge these lows around 292 000
and at that point, as we know, whenever you have similarly priced highs or lows, you're likely going to encounter a liquidity crap because these lows have been respected, for the most part, quite well since the start of june
so it's been about two weeks of this point of heavy, heavy consolidation
so a spike below here would grant even more liquidity, and you would still technically be respecting the market structure
so just because there's a good chance that we spike below these lows, understand that that doesn't necessarily mean that we will break out of this range
and even if that were to happen, right? so this is a shortterm target, again, below 292 thousand dollars
okay, so i know there's a couple of them, but this is how you can play your ons if you're shorting bitcoin, or if you're looking to enter probable long positions
at the very least, wait to see if these lows are sweeped at around 29 points two thousand dollars
and at that point, you could look for the price action to approach the bottom of this range
and the last scenario here is that if the price action at that point breaks below this range, then we could look for the price action to target these wicks, so the wick from may 26 6 and the wick from may 12th
and if anything, i'd be paying more attention to the wick on may 12th, because now if i drop down, let's actually go to the 15 minute chart
so now if we take a look at this wick from may 12 again, this is on a lower time frame, so it's gonna look a bit differently
but if we match up a volume profile to this rally from may 12, then we can see how we had low transaction volume occur around 266 000
so this is, of course, a very tight price range, but that's the next one that i personally would be targeting if we do end up breaking outside of this range
so let me just quickly go back to the one hour right around the midpoint of this wick, would be my next target
that might not happen, but at least for the foreseeable future
for the next upcoming days, i am leaning more towards the bearish side
and i understand that in the last update i was stating that if bitcoin were to rally to around 31 and a half or close to 32 000, there's a good chance it would hold up
so due to the fact that we did a rally, but then we rejected the upper portion of this range and the bearish momentum picked up again, and then we rallied again and formed a lower high, that changes my bias
so that's where you need to simply adapt to the market conditions
and that doesn't necessarily mean that we can't be bearish again in the month of june, but it does mean that we're much more likely to push down over the next few days
and then after that, perhaps for the middle or towards the end of june, we could then have a rally that pushes back up above 32 000
and if you'd like additional trading guidance, which includes indepth live streams that i have with members, additional guides, bonus weekly market update videos and much more, then check that out as well
so the current bitcoin price is thirty thousand four hundred and fifteen dollars
so especially some of the old queens, have moved quite nicely
i'm sure a lot of you are wondering, well, what does that mean? can we trust this? is it a fake pump? uh? is this the big move that we've been waiting for? well, i'll try and answer all of that today
so having a look over here at bitcoin on the four hour chart, you can see the series of lower highs
let's make another one, and we can move this one down to there
if price can get back above thirty one thousand six hundred dollars, then i would say, okay, maybe it's on
but interesting enough, when you have a look at some of the altcoins, they do seem to be moving nicely
and i did mention chaining, so let's take a look at the chain link chart
on this channeling chart, you can see it consolidated sideways and now just created another higher high
but at the end of the day, there should still be an opportunity
there will need to be some sort of a pullback to sit in the higher low
it's probably not going to come as low as here, so you can kind of just track along that trend line over here, this diagonal trendline, hopefully price, uh, will come down and move into that zone over there
but this is a bit of an anomaly in comparison to the rest of the market
at the end of the day, i still am more positioned towards looking for short term short trade, so shorting the entire market
for those of you who follow me on twitter, you would have seen i mentioned it there
again, that's why i encourage you have a look in the description below
uh, i did close the position this morning for an eight or nine percent profit
i'll show you the zoomed in picture, but having a look at a zoomed out scenario, this is what you have
you have this horizontal area which has now been violated, and price is coming back to the underside, testing that as a resistance
the only question for me is, how high will we get before price manages to totally turn around? so now you may be asking, well, if that was my yellow circle, the area where i said i was going to catch the wicks into, then, uh, what positioned me to decide to front run that and take the short? well, it was this
i'll zoom in on a 15minute chart, and this is what i'll often do on a 15minute chart
i have deleted the trend line, but i'll put it back in, and i'll show you my thinking
just a very, very simple trend line that had been governing these highs coming up into the resistance
i saw relative to that area that price was kind of weaning off over here
and as soon as we started to wick through here, i said, well, that trend line's been violated, and the chances are that it's probably going to come back down again
price came down, i drew my next trend line, and basically i got uh taken out of the position somewhere down here
and now i've just been tracking it since and seeing what it's doing from there
but the whole market does seem to be gaining a little bit of momentum
and just bear in mind that tomorrow there is going to be cpi, uh data results, inflation results
they're also going to come out with the jobs reports, the same story that we have every month
and you know, the lesson that i've learned is that every time we go into this the day before, so the market seems to move
even occasionally, on that cpi day, price will pump into the into the data results, and then the next day it gets faded
and if i'll go back to bitcoin, you can take a closer look at that
essentially what you want to see is you need to see the the previous highs taken out
so right now we kind of stuck back within this whole parallel channel over here
you need to bear in mind as well that the longer that you consolidate with price, it's, it kind of price contracts like that
and the the more gets squeezed, the bigger the breakouts or the breakdown when that comes
and i would anticipate that the chances are more than likely going to be that the cpi will be the catalyst for that breakout
so if you have a look over here, you've got your main trend that's just been governing price down ever since we got out of the market
for those of you who are following me, we sold everything out at around 47 k when we had this sort of fake out, and price came back down, made the next lower low, and it's been working ever since
if we can start to get back above this area and create higher highs, then we can target these next liquidity zones, which are coming in around 36 000 to 37 000
but for myself, personally, although i see an a possibility that we could break out and have some sort of a fake breakout to the upside, i would be more comfortable shorting anything that comes up within this region because, relative to the main trend, we are still going to be having just another low high relative to that area
some altcoins are popping, but i would definitely encourage you to to be cautious, uh, with any trades that you're taking
and the trend is your friend till the end, the trend of the overall market continues to be down
therefore, if you are looking to take leveraged trades, i think that it's better to be taking short trades, because that is the trend of the market is down
uh, tomorrow should be a much more exciting day, and we should have some sort of, uh, resolution to this whole trend
[Music], what's up the legends? hope you're having a fantastic thursday today
let's analyze the situation for bitcoin, see what's going on with the markets, see if we can get some good opportunities here
make sure to absolutely crush that like button on your win on your way in, guys, absolutely smash up the like button
i'm going to give you my opinion right now on what do i think could potentially happen with bitcoin
because yesterday we were talking about the immediate, short term
okay? these big, massive rejections, we did talk about, you know, that major opportunity that there was here
of course, that already happened, but very much detected here inside of this consolidation, respecting here this lower, high trend line, and also this major, big consolidation
and that big daily level, okay, we were talking about that daily level yesterday on the live stream, okay, where it was very, very much respected here, almost touching to the exact dollar, as you can see, and coming straight back down
let's just zoom in on the 30 minutes, all right, because i want to show you yesterday we were talking about, okay, on the 30minute chart, all right, that we did have this, you know, big drop over here, coming down all the way to the 618 levels
that was a good, good, major trade here on on bitcoin, where we did have that rejection from the daily from the trend line of the lower highs, you know, hitting that six one eight here really, really nicely, as you can see, consolidating here at this range, six one eight six five level from this major pump
and what is happening right now is, you know, yesterday we talked about this major dump, this major abc kind of correction, hitting the 618 also to perfection from this range
if i take fibonacci retracement from this high to the low, you know, we were hitting that 618 almost to the exact dollar, as you can see here on the chart
okay? we were just a couple of dollars away, but we did hit the, you know, almost a 618 level, all right, getting that rejection from the 50, uh, fibonacci retracement right over here
so we've got 50, 618, you know, having that kind of abc correction, looking for the lows here
now, what happened is that we did get a huge amount of buying pressure here, as you can see, with this major candle
so you can see that we did, you know, the ball step stepped in here
we didn't retest the exact lows, but it was, you know, we were going to that direction we were talking about, you know, it's very likely this low range to be retested
what i possibly see here after this range? because once you see this kind of price action, you want to see the price, you know, with this aggressive drop, okay? we've had the consolidation right there
you don't want to have it consolidating here for quite a long time
so what i do see here, potentially is that we are going to claim these highs because we've had this major um trying to break down
so, you know, the time right over here is, you know, is getting exhausted
we should see this abc kind of correction, a little consolidation, and then the price action moving to the downside pretty pretty fast
and there is a possibility that we are creating a gartly pattern here
why a garlic pattern? well, let me just show you here, with this consolidation, this low over here is round about the point 88, okay, 088, from this pump over here that we did have, as you can see, pump 88
and there is a possibility that we should be having a leg up, maybe to round about the 31 000 area, uh, maybe slightly above
this is because of this guardly pattern over here, from this high to the low to roundabout the one eight here of this pump that we just talked about, you know, creating this low here at the point 88, approximately, just slightly below
and then potentially we could see that garter pattern going above the 31 000 311, uh, maybe in the next coming hours
because if we do, uh, if we are going to consolidate for a longer range at this level then, um, yeah, this would be pretty much invalidated, because we want a onetoone extension
from this potential garlic pattern, that should take us to round about the 31, 311 ish, approximately
why the next coming hours? why the next coming hours? just want to show you here, whoever is unaware of gartley, of harmonic patterns, uh, gartly pattern right over here
so it should be bearish once we do hit, you know, that 311, 312, if we do get up there, this is usually a bearish pattern
so you could actually short that range if we were going to hit those levels, have a slight consolidation
numbers seem to be pretty accurate here, but we haven't got much time
if we do start consolidating around this range and dropping, okay, then this will be pretty much invalidated
but, uh, this would be the, this would be the the trade that i would be looking for, having that leg up, getting another rejection here from these lower highs
you know, if we do consolidate here at that 311, 312, um, it's going to be looking like a very good shorting opportunity
so, um, we've only got a few hours left for this actually, because it should happen in the next coming hours, uh, to have that leg up, all right
just because of the timing, this timing over here, you know, that leg up should happen in the next coming hours
uh, let me just show you here with fibonacci time, because this is extremely important
of course, there is time for everything, from this high over here to the um, to the high point here
you know, this is already a one to one so it, you know, this is a one to one extension from this level to this level
so we should be getting that leg up in a matter of, you know, hours maybe
if that's, if this doesn't happen in hours, then, yeah, this is very much going to, um, be invalidated if we start consolidating at this range
uh, then obviously this is very likely, probably going to roll down
but, you know, the balls have a chance right now, i think in the coming hours, we're going to have that leg up
because of fibonacci time, we have the onetoone extension from this range over here
um, you know, from this low this co we actually pumping at this moment, let's see, we're going to see that bullish price action all the way up here to round about that 31 000
there is a, there is a higher possibility, there is a high possibility in this happening, of course
and i actually did take a a risky long position at this level on by bit
this is not one of my favorite trades, because this is a a risk in one to gain 15, approximately
but yeah, i do see a potential leg up here in the coming hours
if we start consolidating here in the next coming hours, having a drop, having a pump, then, yeah, i will be exiting my position maybe, you know, and, you know, in a slight loss, or break even, uh, or or getting stopped out here, obviously, below the c point, which is where i have my stop loss
but the risk to reward here is not the best, okay? it's not the best because, um, you know, the best level here to get into along would have been all the way to up here
why would it be there? because once you create, you know, once you create this, um, once you create this leg up, okay? and come back down and have this consolidation
all right? to get into that trade, for that potential move to the upside, uh, because of this wick, basically, because of creating that higher low, because of this major wick, seeing this um buying pressure, and getting into the 618 here, looking for that liquidity grab above this, this range over here, hitting the point, seven, eight, which would be the the gartley target here
so, yeah, we're gonna take a look at some different scenarios, guys
this is something that i was looking at the short term, that potential possibility on on bitcoin, having that short term pump to then come back down
let's, uh, we're going to take a look at ethereum, also today, still in this like, kind of massive, aggressive descending triangle
okay? massive, massive selling pressure here, creating this big, solid base at the 1700 area
will it hold? will we get a, you know, massive relief rally, only if bitcoin does behave? we can take a look at s p 500, gold
we can take a look at natural gas, because natural gas i did exit my position on natural gas
i exited at a small loss on on on natural gas, because i did short this range
and of course, as soon as we claimed this range, i did close my short position
but, you know, i'm looking at natural gas right now, and this has given me very much a lot of confidence that natural gas is, is, is just poised to a very big, large correction at some point in the next coming weeks
all right? and maybe this is the start, because i do see this as a small distribution event
we have been trading in this range, you know, april and may, you know, just a couple of months right over here
and, you know, smart money makes this this kind of movement, you know, slightly breaking higher highs, then just to aggressively, you know, create a big, massive correction, because smart money and natural gas was buying all the way back here in january, february, all right, before you know what is happening, uh, you know, in the in the east side of europe
so what something on natural gas is very interesting here that, you know, we're having some pretty large volume
we can go to the four hourly here on natural gas, you know, we have this aggressive uptrend, and then what is happening right now is that we are in large volume selling at the highs
this is why i do think that this is a small distribution that can take the price of natural gas all the way down to around about the six dollars, or even the five dollars, even dipping below this range slightly
i would only reenter a position here on natural gas if we come back up
the ideal scenario natural gas, to give me confidence, would be losing these lows over here
but of course, there is a potential chance on natural gas retesting this trend line from these aggressive higher lows, at for for having that lower high, and then continuation to the downside
we had a pretty aggressive drop yesterday natural gas in between yesterday and today
so, yeah, there's potential, good opportunity on natural gas here
you know, this is indicating, you know, smart money is selling here
biggest volume that we have seen for the last, you know, four or five months on natural gas is happening right now, selling
we had a pretty aggressive drop on natural gas between yesterday and today, over a 15 drop
and i did short ride over here, but i exited here because, you know, we were seeing some pretty large, uh, momentum to the upside on natural gas
obviously, in the live stream, i do want to talk about, you know, what i see on the charts, give you my personal opinion
come on, guys, make sure to absolutely crush that like button right away, right away
i really do try my best to get some good content out there, some good technical analysis, some opportunities
we want to absolutely crush, okay, the charts and end the competition
let's see if we're going to be in the top 10, at least to be recognized
all right, for those big trades, for those big percentage gains
so i will be announcing soon once i am a leader in the competition
i do see this as a distribution, especially this volume, biggest volume from, you know, the last three, four months
you know, you're having the big volume coming in at the highs right now, all this push down
you know, this is, you know, this is the thing, you know, we might see the same thing, but you are going to make better gains than me
you know, it's just, i haven't been focusing too much on on natural gas, you know, focusing more on bitcoin, uh, because you cannot analyze 10 different markets because your head is just gonna explode
uh? but yeah, this is, i think it is, it is ready for a potential larger correction, claiming the lows here below the 650
and hang on one second, because i am bullish on natural gas, but i just think it is ready for that, for that correction
natural gas has gone, you know, for in in three or four months, it has pumped 150 it is ready for a little bit of a correction, a little bit of a cool off
natural gas consumption is slightly lower in the summer, okay, july, august
so it is just, it points out for a correction for the next coming months
you know, smart money is seriously, you know, not buying at these levels
you know, let's see, if, you know, maybe natural gas is going to also create that, that level for a lower high
because, you know, this trend line was broken, but came straight back up again
you know, there might be another chance, uh, you know, for for late june, to have that, you know, mid, mid june
i have been making some pretty nice gains on natural, uh, natural gas and also crude oil on primix bt
the good thing here, my goal on primexpt is my exchange to accumulate bitcoin, period
this is the exchange for my trading, to accumulate as much bitcoin as i can, because i use it as collateral
and i can, you know, trade different markets such as natural gas, gold s p 500
the good thing about this is that you get a seven percent bonus added to your deposit
guys, you need to definitely take a look advantage of this bonus if you are good at trading, if you are experienced
if you're not good on trading, stay away, because you will lose money very, very likely
okay, if you are experienced and know more or less what you're doing, definitely check it out
because you're using crypto as collateral, you can use stable coins, bitcoin or ethereum
and i am using bitcoin because i want to accumulate more as much bitcoin as i can
let's take a look at a few cryptocurrencies, see what's going on guys
how are you doing? joseph, glad you are here in the live stream
um, scotty, how are you? uh, it always goes to the wick, says, stephen joseph, hello
tracy says, don't worry, tracy, i will sort you out, no problem
i mean, if we do get this aggressive pump on, obviously, you know, my take profit area on this bitcoin trade is at the 31 000, 311 000 area because, you know, i, yeah, this is a level 2b to be bearish
you know, you we've got this 778 here from this gartly pattern, you know, right over here
and the reason why, you know, i was bearish yesterday, we were talking about this abc correction, you know, coming down to retest these lows
you know, this was a quick take profit area, once you have this wick over here, uh, yeah
this is telling me, you know, hey, this is not, this is very lightly not going to come lower
you want the the bears to absolutely fight this range and continue back down once you see this, this wick over here, this consolidation, you can see the balls gaining a little bit of steam here in the immediate short term
so, yeah, you there is a high possibility that you are going to claim this high in the next can we now hours to get that leg up? just looking at probabilities, looking at the harmonic pattern, fibonacci time
bearish exhaustion here with this wick, large consolidation with higher lows, you know, a little bit of a leg up here, and then potentially come back down
it would be nice to see a consolidation here at this 311, you know, 313, this area range, a little bit of volatility
it would be absolutely insane, because we do have a big spike on the vpvr at this level
you know, this spike at the vpvr, which is at 313, it starts here at around about 311
you know, it does make sense that the price of of bitcoin will get rejected at this level
if we do have that leg up? of course, you know, it would, it would be risky here, too long
it's just, i felt, you know, having a risky trade here, why not? but, yeah, this is not the place to, uh, to place a long position, of course, because this could absolutely fail
you know, we've only got a few hours here to get to the 31 000, 311, like i showed you with fibonacci time for this potential gartley pattern
ideal shorting scenario would be here, having a consolidation in between the 311 and the 313, approximately levels
if we do have that consolidation, you know, we do have a big spike here on the vpvr, big volume traded for the last, you know, 10 days in june here
if we do get above the 30 500 range in the next coming hours, i do just see us having a pretty large leg up because, you know, in june we haven't had much volume, uh, much volume traded in between 30 and 3311
if we do, i'll get a consolidation at this level, and then a big potential drop, only if we consolidate here, guys, only if we consolidate and see um and see a potential rejection at that level
anyway, you know, big, big gap here in volume from the volume trade of the last 10 days
you know, this is the moment, if if we are going to have a pump, it needs to be in the next coming hours
if it gets rejected from this range, i will potentially exit my short position, because that, that is the moment
we've only got hours left, looking at fibonacci time, like i explained, you for this cartly to have that leg up
if we get rejected couple of hours, then i will be very likely out of my position
you know, this is just a little bit of a risky trade, because i do see that that leg up to that 312
of course, this is not a good longing, long in trade, especially at these levels
you know, i i entered a slightly lower but, you know, if you want to, if you want to speculate for this garlic pattern, the best opportunity, you know, would be getting at these low levels for that potential long, because then you would have a tight stop loss
looking for that d point all the way up here, you know, that would, if you would have entered low, you know, the the risk to reward for this potential trade is a three, is a three or a four to one, you know
i entered a little bit too late, but i just felt, you know, i've had so such a good couple of weeks, you know, i i thought, you know, why not? why not? why not take the risk? you know, i'm feeling a bit risky because i've had a good couple of weeks of trading, and why not take the risk? it might be a good opportunity
but in this case, it's only a one to one point five risk to reward, approximately, maybe extending it to two
why not? the best opportunity here would be having that consolidation, if we were to have that leg up, guys, like i explained at the 311, 312, okay, looking for this guardly pattern that only has, you know, a few more hours left for that potential, you know, or that potential leg up if we start consolidating, having a little bit of a drop here, having a little bit of a pump then this would be, um, too overextended in time, in my opinion, and i would be looking for exiting my trade
this is a high, high risk trade, the one that i took, okay, but i felt risky
you know, when you have good couple of weeks of trading, you, you, uh, you do put your risk a little bit higher
i'm ro how are you doing? robert? pump it? yeah, i'm not sure
it is very likely, in my opinion, to get a pump here and then come down
steven um, hello, um, it's, i think it's a bulgarian name or russian name
i'm just reading people saying hello and, you know, different things
this is not, uh, if you're saying well done, i, i hope it's because of the content, because of the ta uh, sir, i am learning your video
okay? this is pure speculation, because a godly pattern is only valid, of course, once you reach, you know, the actual d range, which is the, we are, the point, 7879, having a little bit of that consolidation at this level
and then, you know, this is, this would be the absolute short opportunity, right? you are hitting a big spike on the vpvr
and only if you do see some wicks, only if you do see, okay, this is where where i would enter, okay, as a, as a conservative trader, only if i do see that consolidation at this range, at this d point, hitting the, you know, the value area low of this big mountain
uh, once i do see that consolidation at the 311, 313 is is where i would enter a trade
you could get that consolidation, get a couple of wicks would be the ideal
a couple of attempts, all right, of the balls, trying to break above this range and then enter a short
of course, you would be at least aiming for the value area high, which is this level over here, the 30 500
so you do have a, uh, you know, potential 6 700 drop, right? with a little bit of leverage, you could make some pretty huge gains
but, yeah, that's the, that would be the take profit one, the value area high from this range, if you take c point to d point, all depending on where you're ending, okay? it can be the 311, it can be the 312, you know, it all depends on where you could potentially reach if you are shorting this range
if you do get a consolidation, obviously, remember, because we talk about support and resistance levels on the channel where prices could consolidate and take a opportunity
but if the price doesn't stop there, you do not take the trade
this is why, you know, uh, you know, i can't stress this enough guys
but anyway, the sixth one, the 618 would be right at this level, hundred thirty thousand, five hundred, approximately
well, you do have the value area high from the volume traded, you know, the last ten days a year in june
so, um, yeah, it would be, you know, all points out with the levels, of course, you know, we, you know, if we start struggling to break this high, the value very high
you know, maybe we're not going to get that leg up because we have strong resistance also
if the bulls can't step in in the next couple of hours, then, you know, i would be exiting my long position, of course, and we won't see that, um, you know, that extension to the upside, uh? but, yeah, like i said, best, best high probability one, would be hitting that d point and having that consolidation
okay? so you would be getting, you would be getting your stop loss here behind x, entering right over here at this range
so risk to reward would be at least a two to one if you do enter there, looking for that thirty thousand, four hundred dollar range
what do you think of dia? not after a ta, but your general view based on what they do? quick project
um, it's, you know, i remember seeing a lot of people talking about it
i remember seeing it at around about two dollars, approximately
i will definitely have to do some more research, check out, you know, what they're doing, what their partnerships, what is their roadmap, you know, for late 2022, early 2023? i would definitely have to check, you know, if they are moving forward
for what i know, they are pretty legit, and they are moving forward
i'm very interested in an oracle solutions, of course, because they are very important for, you know, blockchain projects to cert to go forward, um, in the future
i mean, if you are bullish in this price, on this project, uh, it launched around about the dollar levels
i am interested in these oracle projects such as brand protocol or dia, just to do a little bit of of research on them, um, but yeah, if it's definitely accumulative levels
these are starting to be accumulated, accumulation levels, no doubt about that
you know, it's below the november that the 2020 lows, 2020 and 2021 lows
okay, if we this might have a large consolidation for the next coming months
uh, a massive, big, pumpy action, you know, in the next coming weeks
it is very, very likely going to consolidate below the one dollar level for it for quite some time
i think it's just gonna have boring side actual price action, and, and it's gonna be good for accumulation
zooming out on solana, we had a very large reaccumulation created in 2021 here, where we did have the drop
okay? we had the massive pump in april, uh, hitting the alltime highs back then
and then in may, of course, the big correction that happened for most of the crypto but solana then absolutely exploded
we had a large accumulation, reaccumulation zone here in the summer of 2021 for solana
and this is probably the area where we could potentially consolidate on solana for the next coming months
also, looking at the vpvr, is where we do have a large, big spike
okay, where we do have a big spike on the vpvr thanks to this accumulation
this is why, when we had this drop, we were looking, you know, for that potential bounce from this zone
of course, we have been creating some large volume at this moment
now, zooming in here on solana, you know, it is an aggressive descending triangle, something very, very similar to, to, uh, to ethereum, as you can see, creating this low, this low over here
can this be a double bottom? are we going to manage to break above this descending triangle, or are we going to break support? this is the thing, uh, very hard to say at this moment
all depending on the behavior of bitcoin ethereum, we might see solana having a little bit of, uh, you know, if bitcoin and ethereum pumps, then, of course, solana will have that pump
the ideal scenario here on solana would be getting above this last lower high, breaking out successfully here from this big, major resistance, lower high trend line
and then you could, you know, look for potentially a higher low here, for continuation to the upside thanks to this potential double bottom
so the selling pressure that we need to go with the trend selling brushes to the downside
so potential retest of the 35 dollars is possible if we solidly break the 35 range
if we go to the daily chart here, you know, we'd have to take a look at some daily levels
i mean, we could, i think we could drop aggressively with solana if we do lose the 35 range successfully
you know, we can come as low as the 20 22 area, which was the lows of the summer of 2021
because the price action in between 20 and 35 dollars was relatively fast
so it could get very, very bloody on salon if we lose the 35 dollars
we have, you know, pretty large leg down to the 20 range if we lose 35
i would focus on bitcoin and ethereum, mostly, take a look at the dxy
one second here, guys, because dxy is kind of struggling here
is it going to fail to break this range and create a lower high? i remember asking yesterday on the poll if the people were bearish on the dxy
like i said, for and for most of the cryptocurrencies, it's just going to have a massive, large consolidation, very likely in the next coming months
it doesn't work with blockchain okay, it has different technology, like constellation dag um
i think, you know, the lows from the summer of 2021 also could be a very, very strong base, which is the 20 cent level
we can actually dip slightly below this range, but it's a large consolidation
we do have, uh, very likely a big spike on the vpvr at these levels
looking at the volume traded, you know, from 2021, in 2022, we can see that, you know, you start to see big spike on the vpvr
of course, around this range there's more volume, of course, on the three cent level, four sun, four cent, but i don't think we're gonna go as low
if we do lose this low level, where we are consolidating at this range right now, we have a very, very aggressive, you know, descending triangle kind of scenario here
if phantom loses this range right now, at the 33 level, it is very, very likely going to come down to retest, or almost retest, the lows here, 2425 cents
you know, the probabilities in phantom, you know, coming down to retest the lows are that 24 25 cent level is very, very likely
and you will be looking for that 50 618 level, okay? from this aggressive drop, all depending on how far you you you drop, okay? if it's going to be 30 cents, 29 cents, i would be patiently waiting for that retracement back here to the biggest point of control level right there
and then i would be considering into entering a short position, you know, hitting the 50 percent, maybe a week to the 618
a couple of failed attempts at the largest spike here on the vpvr from the volume trader, between may and june, that would be the ideal scenario for continuation
look, entering that lower high okay, not entering a breakout because you could get that big, massive pump, uh, you know, to liquidate, of of course, very aggressive short positions
i would wait patiently for a little bit of confirmation here on phantom
remember, if you are an experienced trader, phantom is actually available here on um, but is available on on buybit
and also, you have the usdt perpetual to use a little bit of leverage
of course, if you are an experienced trader, you do have an insane bonus down below
remember, four thousand and fifty dollars can be claimed at the rewards hub
you need to follow the steps to claim up to four thousand and fifty dollars
also, you do not pay fees for 30 days, which is absolutely amazing
um, when good, when? when good dumps? when good dumps? i have no idea when good dumps
also, guys, i wanted to explain here, remember when when we talking about major levels and large consolidations, we need to, you know, we need to wait for the price reaction
we've been talking about this range, okay? one of my latest video was talking about, you know, this major level, okay, the 30, 500, 600 range
if we do have a consolidation on the one hourly chart, okay, then this is showing you price exhaustion
it is showing you, yet, that we could potentially take an opportunity
when you slice through like this, you know, there's no trade to be taken
like i said, you know, if we, if we, if the price of bitcoin was to pump all the way up to 311, 312, okay, and we do not get a consolidation, there is no trade to be taken here
price needs to see exhaustion to decide if you are going to take the trade
you know, this is the thing, a lot of people get highly emotional because or they are either risking too much, or they are fearful in missing the trade
okay? they get fearful, and they and they jump in a trade because they they probably want to miss it
you know, what could happen on bitcoin also, which i think is unlikely, with a whole bearish sentiment that there is, is, you know, getting an aggressive pump to the 41, 311, 312, and then you might get a big, massive pump, you know, to 32 000
would i would have shorted this range if this happens? no, i wouldn't
only if i, if we have that consolidation, all right, and have multiple attempts of the bulls trying to break this, this this range, this big, massive mountain on the vpvr, you know, these big consolidations
only if we consolidate and fail to break up, is when i will take the short
i do not, i you guys will notice, i, i always talk about probability, you know, very likely
you know, nobody knows at the end of the day talking about major levels
i think, you know, if we do go there, you know, there's a high probability in getting up there
if we consolidate at this range, you know, we might get exhausted and have that leg down
uh, must have been, you know, some confusion here of of about news or something
but it did have a pretty aggressive pump yesterday, as you can see on, oh, no, before yesterday, actually
they added it on, you know, the reason why i did see this is because they added it on, on by bit
you know, i was thinking, what is this crypto? uh, where is it now? why isn't it here? they did add a unified crypto yesterday on bybit, and it was up 100, uh, which was this unify, it's not there right now
this old coin has, you know, you know, 40 million market capitalization
just a few days ago, it must have been around about the 15, 20 million
this is an extreme low cap cryptocurrency price prediction for this
it just had a big, massive pump and dump for the last few days
they did add this on by bit, uh, just a few days ago, end of end of may, actually, 31st, 30th of may
so just less than two weeks ago, they did add it on by bit for some reason, and it got a huge pump
this is pretty curious when cryptos are added to buy bit, it or either pumps the first couple of days, because the amount of volume one by bit is is huge
of course, it's already in the billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars, uh? but the eyes, it either waits a few days and then has a massive pump, or it pumps straight on the launch
so, yeah, this is, i need to find out on these cryptos, because it, you know, it's worth a speculation
obviously, these are very unpredictable, but, yeah, if you have a good risk management, you know, why not put a little bit of leverage into a long position here? not too much, of course, of your capital, because this pumped over, i don't know what was it, two dollars to 40, over a thousand percent pump on by bit
but if they put unify on rybit on the 30th of may and it was trading flat, you know, this is a cryptocurrency that only has, you know, only had about 10, 20 million market capitalization
uh, why did they add it on, buy a bit, and after adding it on by bit, ten days after, you know, this seems like an inside job
you know, why not? why don't we add unify on, bibit, and then they have, you know, this inside job, as in, let's pump it aggressively and make some huge gains, get some really important news out
you know, you add a cryptocurrency, it's, uh, which is, you know, it is a microcup cryptocurrency
what is it? 600, 700, at least it had half 20 million market capitalization
cryptocurrency added on by a bit, 10 days after, it has a huge, massive pump
not even 10 days, eight days after, a huge, a thousand, over a thousand percent pump
be cautious with this, because there there was something fishy with waves also
you cannot go, alright, in february and pump, you know, 600, over 600 percent in less than a month
all right? just, yeah, around about a month, approximately, end of february, late march, 600, and then come straight back down
you know, there's something, something fishy going on, you know, over a 90 percent drop in and also, less than a month, approximately
we, if we, you know, smart money, i think, are buying at these levels
you know, there is hundreds of millions, you know, coming in on on waves at the four dollar range, because it's a 700 million market capitalization project at this moment, and it was only about 300, uh, you know, about two weeks ago
so this is why, you know, of course, you've had a few hundred million poured into the waves, uh, crypto project
you know, this can be the start of some bullish price action to the upside
and we were analyzing waves yesterday on yesterday's live stream, and i just wanted to show you here that it is very, very likely, you know, your comps, you got some pretty nice, aggressive, uh, volume to the upside
you know, it's very likely going to have a consolidation at this range and have an attempt to retest the highs here at the 1050 level
okay? very, very likely this is going to be retested after this consolidation
what we do not know, if, you that we if we can maybe have that another leg down on waves
you know, most of the cryptos were kind of bearish here in march, you know, in april of of this year, we had, um, you know, a huge, massive pump on waves
and waves had a really nice pump, of course, just, uh, at the end of may, having a little bit of its own kind of life
so, um, yeah, you don't have to, um, pay too much attention on bitcoin in the case of waves, because it has moved differently
but i would, you know, i'm eyeing this consolidation at this level around about the six dollar, yes, in between six, six, 680, approximately
we're already hitting 50 fibonacci, where we are getting this consolidation right there
as you can see, if we come down to the 61865 and consolidate with extreme low volume, even better
we could pump from this level to retest the 1050, or we could either put dump a little bit more
i would be more focused on that volume is going low and low and low
and i think they're going to step in and retest these this 1050 level, it's very likely to happen
looking for that leg up on on waves to that 10 area in the next coming days, potentially
guys, i will do another, uh, take a shot for every time andy says waves
what you think about our btc hitting the 200 week moving average? let's take a look
because you are new to the channel, you will notice that i never use moving averages, but we can take a look
and i think this would be the the bearish case, right? the 200 weekly moving average, which would be all the way down here
i mean, this is the thing i've, i've seen people talking about the 200 weekly moving average
and that would, you know, that would, that would indicate the bear market low area, right? that would be a massive, good buying opportunity, the 200 weekly moving average
i do think that this bear market still has, you know, 6 12, 18 months, uh, very, very likely
so the, you know, coming down to retest this level, i think it is very, very possible
i think we could hit, you know, right at this moment, it would be around about the 22 000 range
we can see how it was the bear market low, okay, back in the last cycle
so can we come down and retest it? we also came down in and the c19 crash
can we come down and retest this level? absolutely totally possible
can we see some relief pumps? yes, obviously we do see relief pumps in bear markets
but coming down to that range in between the next six, 18 months is absolutely very, very possible
i do think in the next coming hours we could have that leg up
only to be bearish, though, only to be bearish, claim this high above 30 800 and consolidate in between 311, 312, uh, 313, round about that range
and then potentially, if we do consolidate, and we're doing today and tomorrow, if we do get up there, of course, nothing is guaranteed
i do think with fibonacci time and this garlic pattern with this wick, also this major wick that we did see with the balls, you know, stepping in, i think it's very, very possible that we do get that leg up, only to have another leg down if we consolidate

andy says abida, thank you amro, guys, thank you for joining the live stream
i really, really are pumped up to make these live streams because i really like to interact with the community
hopefully i can do a live stream afterwards, or a daily update on bitcoin and maybe some other altcoin
i will be asking, what cryptocurrency do you want me to analyze properly? um, you know, full focus analysis
how are you? i'm just gonna give it to the family, to the community first of all this morning
it was that one that you wanted me to look at yesterday, right? uh, ali, stef taya, espasos and sitios
it's a little bit, no, it's we have the wind is blowing in sweden this morning
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, and then we can go into the charts
i i haven't changed my stoploss or take profit yet, because i want to go into the to the charts and see what's happening
i know i've already said it, but i've actually been in indonesia
i don't remember exactly where we were, um, but we went to this place where you can pay to see dolphins in the wild, because me and my ex at that time, um, we didn't want to go to where they locked up them, so we were just going on a boat
indonesia is such a beautiful and especially when you come from a country as sweden, because we don't have that type of nature in sweden
and i know for sure that you would be like, oh, wow, a nice, uh forest that swedish have
but indonesia, like all of the countries, obviously that if that is exotics, is very beautiful
it's like such a different, uh, it's so different when it comes to the weather, the nature, everything
uh, not only i entered the short on bitcoin with you, but want to know your thoughts going forward in shape
how are you? how's the um, how's the trade going? raj edgardo, yes, we can go into ee ve soon, but we're going up
so i definitely believe, uh, i definitely, i definitely believe that we can, if this day also, will be very calm
and tomorrow, maybe not at this time, but i definitely believe the market will start to be very volatile soon
so the market is right now just, you know, trying our patients, and then from nowhere, you see the market spike
and when it comes to gaps, the market is usually, um, filling the gaps too
this is something, for example, when we look at us 30 or spx 500, you usually don't see the gaps on treating you
and the gaps, if you don't know what a gap is, it's the distance between, you can see between this candlestick right here that we did have, uh, tomorrow yesterday at 20, uh, 10 o'clock, and to the next candlestick
uh, so the opening between these candles, you had a gap and the mark, and you also had had it here
and when you look at, for example, as i wanted to say, at us 30 or spx 500, when you're looking, when you look at certain brokers, because you cannot see the gaps on trading, you especially not what i can see
so you you know, if use 30 opened or closed with a gap, the market will run away in some uh, yeah, pretty fast, fill that gap
so if you see that the market is pulling back up, you see the market close here
the market opens with a gap, the market will come back down ins uh, and fill the gap
so i just want you to know that while we're talking about it's always good to have have in mind
but when i was looking at, uh, i looked at the xy yesterday, and i did use a trend line
i took a fibonacci a fibonacci um from, let's see, i took a fibonacci from 101854
and we dragged it up to hundred and two point seven hundred, uh
so you just might see the market now break this level, created as a high loan that could take us, uh, to higher target
so we just might not even respect this, uh, low that i i spoke about, because this is where i, i was thinking, oh, and we can
it can obviously still happen, because we're right now retesting this level
so if we start to see on the lower time frames, and you can already see that we do have some lower highs now, but this is a high
so we're just gonna have to wait and see if, if we will have the push, or if we will see the market, um, break this level and start to see some movements to the downside
if that is the case on bitcoin and all of the other pairs, that it's against usd i will go to the opposite direction
i took it on this candlestick that we did have around 40, uh, two o'clock yesterday
and just let's see what's, what's gonna happen on the lower time frames
um, so i, i don't actually know these, when when you start to see three candlesticks like this, it's, i know, to the opposite is the three black crows, but it's something else
because when you have the three black rose, it's a bullish reversal pattern, and then you see the market go up
so when we got these three um candlesticks like this, this is, this is a reversal pattern
but we'll see if this is a level somewhere the market is now retesting
hello, sleeping golden how are you? okay, i'm gonna take this one
so based on that, we're using the previous resistance that we did close below yesterday, uh, we did close below 30 515
three white uh, dear pattern is a threeway, the three, it's a bull, okay? it's a bullish that is used to predict the reverse of the current downtrend
well, how to trade the three prize reverse following in a downtrend? learn more about this candlestick pattern
but what i've learned is that when we see these three candlesticks, and i've seen them so many times, that from after it, you see the break
so when we when we use the, uh, fibonacci now, from the, from the push that we did have from 30 730 back down to this, to the support at 30 052
um, we, we can see, this is the levels where we could see the market, um, if we haven't already retested it
but it does look like we can have, uh, okay, maybe we just retested the 50
we're gonna do like this, because, okay, so we came up to the 50
i connect the dots with the low, with the higher low, with the higher low
and we're about to break this level right now, but we haven't officially broken until we break this, uh, higher low at thirty thousand two hundred and twenty six
so this is on the lower time frames, but we do have, on the one hourly a very, uh, big week right here
so we, i def i definitely believe that we will pull back up a little bit more
can you see how ugly this chart is? on the three hourly charts? it's not, it's not beautiful
can you just see how it looks like? what is this? what it or what are we even looking at? i mean, we can obviously see, but this is crazy
you see this huge wick right here? that's what i talk about when it comes to this week
but, well, i strongly believe, as i strongly believe, that we can pull back up to thirty thousand, uh, 390, potentially also thirty thousand four hundred and seventy so don't be surprised if you see some movements
um, if we break the level at as i told you, thirty thousand two hundred and twenty six, this could be where you start to see the market actually break down
so that is why it's really good, uh, using, uh, both the the break of structure, when if we would see the market have the momentum now to the downside, but we also understand if we see the push, because we just might need to fill this week, come back up, retest one more time, and then see the market potentially break down
um, but if we from nowhere, would see a bigger movement to the upside, because that could obviously happen
um, if we break above, uh, thirty thousand hundred 586, that could be where we start to see the push
because remember, we are in a sideways market, so we can definitely have another push back up here, and, you know, see whatever the market's supposed to do
but, uh, beauty always comes from the inside of our heart, isn't it? lauren, oh, i can agree with that
what? you want me to break dance? you want me to make a fool out of myself? what are you talking about? okay, let's see what else
if you haven't already liked the live stream, it's 41 people that liked it
so please support me by liking the video so we can reach out to more people
so if you didn't look at the video that i did have yesterday, um, alerts
okay, so this, uh, candlestick was where, um, the exact movements when i sold bitcoin a couple one hour ago
we came back up and retested a 50, the same 15, 60 percent again
um, going to the lower time frames, you can see that this candlestick, or these two candlestick, close below the first lower high
so we're using, or i use this high alone as the la as where i connect the dots, because this is the higher law
if we break it, you can already see how the market is now retesting this higher low
but if we close below this level, uh, we're, we will create a lower low
market can come up and create a lower high, because that that is what we're looking at and looking for
so either we will have it a little bit, uh, higher up, or you will only see the break of the the support, retest against it, and then see the drop
uh, my morning has brightened for the second morning in a row
uh? natalie, if b2c touches 30 536, would you come out of this trade? i need to look at it
i'm not sure what, what? why is it not giving me anything? 30 000? ah, it was right here
if we're breaking above 30 000, why didn't it come up here? maybe a subset wasn't here to see that
so if we're closing above 30 536, um, everything depends on how the market is looking
i mean, you can still have the market being a little bit volatile and come up and retest these levels
i just wanna, i the most important thing is to see, do we try, do we say, fake out, retest against this level again? so i would just wait and see how the market's gonna behave around it
can we believe a blonde woman? i don't know that's your that's your decision
so i think this was something we spoke about, this one yesterday
i think i mentioned, um, that we wanted to see the break of this level right here
so one thing that we can do, i just can see it with my own eyes right now, if we drag a, because we are inside the higher time frames fibonacci at the moment, if we look at the higher time frames
even if they works, and even if they work in the same way, i'm gonna do it like this
so i dragged the fibonacci from zero point eight thousand nine hundred and ninety five back down to the low at zero point four thousand six hundred and fifty six
and the the fibonacci levels ends at zero points six thousand eight hundred and fifty and, uh, zero point seven thousand three hundred and fifty seven, go down to the lower time frames
but what i also did, i think it was on the 12 hourly chart, i took the fibonacci from zero point seven thousand eight hundred and thirty and this is exactly where i right now
so we are in between zero point six thousand six hundred and thirty three and zero point six thousand two hundred and sixty
and this is where we do expect the market to slowly instead, it starts to reverse back down
but based on that, the 15 61 levels is, the distance between them is pretty far
so that is why we see the market consolidate in between these levels
so the market is always using, most of the time on the higher time frames, the market is usually using the 50 and 60 percent as support and resistance
in this case, we expect the market to break to the downside, right? and you can already start to see that on the one hourly chart
can you see how the market created higher highs and higher lows until we came up to the 618 percent
so this is could actually be where you see the market drop back down
so another thing, and and i actually like it, because i usually do it on the lower time frames, you see the breakup structure
and we could actually have taking, or i could have taken a trade here
so you can see how we drag fibonacci from 0660 to the break of structure, to six thousand three hundred and nineties
uh, ninety seven, can you? and market came back up, retested fibonacci levels per perfectly
so what we're gonna do now, on the one hourly chart, we're gonna take a fibonacci from zero point six thousand five hundred and thirty nine or forty, back down to zero point six thousand and three hundred
so now we go down to the lower time frames, and the same thing right here
so this, if you, if you've been on my, my previous live streams, where would you have the back testing? this is what the market is doing all the time
so now we're inside another fibonacci, and we are retesting from this lower high to this lower low
but this is where you can see the market um break down, first of all
so this is what i expect, at least as it from a bullish perspective
if we start to see a bigger momentum, we can, obviously, um, we can drag, if we would see ada have a bigger momentum to the upside
we're just going to change the fibonacci from up to the first level that i did have
um, if we have a bigger push, it's pretty far away, but it's always good to have in mind that you can come up to these levels
but everything depends, right? that's why it's really important for us to understand the levels
oh, edgardo, aave aav e usdt, thank you so much, lauren for helping me out
can you see how close it was? we almost came back up and retested the level at 103
but i remember, i don't when was it? when was it? good morning to you in europe
jc, yeah, so what i think what i did was that i took a feed from 111 back down to the support at 971
we expected the market to pull back up to these levels, but never had the power to do that
that this is why it's so important that we're playing around with the fibonacci, because sometimes the market doesn't reach the level, so you're looking at the break instead of this structure
so when we start to see on the lower time frames, for example, in this case, we expected the market to pull back up to 104 and go down to the lower time frame
so we saw that the market started started to have some trouble breaking this level or continue to the upside um
so what we could have done, or something that i would do, is i would play around
okay, i'm using the fibonacci against this high first, because that's how we connect the dots, where when you start to see the market having some trouble, continue to the upside
we had a perfect entry by just following what the market did, instead of being um, instead of just waiting for the market to reach the level
market consolidate inside the fibonacci, 618 percent and the 50
market broke structure, came back down, retested the support trendline, also confirming that with another fibonacci, market goes down and take profit
almost got hit on this trade since yesterday i didn't call it out
can you help me to grow up my brain? crypto pizza? no, that's your job
even if you have in control of it, it will control this out of you
so what we can do is that we drag another fibonacci from this high at 1002, back down to 91961
can you see how perfectly the 50 now, 618 percent is combined with my box at 986 dollars, and the fifty percent is at nine to eight point one dollars
this just might also happen right now, if we drag fibonacci from nine to seven port
and that could be the drop fibonacci from the high to that lower low will give us other levels to see if the market is actually breaking to the downside
we can come up and retest 290 or 291 dollars, and from that level we can see that beginning to the downside
because we came up and retested the other fibonacci on the higher time frames, and the little fibonacci that i have on the lower time frames is only, um, the pullback of [Music]
but, uh, when we can also only come back up and reset the 50 at 289
uh, guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
you could help me grow the channel by liking the live stream so we can reach out to more people
okay, so we can go to, uh, i want to go and just see how us 30 is looking
i think like most of the people don't like other people, but we actually do
had a huge week that took, i most okay, so we if we would have, i never saw the market on nasa yesterday
what? 12 720 was the reverse, and the stop loss should have been above this high
i saw someone cody used to t i know we were looking at this one yesterday
i know a lot of you were, i hopefully a lot of you were on my live stream, uh, last night
oh, finally something, something different to look at, even if the the setup looks the same
um, on kodi, on the higher time frames, we have a trend line, and we saw the market give us one, two, inverted hammer, so 100
so we could see a pullback up to potentially zero point eight thousand six hundred and eleven and zero point one 01756
so that is the weekly but remember that we're right now also coming, uh, we're about to retest this previous, uh, resistance trend line that on the highest time frames
um, so you can definitely see the market only try to retest this level and then see the drop
but that's when we're using the beautiful support trend line, because the supported trend line will always help us
it looks like we start to have some trouble continuing to the upside, and that just might be because we're coming up to the to the trend line
so what we're going to do is that we're also going to use this little high
so if we start to see the market break below, potentially, 01 400, and also break the support trend line, and if we come back up, potentially and retest, okay, 1 400, that could be the beginning of the drop
so in this case, i don't use a fibonacci, but that is only because i start to see the resistance trend line, um
so, and we start to see the market have some trouble breaking the previous high, i'm gonna do this instead
if we close below that level and you see retest, that could be the beginning to the downside, to the downside
okay? but otherwise, if we break the level, we can come up to 01 606 or 1756
can you see why did i talk about this level? because if we go back in time, we are retesting this previous and this was exactly what i talked about
can you? so i was talking about this previous high, and this is where the le where
you always know, i'm sorry if remember when i say when the market is trying to break a level, we need to see the other candlesticks and see how they're actually looking against the level
and this doji, for me, is not a breakout and retest doji, because the breakout candle is so close to the resistance that we try to break
and on the lower time frames, you can you see that we also did close below this high, this candlestick high, we did close below it
and now you can see on the lower time frame, so that is on the four hourly, this is the fake out retest
and the high i i was talking about, that we just might see the market pull back up to the higher time frames, fibonacci around 936 or at 1007
and so what i did on the lower time frames was that i also took a fib from 750 to the high at 874 dollars, to see if we come back down
it's so many numbers now, sorry, if we come back down and reach us 79 to 8
and that could be the push to the fibonacci levels, and then see the market drop
um, but remember that on all of the other pairs, the market is about to go down, right? it looks like it, at least
and now on the lower time frames, it kind of looked more sense when you see the market now start to retest these levels and break to the downside
um, so this could be where the lower height is about to be created
but we can still see if the market comes back down to retest the support trend line for another push
but when we break it, that's when i start to look for sell opportunities
um or, did i miss anything? avox or lexi gala is my fav waves, please
near usdt, all the birds is here, like, so we, i have this very beautiful birds outside, not but you can hear, you can hear them like, so beautifully
and then from nowhere we have the seagulls that destroys everything
can you please explain to me how you do it? i don't like the way the market is looking
i'm just going to give you levels to where if we break one level
so you'll either see if we break, uh, four point nine hundred and eighty two, we can pull back down to four point three hundred and thirty
if we see the market push back up, we can come back up to the resistance around five point nine hundred, or 60 dollars
okay, we can be taking up to this previous uh, if we go back in time at six point four hundred and twenty six
i just don't even if the market looks the same when it comes to bitcoin, but you can see the structure a little bit differently
i think alice was after this one near cody, but we did look at cody
but if you haven't already to subscribe to it, go inside and do that so you know when i am live next time

you can obviously still use by bit um or already do that, but you can receive a bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars
well, we were so when we looked at alice the last time, we actually came back up and retested this fibonacci at 78 183
and this is why you should follow my page, because even though i'm no financial advisor, these trades are really good
and the take profit won on this, people not, ah, every take, probably one, two, three, got hit
well, it's the mindset you need, right? i must say, she's really good
someone tried to have, have some fun with the names like mike, i know
and based on this fibonacci that we're taking from three point eight hundred back down to the low at two point one hundred and ninety, based on this fibonacci, where we we had take profit one exactly at the low of the monthly low
so i definitely believe that we can have a push back down to this
and whatever happens after, i cannot care about that right now, because it's too far away
so we try not to cut any candles, but right now it's pretty hard not to
i'm gonna do it something like it can actually, sorry for yelling
what is this? rude little boy? we're taking fibonacci from 2917 back down to 2790
we can come back up and retest two point eight hundred and fifty three, potentially two point eight hundred and sixty eight, also, um
and that is also the retest of the support trend line that we did break
if this the lower targets, if this is the case, uh, take profit one
take profit one is seven hundred and sixty take profit three is, uh, two point six hundred and ninety two
and take profit three is two point six hundred and thirty four
okay, just gonna see how it looks on bitcoin one last time before i go, what's happening? okay, so we broke the support trendline
i'm still gonna wait for the market to i'm not gonna change anything, because i definitely believe that we will soon have a, a, um, some movements
so if we're scared about our stoploss getting taken, then you are at the wrong place to be in
because that is always a, that is always a risk that will we are willing to take
so when you choose to either sell or buy the market, you you are willing to lose that type of money
so for me to freak out just because my stoploss could be taken, i mean, then i should not trade them
i should not be a trader then, right? thank you so much guys for looking at this live stream together with me
if you haven't already liked it, please go inside and do that

we always show respect, which we share our, uh, we share our knowledge, and don't fight with each other, because that's not what this, this commun this community is about
because if you fight with each other based on the charts, stop doing that, because the chart doesn't give anything about you

my name is Josh, and in less than 24 hours, a Brand's new CPI data, also known as inflation data, will be released
and it is very likely that could cause more volatility in the market
and also, the ethereum short positions are almost at all time low levels
meanwhile, the amount of people shorting ethereum is pretty much at an alltime high level
this will be important to pay attention to later in this video
just starting off the video with a quick explanation about all of this inflation data
and basically, in less than 24 hours, the inflation data, also known as the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, will be released for May
and as for when the CPI data will be released, that will be at 12 30 PM GMT time on Friday the 10th of June, so in less than 24 hours
and looking at last month, inflation came in at around 83 percent for the US
based on the CPI data, and based on the trading economics forecast and consensus, they are both predicting another 83 annual inflation rate after the new CPR data gets released
dollar is expected to stay the same with this new CPI data, according to consensus and the trading economics forecast
but keep in mind, even though these four Cuts have been pretty accurate in the past, they can still be wrong, obviously
in fact, the last two times they were slightly wrong, but only by around 21 or 02 percent from what we actually saw
so you might be wondering, what does all of this mean for the market? and basically, if inflation comes in above 83, above what we're expecting, then that is not a good thing, because it means the FED might get much stricter with tightening their monetary policy, which is not good for markets if we see higher interest rate hikes and all of that sort of stuff
but on the flip side, if inflation comes in below 83 percent, which would show a decrease in inflation since last month, and therefore creates a downtrend in inflation since March, obviously that would be a very good thing to see, because if that's the case, then it means the FED is already on the right track with what they're doing at the moment, basically 50 basis points hikes
and based on expectations the majority of the market has already pressed in 50 basis point hikes
but if inflation gets worse, worse than we expected, then it is possible we could see something like a 75 basis point hike
and if that happens, we could see a further crash in the markets
but if inflation comes in as expected, at around 83, or ideally lower than 83 percent, then it's very likely that the FED will continue to their 50 basis point hikes as planned, which has basically already been pressed into the markets
so to put it simply, if inflation comes in well above 83 percent, then it's likely we could see a dump tomorrow
if it comes in well below 83 percent, we could see a decent pump in the markets tomorrow
but otherwise, if it remains at 83, as pretty much the majority is expecting, then we shouldn't see too much volatility tomorrow, necessarily
but keep in mind, just next week we have another fed meeting, where we could experience more volatility around that event, as we usually do
and also, what I usually do is as soon as these numbers come out, literally within minutes of these being released, I tweet them over on my Twitter so if you want to stay up to date in real time, make sure you follow me over on my Twitter
and the link to my Twitter is in the description down below, and also in the pinned comment
this right here is the daily Bitcoin chart, looking at the Bollinger Bands
they're still in that squeeze formation, which basically tells us the Bitcoin price is coiling up, ready for potentially another volatile move coming sometime soon
and in fact, this is lining up pretty well with the events that we have coming up within the next one week, the CPI data release and also the next fed meeting
and the last time we saw a squeeze like this in the Bollinger bins on The Daily Bitcoin chart was back here, just before a very volatile move to the downside
but of course, just because we had a bearish, volatile move the last time we saw a squeeze in the Bollinger Bands, it doesn't guarantee we're going to see another bearish move
it could very well be a bullish move if we get good news out of the CPI data and also out of next week's fed meeting
and just giving you a quick update on the shortterm bitcoin price action here on the four hour time frame
and nothing much has happened over the past one day, so I'll keep this very quick
basically, we still have some shortterm resistance at around 30 700, and short some support at around 29 and a half thousand
and other than that, I'm looking at this descending line of resistance coming into play at around 313 K, approximately
and as for more significant levels to watch on the chart for resistance, I'll be looking at around thirty two and a half thousands as our significant level of resistance
and our significant level of support is coming in at around 28 and a half thousand
and basically, if we break one of those levels, that's when we could experience another extremely volatile move in the Bitcoin price
and something very similar can be said about ethereum, because this right here is the daily ethereum chance, looking at the Bolling bands indicator
and right now we are in a squeeze formation, but this one isn't as significant as what we saw back here on the ethereum chart
but this indicator is still squeezing nonetheless, which means ethereum is technically still coiling up for another volatile move
and it would likely follow along with what Bitcoin is doing as well
so for example, if Bitcoin plays out an extremely bullish move, it's likely ethereum will do something similar
if Bitcoin plays out a bearish move, it's likely we'll see something similar for ethereum against the US
and just jumping into the shorter term ethereum price action here on the 6L charts, obviously we still have this symmetrical triangle pattern in its formation phase, with this line of support coming into play at around 1740 to 1750, and this line of resistance coming into play at around 1900
and we still have a very important level of support for ethereum at around 1700 per ethereum
taking a look at the ethereum short positions on the biffinx exchange right now, they're basically at all time low levels
and the last time that happens was at the end of 2019, entering into early 2020, as the price of ethereum was basically bottoming out
and in recent videos here on the channel, I've gone further into detail about this, charts right here in the ethereum short positions on the biffinx exchange
but basically, this is the amount of ethereum sitting in short positions on that exchange, which is also like saying, this is the amount of money, or the amount of value in terms of ethereum, in these short positions
and there's a very good chance that a lot of these ethereum short positions did belong to Wales, also known as smart money, considering the fact that bitflex isn't exactly a popular exchange among retail investors, considering it's an OG crypto Exchange change, so it's gathered its users over the past 10 or so years
and obviously, the people who have been in crypto for 10 years likely have a lot of money, and are probably whales of some sort, or smart money
and on top of that, if you're looking at bitfinex as a derivative exchange, it's number 27 on the list on coin market cap, which means it is not as popular as some of these other exchanges, such as buy bits, for example, is currently in the top five exchanges in 24 hour volume traded
and it was only launched in 2018, which is relatively new compared to some other exchanges
and so when you consider this public information that we have in front of us, there's a very good chance that a lot of these ethereum short positions over on biffinx belonged to ethereum Wales rather than relatively new retail Traders
but on the flip side, taking a look at the short positions on the buy bits exchange, and this isn't the amount of value in short positions, this is the percentage of ethereum short positions on the buy bit exchange, which basically tells us the amount of people, or the amount of accounts on buy bits, shorting ethereum, relative to the amount of accounts longing ethereum
and so while we're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars flow out of ethereum shot positions on other exchanges like bitfinex, at the same time, we're seeing a lot of people enter into new short positions on the Bible to exchange, one of the more popular exchange for especially newer Traders
so basically what this means is you have a herd of people running into new ethereum shot positions, while the big money is leaving ethereum Short positions
and technically speaking, based on how the price action has interacted with these short positions in the past, this is more of a bullish thing for ethereum than a bearish one
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum versus Bitcoin chart here on the daily time frame
and we have now confirmed this bullish Divergence here on the daily charts after we had a previous bullish Divergence that was active for about a day or two and then invalidated
and technically speaking, this bullish Divergence does mean that we're due to see reduced bearish momentum for ethereum versus Bitcoin
but keep in mind, as I just said, we we did have another bullish Divergence just a few days ago that was invalidated pretty quickly, which shows we're still in a relatively strong downtrend
so this might not necessarily last very long, but at least in the shorter term, talking about the next few days, potentially, this is a good sign for ethereum versus Bitcoin
meanwhile, the Bitcoin dominance here, on the weekly time frame, is actually running into a decent amount of resistance
so it would be interesting to see if the Bitcoin dominance plays out a rejection or a breakout from this area of resistance
but as of right now, it's too early to tell whether we're going to get a major rejection or a breakout Above This range of resistance
in particular, we're just coming in at around 47 to 49 Bitcoin dominance
but either way, if you click one of these videos popping up right here on your screen, you can find out how you can make more money in crypto, even when prices are going down
but anyway, that is everything that they have to say for today
so the current price of bitcoin is thirty thousand four hundred and forty six dollars
the only good thing that i can say about that is that means that we can lower our invalidation level
so if you do want to turn bullish, that level can be moved down
and before this would have been the main area that you would have needed to clear
that area can now be moved down to this before even considering getting bullish on bitcoin
and that area comes in between thirty one thousand three hundred and thirty one thousand six hundred dollars
so as long as the bitcoin price is anywhere below that horizontal area here, that is going to be just another lower high
we can see that price came all the way down after yesterday show towards where my little lines are that i drew
but it didn't manage to break below the key horizontal instead, it bounced off of that and this is why you guys have to follow me on twitter
if you were, you would know that i mentioned that, uh, funding rates went extremely negative
as well as price, or bitcoin price at least, is in backwardation as well
and that's essentially the difference between the spot markets and the futures markets
and when you remain in backwardation for a long period of time, price will typically tend to reverse
so we had that movers now played out, and now we're back to the drawing board, so back within the range
and i'm looking at two particular altcoins, in essence, with bitcoin, i am expecting for the same scenario to still play out with these lines that i had over here
so, i mean, i could pretty much just move them up, like, let's just grab that one there as well, literally just move up those lines
i would just say that maybe the timing is a little bit wrong, but essentially this is still what i'm waiting for
so in the newsletter today, you're going to see, i put out this chart over here
it is actually one of my favorite coins, fundamentally, and it's chain link
and what i was watching here is, i had a look and i said, well, chain link is notorious, is one of those coins that, uh, defies all others
in bull markets, it doesn't perform as well as the other coins
but is this testament that we are in a prolonged bear market? well maybe
and the reason why is because it seems to be forming an uptrend
so we had the yellow lines over here, which is your range, high, range, low
we broke out of that range, so creating a first higher high, higher low
you have the yellow area over here, which i said, if you really were brave and you're looking to take along in this market, that would be the zone that i'm looking at
and to give you the exact price points, i would be longing anywhere between and 765 cents and eight dollars and 17
if it manages to set a higher low over here, then at the end of the day
let's have a look quickly at what this shows us over here with in terms of the momentum oscillators as well as the emas
so you can see that the uh ema's are starting to turn back up
price managed to get above the 200 ema, which is typically a good sign
if you can manage to get the purple to cross above the blue, which is the 50 above the 200 ema, i would call that a golden cross, and that would be my signal to, uh, go long
i would, i would say that probably that thesis is correct with changing
if i do end up taking along on this, i'll post it on my twitter and i'll make sure to keep you all up to date next uh, yesterday i mentioned bnb, and we looked at it on a much higher time frame
and i said to you that it could potentially have a lot of downsides still ahead
i said that, yes, it showed relative strength in comparison to the rest of the market, in the sense that, uh, it's only come down 60 percent, whereas the rest of the altcoins are 80 to 90 percent down already
so when when i zoomed in and i had a look at it today, i saw the opportunity for potential shorts
and you have the lower highs coming down on the fourhour chart, signaling distribution
you have a new swing low, which is marked with this arrow over here
so these areas over here, you're holding, holding, holding, holding on a horizontal and then you lost that, creating a new swing low that will now become underside resistance
and any wicks that may pop through into that yellow circle, i'll zoom in and make that big again
this is all in the newsletter for those of you that want the exact prices, but anywhere between 298 dollars and the, uh lower, the lower high trend line, which is coming in at 307
so 298 to 307 dollars would be my area where i'll be adding into a short position
i'll be targeting the first target, which is going to be between 232 and 216 dollars
if i just zoom out over here, i can give you guys a bit more perspective
second target, if it starts to lose these levels, it will be a hundred and forty dollars bnb
just bear in mind that when it comes to this token, this will depend on what the bitcoin price does
if bitcoin manages to come down to 21 000, then i would say this is more likely going to play out
so let's look at it with our emas and see what it's showing on this chart over here
every time that it tries to get back towards the 200, it doesn't even make it there
it comes back down, tries to get back up, fails, tries to get back up, fails
so i would say that the thesis of bnb is still catching up to the rest of the market and retracing 80 as opposed to its current 60

[Music], what is up, my crypto legends? how is everyone doing today? hope you're having a fantastic day
we're gonna check out some potential scenarios, some potential opportunities here for bitcoin
yesterday we were talking about some major levels on a video that did not get respected one single bit, which was absolutely crazy
we just, of course, i mean, this doesn't matter because, um, i got stopped out from the, from the trade here
i had 25 percent left from my position, okay? that i did from the short position, of course, that i still had open
and also, um, i've exited the trade, okay, 20 of the trade round about this area, just a few hours ago
so i am in totally no trade position on primex bt or on buybit, zero trades i have open at this moment
all right, you know, from here, from this level, this pump here, from this drop here
we've also no trade inside of this zone we were talking about, that descending triangle, double bottom
also getting that major rejection from this level, beautiful trade all the way here, just a couple of days ago
and, um, yeah, just got stopped out because it had a, i was at break even
i was expecting this level to have some resistance, all right, after this big, massive drop
of course, you know, this level has been less significant right now because it's just been slicing through, you know, several times for the last few days, the six 30 dollar range
but now, you know, it's been slicing through the last few days, so it's less relevant at this moment
now, i want to talk about, you know, who has been trading the last few days? because, i mean, yesterday, i've been trading quite a lot last few, a few days, you know, one week, one, two weeks, and made some really nice gains
but, yeah, i just, i don't see any opportunities at this moment
i'm just kind of chilling where, you know, waiting for this volatility
but analyzing the charts today, there was actually a very, very, you know, i've seen, i haven't checked the chart since yesterday evening, actually
so this is why, you know, i've been almost, uh, yeah, 24 hours without, you know, doing some proper analysis on bitcoin, on the price movements for the last 24 hours
but i've just seen something, you know, there was a major trading opportunity, um, yesterday night, okay, yesterday night here, central european time, at 10 o'clock
and i want to explain you why there was a good training opportunity right at this level, if we take a look at the daily chart
i want to start off, okay, with some major levels, of course, and talking about this opportunity that there was, um, yesterday, and what major levels we need to see, okay, to break and to bounce as resistance and support
but i want to explain yesterday, what was the major trade okay? this was an insane level over here
remember, you know, just a few days ago, this was on the 6th of january, where we did actually take this, well, i did take this short, okay, round about the 31 500 range
and it's, it's super important to have your daily levels marked up because, you know, every every some other day, you do have important daily levels, and you need to mark them
the more daily closes and opens, you do have it at, uh, at one level, it makes it stronger
as you can see, all the way down here, we have an insane daily level
this is round about the twenty eight thousand six hundred dollar range
okay? we have one, two, and we have another, um, another two right over here
it is definitely an important level where we could see a major, big bounce before we actually continue to the downside
so that is definitely an area where we could find some good opportunities
if we do see the price falling aggressively, you know, you might think to yourself, okay, where, where is it going to stop? where do we have the possibility in getting a potential balance? and i can tell you already that the twenty eight thousand six hundred dollar range, okay, plus minus, minus, you know, maybe a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars because of of potential volatility
so being extremely cautious, but looking for that, you know, nice balance at that level if we were to have that aggressive drop
now, what i want to show you here also, you know, the another reason why we had, you know, major confluence when we did get this short opportunity
all right, what was the confluence i was, you know, basically on the video that i was talking about, was this major, solid support level, this large consolidation that we had as support, which was around about the 31 000, you know, 400, 500, uh, dollar range
and, you know, it was enough confluence for me to actually take that short
now, but what was also, you know, um, why was it also a good short position? because it was a major daily level
another one, another close here, where we had this big, massive doji, as you can see on the daily, absolutely insane doji
this we were looking for shorting positions, okay, at this level
um, that was an insane shorting opportunity right there that i did take
and, um, basically, look, we have the open also here, right? the open of this candle at 31 756
this is basically where we touched almost the exact dollar, hitting that daily level, getting rejected
so what happened a few days ago is that we did manage to create an important daily level also, which was this close and this open
right? where is this closed and open? it is exactly at the 31 342 dollars
all right? and if you take a look here at this major high, we almost touched this range yesterday, almost to the exact dollar, okay, of this daily level
so let me just go to the full audi chart, okay, right over here to just to show you, okay, the daily close, the daily close was right over here, okay? daily close from this level
and also what happened, we touched to perfection, the trend line from the lower highs
okay, round about 10 o'clock, nine o'clock, approximately that time, central european time
and we also almost kind of touch with just a few dollars away from this daily level that we did create on the 6th and the 7th of january
once you have your first touch, look how you get that insane bounce from this major level
so you've got, you know, you know, i can prove to you many, many examples how daily levels are usually very well respected
the more daily levels you have at, you know, daily closes, sorry, you have an opens
where did that price action get respected exactly at that major level
you just touched it here with the wick and came straight back down
and what? what did we have yesterday? we had that daily level touched here, almost to perfection
okay? we got to say that we were a few dollars, a few dollars away from this level, but it was already, you know, a major trading opportunity
you know, hitting that risk, that um resistance trend line from lower highs
all right, hitting the daily level from this range, this consolidation, getting that wick up, okay, and touching that resistance, that was really a great shorting opportunity, at least to the six, one, eight from this big, aggressive pump, all right? that we did have
and same price action that we have been having um for the last few days
you know, massive, big pumps, massive, big dumps, coming all the way down from the pump
i mean, this is unexpected price action, of course, coming all the way up from the actual dump
this is why most of the times i trade big consolidations, big, you know, um, you know, reactions to certain levels
and this is where i will be taking the trade if i take a look at some levels that i've talked about
i do not place limit orders, because this is what could happen
no matter how strong a level is, i do not trade it till i see a reaction at that range
i mean, this was pretty, pretty cool trade right over there, that shortening opportunity to the daily level, lower high resistance, and aiming at least to the, to the six one eight or to the 50 percent levels from this pump
you know, you actually got that reaction here on the four hourly, as you can see, having that before hourly close end open exactly at the six one eight, six, five
so just, you know, just just something to point out guys there
um, we're looking for those pretty nice, pretty nice opportunities at that range
you know, we did get that beautiful consolidation here, as you can see on the one hourly chart
just getting those wicks here to the upside, that consolidation
it is a big, big support level that is turning into resistance
are we going to create a lower high in the next coming days and continue back down on the dxy? let me ask here the community, and i'm going to say hello straight away, do you think, do you think the dollar index is going down in the coming weeks? let me know, guys, because it's a pretty, pretty hard one here
let's take a look here at the comment have a look at the comment section
lunchtime update from andy says, priest of crypto, yo, yo, thanks for joining online
i've just closed the only position that i had open, which was the long position from this range
okay, so i would have to lean slightly bearish, you know, aggressive lower highs here
you know, my take here is very likely, in the next coming days, you know, coming back down to re revisit these low levels
so, um, yeah, we could actually do a little bit of, um, shortterm analysis to see if we can find some major levels, or, like using the svp, okay, the major point of controls from the uh, from the days, and maybe look for a day trade scalping opportunity
okay, but first of all, let me just go through the comment section
because of these aggressive lower highs, big, massive volatility
you know, we did have some some kind of bearish news um coming out, also for crypto and bitcoin, which we can go through
to all crypto owl, crypto legends in the house, yes, we are all crypto legends here
the next coming years, we are sorted if we are going to be here for the next coming years in crypto, expect some big, massive volatility and some potential downtrend
we having one of the best opportunities of a lifetime for the next coming years
we just need to be extremely patient and take those massive hits
janice from somalia, how are you doing, my man? thanks for joining
andy, can you please have a look at gold again? per christian vomit, i did exit my gold trade
i have exited all of my um trades here on gold on on natural gas
um, my gold price did came all the way, uh, back down to my, to my entry point
but basically on gold, what we do see is a very, very strong uptrend
okay? we can see this very, very strong uptrend on gold, okay? um, as you can see here, all the way from march of 2021, right when we had this big, big correction, from 20 august 2020, all right, going from the 2 000 per ounce, going all the way down to 1 700 here, is kind of where we bottomed out
some people might think that gold has created a double top, but for the moment, you know, in this range
for the last one, one and a half years, we have been creating, you know, this really nice uptrend, as you can see, with higher lows
so there's also this bat pattern that we know, we did find out on the stream
i do, even though i exited my, my trade, i still think, you know, we can reach that one thousand nine hundred 920 an ounce of gold in the next, you know, i was aiming for a couple of weeks at least, because this is the daily chart
and we've also got this bat pattern that we can take a look right now here
with the bat pattern that i do have, i'm going to just take it out, i'm going to bring it out here at this moment
the bat pattern here, having these well respected levels from x to a
the reason why x here held pretty nicely was because we created this, you know, higher low
but then you hit here, almost to perfection, hitting that consolidation, the 088, which is from x to d
this is what you need from the back pattern or okay, you still have some room also from c to d, which would be in between the 16 and the 26 fibonacci in this case, it's 21, 14
most importantly, hitting that point 88, right round number 88, having that quick consolidation and having that bounce speed thanks to the trend line
so what is the projected move from this bat pattern? is, of course, coming to the six, one, eight range from c to d
all right? and the c 618 range is also a big, major resistance level
so there's no doubt in my mind, okay, that we will be getting, you know, that resistance at the 618 level, because we can see the price of gold getting that consolidation
it's just very, very likely, you know, once we drop down this level, look at this daily wick over here
you know, look how many daily closers you do have here on gold
once you have the first daily major level, okay? the daily major candle here breaking down, you are looking for that touch, you are
but, you know, this actually hit this daily level to perfection, as you can see, after that solid daily breakout, you know, this is basically confirming the breakout on gold
this level is exactly the hundred and twenty dollars, one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen dollars, approximately, wick in here
so for the moment, we do have that projected move here on on on gold, from this bat pattern, of course
okay, uh, projected move would be hitting this, this 9 000, sorry, this 1 920
it's enough confluence for me to believe that this is going all the way up there, uh, in the next coming weeks, as this is the daily chart, it might, you know, takes a lot, a little bit more time here with these consolidations, to climb up to this range
okay? you deposit ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred
you deposit a hundred thousand dollars, you're getting seven thousand dollars
okay? that is the maximum bonus that you can get, seven thousand dollars on top, okay? which is basically seven percent added to your deposit
here on primax bt, they have a bunch of assets to trade with, okay, uh, such as gold, s p 500
and you can use bitcoin crypto as collateral ethereum and usdt
uh, as stable, stablecoin for for trading on prime xpt, which is amazing, right? let's take a look here
says, crypto ow absolutely so that was the quick update on gold
how are you doing buying bitcoin? and sheba, dips for a few weeks, isn't a real worry
just sit back, relax and do not lose your mind watching the price every 15 minutes, says crypto burger, absolutely true
as a trader, i do like to analyze the charts for one, two hours
we tried to make some money also trading, guys, and last couple of weeks has been absolutely insane
i'm definitely gonna hold, uh, you know, those trading gains in bitcoin, some stable coins, uh
i do see the markets going lower, so best that you can dollar cost average for me, in my personal opinion
but i, i just like, um, accumulating some bitcoin and ethereum at uh, you know, at this moment in time, uh, still in my short from 31k
i think that we can go to lower levels, of course, that is the higher probability
we are actually consolidating right now at this super important level that we were talking about, okay, which is the thirty thousand six hundred dollars
we are consolidating at this range, not managing to get above
i would say that, yeah, the higher, highest probability scenario would be coming down from this range
we are very likely going to come down after having the retest of this resistance trend line, to retest support
we could do some shortterm analysis on bitcoin here, of course
we actually hitting the six, we did hit the six one eight here, to perfection
let's go to the 30 minute chart and look for those day trades
we do know that this level is big resistance, the thirty thousand seven hundred, thirty thousand six hundred
this is the 30 minute chart from the highs of yesterday to the lows of early this morning
we we just touched to the exact dollar, the 618 level, which was pretty, pretty crazy
hitting the six one eight levels, hitting this big, you know, resistance zone range, and it's just very, very likely to to continue back down, of course
i mean, shorting right now, can you short right now from this range? you are a little bit late
you are very, very likely going to come down to, you know, at least the lows here of twenty nine thousand eight hundred dollars to retest this low zone
um, yeah, not much to add on on this immediate short term analysis
but we are getting the consolidation for the last few hours, which is enough for me to think that this is getting, this is very, very, very much getting resistance, uh, from the, you know, pump drop, you know, massive, massive, massive pumping dumps
and what is basically happening right now, this is getting exhausted price action as getting, is getting that consolidation from this range
and it does look like, by the looks of things, with the selling pressure, with the lower highs, that we are looking for lower
on the 30 30minute chart, all right, we're basically focusing on bitcoin analysis, of course, then we can take a look at some awkwards and some other assets
you know, looks like we had a pretty nice, pretty pretty nice
on the 30minute chart, volume is a bit mixed up here, but, but, but we got the aggressive drop, abc, and it's very likely to retest these lows and potentially break it
i do see us hitting the twenty eight thousand eight hundred, eight hundred and fifty dollars, maybe in the next coming hours
it very much looks like it's just gonna come down to this range
i will be getting an insane video update, um, afterwards tonight, or have it ready for tomorrow morning
with some more deep analysis, sell your coins, dump incoming um, yeah, it's up to you guys
i am, uh, accumulating, depending if you're trading or not, i'm accumulating bitcoin and ethereum
and i'm holding some stable coins on the sidelines, just for that black swan event
i i really, you know, last time, when we are, when we had the black swan event in march of 2020, i was fully invested in in crypto already, and i didn't have any dry powder, like i say, which would be stable coins, ready to buy the big, major drop
and this time, you know, i do think that at some point, you know, maybe this year, maybe next year, we will have that huge, aggressive drop of right, a recession, bad news, you know, world is gonna absolutely collapse
the economy is collapsing, or, i don't know, um, anything, you know, any bad news worldwide
you know, if we do get bitcoin down to 10k levels, which some analysts are calling, some crazy people are calling, you know, that might be not as crazy
and i'm telling you that i'm having, you know, a huge amount of stable coins out on the sidelines also, because i'm not putting 100 of my income, of my, you know, the trading gains, of my, of my stable coins, not 100, into crypto, you know, at least having 30, 40, around that range in stable coins
so just in case you have an insane black swan event, you have a massive, big drop to go all in, basically, not all in
but yeah, i definitely drop, you know, at least 50 of my stable coins if we do have a very, very scary, aggressive drop, such as march of of of 2020
i mean, this is the thing, i only had 500 in, you know, spare 500 in my bank account
i was still working as a welder here, still doing metal work for yachts
and, um, basically, i dollar cost averaged through this range
just a quick story i want to say here, then i go through the comment section
i started trading in crypto here mid 2018, approximately, okay
i started accumulating and buying and start trading crypto around about, you know, 2019ish, approximately
when this happened, i i only had 500 that i could actually buy into cryptocurrency
i actually bought vchain on this big, massive drop, you know, only a few hundred dollars during the next few weeks, uh, in april, into bitcoin and ethereum, because i just didn't have, you know, more
it was already invested fully in crypto, all that, you know, during these last few years, the these last couple of years, 2018, 2019
so i, you know, if we do have this, with this kind of drop, you know, in crypto, in bitcoin, you know, a 60 drop in just a couple of weeks, i want to be ready, because that would be absolutely insane
you know, just imagine if we do have that 60 drop that could happen, guys
you know, it could happen from 30 000, from 35 000, you know, round about this range
just imagine in the next coming weeks, coming months, you know, if you do get that, you know, 40, 50 percent drop, it would be absolutely insane
i want to have some dry powder ready to absolutely, you know, mark it by, wow, as much as i can with my stable coins at those levels
so, yeah, don't don't think i'll feel sad if we go down there
i'll be very, very excited, because i do have a huge amount of curve of stable coins
i am ready for that aggressive drop, because it will be an opportunity of a lifetime
it's, it's just, i didn't have enough here to invest in this range
and i did know, you know, on the bottom of my heart, i did know that this was the moment, this was the moment
i just didn't have much, uh, you know, much to invest, basically
but, yeah, i wasn't, um, yeah, i just, you know, this is, i really did learn that this is not what you should do
i just invested the 500 and, you know, in less than one year, i was like, wow
but anyway, yeah, it's not the way, it's not the way to invest
of course, make sure to to, you know, pile as much more stable coins and also stable coins to have them ready
they are my, you know, the most trusted, actually trust a little bit more usdc
and the good thing about having stable coins, you know, as soon as you have this drop, you know, you can transfer it to an exchange in in 10 minutes and get into there and buy these cryptos
of course, if you have it in your bank account, if you have euros, dollars, you know, yens, whatever, until you transfer it and everything, you know, 24 hours, can it can pass
you cannot make a fast buy of, of, uh, tens of thousands of dollars, right? you can buy with credit card, of course, five hundred dollars, thousand dollars
but i have a lot on stable coins, so i could make a fast buy, um, if this drop happens, right? enough
you want to know who the hell you are following, right? when i started investing in crypto, you know, just a little bit of my story, guys
i got my brother, i got my mum into crypto, down at these levels, and, um, i got my mum to get one bitcoin, of course
i didn't have more than 500 to invest back in, you know, march of 2020
so, you know, just just to see how things can turn around in in a matter of of you know, one year, basically, when i was working here as a welder
you know, the next coming years are the most exciting years that are gonna happen
what have we got here? what have we got here for waves? i got some i got here on the super chat saying that, you you know, you have longed at um
okay, let's take a look at this and analyze the situation, right? there is something good about waves at this moment
you know, the huge amount of volume that has happened right now with this pump
we have real, big volume on the pump, on waves here, which is very, very good
i mean, it's the highest volume, that's that we've ever had for the last, you know, one to two years
um, august of 2020 was the highest spike from the actual pump that we've had at this level
i mean, this is a good sign of potential close to the bottom, right? when you have high volume like this, you know, this is big money
and you can see these signs, you know, this is not a few million dollars, uh? this is, uh, quite, quite a huge chunk of, of, um, of millions, right there
um, so, yeah, just just a quick so that is a kind of a good sign here on waves
all right, the big, big volume that we have had from this pump
let me just go ahead back to the binance chart and check out, check out these major levels
because what we could see here on on waves, this is the four hourly chart
the reason why we have created this huge amount of volume on the vpvr, is, because of this large consolidation, a potential retest from these highs is very, very likely, in my opinion
look how we did break this level and did get an insane bounce from this range
i do think that this range, i would look for a stop loss, stop loss around about the 630
we've got a nice consolidation area that should be holding as support, uh, here around about the 50 fibonacci and the 618 volume is going down
i mean, what would be the biggest exchange here for forum volume? finance us
i don't want to see binance, because it's calculated, or calculated by trading view, but i guess bitfinex
you can clearly see though, that the volume, the buying pressure, is much higher
so at some point, the most likely scenarios is that the bulls, you know, the the large institutions, the big investors, are going to, you know, get in at these levels
i mean, i'm saying institutions, i'm going to say, you know, millionaires, basically
but, i mean, it does have a pretty large market capitalization
but, um, yeah, the big jump that we did have from four dollars all the way up here to eight nine dollars um
all right, so this is a jump of investment, you know, of about 300 million dollars coming into the market
so what is, you know, happening right here? there's a little bit of selling pressure, of course, with the current market situation
okay? i mean, it's already been a pretty interesting level here, 50 at the 770, 780 and 618, even better down at the 680
so you could still have that one dollar, uh, drop here and and a little bit of more consolidation
you know, for me, it's a must buy, especially if you're gonna have, you know, continuation with low volume on waves, um
but it's starting to be a good buy zone already, depending low leverage
of course, i would be risking point five percent of my, of my capital, uh, i might, i might actually long this
i will inform in the telegram group if i'm long in waves, but, uh, very likely i might
you know, i'm gonna wait for a potential another drop or something, or a larger consolidation
and, you know, if i'm willing to risk one or two percent of my capital, then i would put 055 percent on my capital here, just in case we do have that drop, and then we do consolidate, i would be adding another 05 so then my average entry can ladder down
i can ladder into the entry here, just in case we have the second consolidation, because this might drop
okay, remember, i would only add to my position if we see that the 618 is holding nicely, because this could actually do this
this is why you need to have very, very good risk management and wait for the good opportunity at 618 level here on, on, on waves, where we do see this large consolidation
like i said, it looks like that this is ready for a potential another leg up
after there's such a huge, aggressive drop, most of the people are going to think that, yes, of course, we are beneath the major support
basically, the whales want to get into the best price possible, dipping below the lows of 2021 here, all right? dipping below the lows of 2021 entire, you know, even even 2020, even december of 2020
so it's below the lowest, it's below levels from two years ago
most of the people might think, you know, this is going to be huge resistance zone, and we are going to continue down
there's something fishy here, from, from, from waves, when you see this kind of price action
um, but yeah, if you are responsible, of course, if you do have risk, good risk management
and also they have usdt perpetual, which you can trade with usdt
it's up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus, and you get 30 days free
and you also can get a huge amount of bonuses on the rewards hub, which is up to four thousand fifty dollars, if you are interested
uh, like i said, looking for that consolidation at this level
volume is going down at this retracement coming into this consolidation
uh, i think it is pretty good, pretty good to add up into position, if we do go to slightly lower levels and go sideways
so pumped for a mafia club, chrissy, what is that? ape mafia club? oh, my goodness
are you talking about the long heat on waves, or depend you know, what kind of risk management, if you, you know, a 3x on these cryptos, or is already good, okay? because, uh, these cryptos pump and dump
you know, look at the pump that we did have in just a few days right over here, you know, from three dollar eight, from four dollars all the way up tier two to ten dollars
if you are using a 3x leverage, that is already, you know, almost a 500
you do not have to use much leverage on where, on waves, on altcoins, i the leverage that i use on altcoins is about 3, 4x
you know, depending, you know, the best the lower the market capitalization, the the less leverage i use, of course, because if you're using a 10x on this, yeah, your liquidation price is going to be very, very close to to your entry
um, andy, what strategy do you use? uh, depending on what i i use multiple strategies
dave mark, dutch guys, thank you very much for the insane support
andy, how to be sure that bitcoin will never collapse? um, how to be sure that bitcoin will never collapse? there's nothing, there's nothing certain
you know, can it collapse? yeah, it can collapse, but it will very likely recover, recover in the future
okay, the the potential collapse can happen on bitcoin, you know, a big, major drop, a big, major panic sell
but, um, yeah, we it's, we do not know if it, if it's gonna happen or not
so if it does, it's gonna be pretty good for a buying opportunity
um, andy, what's your prediction on caster? there's really good
caster is lagging behind a lot, but most of the crypto projects do lag
i mean, we can, we can talk about a bunch of crypto projects that have always been lagging behind, you know, potential, uh, you know, launch dates
so, you know, cardano, cardano has been one of the most lagging blockchain projects
i think caster will be launching, you know, the application in the next coming months
they want to really make, you know, the best out of this application
and they are going to, the big businesses are going to integrate caster for payments, which is, you know, in huge news, uh, it's just going to take a lot, a lot of time, regulation, guys
you know, the deal after this lunar collapse, of course, and this bear market sentiment
uh, caster is looking to launch the application and get all of these partners in and do the marketing at the best moment possible, not in a bear market, because it's really not, it's not, there a very smart thing to do, of course, with the crypto market sentiment, you know, launching an, uh, a crypto project right now in a bear market, it's just not the it should be, correct, because then you have time to develop and for the ball run and everything
but yeah, it's not the kind of right thing to do, because you're not going to get supported
so, um, i'm just reading, i'm just answering kind of all of these questions at the at the moment
andy, do you think dogecoin is a goodbye? dogecoin is one of those, um, dogecoins is one of those meme coins that will survive, very likely
i mean, shiva, you know, we've got an insane article here on the bitcoin census website
this is the actual article, news that we did post yesterday on the bitcoin center website
because shiba inu, no doubt in my mind, will survive the bear market
is going to be one of those meme coins that is going to survive the bear market, you know, very, very likely
there are gonna be some of those, you know, all coins that that will survive
i mean, let me just go here to the threeday chart and and zoom out a little bit
because basically we are at that, at the range, okay? and we are at the highs
we are at the highs from, uh, february of 2021, you know, march, april
we're just hitting this, uh, you know, this daily weekly level right there at the eight cent level, and it's just holding, holding this range
i would be extremely cautious, because we could have one more leg down
if we do still have this bearish sentiment where there's no doubt in my mind that we're gonna have that leg down and, you know, probably retest the lows, probably retest the lows of this range, okay, which would be around about the four five cent level
if you are bullish in this, in this, uh, project, i would wait a little bit more
you know, bear markets are very, very, very, very, very boring
look at dogecoin all the way back in 2018, all the way here till late 2020
you know, it's starting to be a good accumulation zone right now, here on dogecoin, you can see dogecoin here, you know, at a fraction of a penny
and when you are trading like that for months, you know, you you can arguably discuss that that is the bottom
it is a little bit too soon, because we've only just dropped a few days ago
um, i'm not gonna say, trust me, but it's probably going to be round about this range, okay, inside of this range where it's going to be quite boring, okay? and finding a floor level and having this kind of price action for quite some bit
will it be the four cents, three cents? it might be around about these levels
we've only just had this aggressive drop, you know, just a few weeks ago
i know, a good, a good level to bounce if we do have an aggressive drop, will be that 45 level
if we do lose this level, which we are just about, we are consolidating here for a long time from the highs created here in january
if we do lose this level, yeah, no doubt in my mind, there will be a big bounce from this range, a big balance
well, it might be, you know, a 10 pump, 20 pump, we would have to analyze, you know, some some levels if we do get that drop
so your question, is this a good level to buy? well, um, yeah
um, we can go lower, but definitely a good level to start accumulating
samseb what's going on? um, thank you for sharing your knowledge, says carlos
let me take a look at the mods chat, because i can see here's a lot of, a lot of, um, reversal diamond pattern
what's going on? mark dutch, i've got someone here saying, are we creating a reversal, uh, diamond pattern? i'm not sure
okay, i hope, once i am, once it's official, that i am going to be a leader on the world trade, world series of trading guys
you need to join, because i need at least 10 people, and i hope at least 10 people from the community, because i'm gonna absolutely analyze the chart every single day
all right, because i want to absolutely crush it on this world series of trading, guys
i'm definitely going to think that some of my moderators are going to join here, this by bit competition, because we'll be doing, i i would very likely be doing a separate group for all of those people that have actually joined
so i need you, if you're going to join my team on the world series of trading, all right, on buybit, you need to join the telegram
and once i see the people that have been joining my team, i will be saying it on every single video, on every single live stream, and i'll be doing a just a private group just for the world series of trading, because we'll be analyzing together
because, trust me, if we are going to be in the top 10, we're going to have huge prizes for everyone
we're going to try and look for the biggest, you know, trading opportunities
i will let you know once i am a leader on the world series of trading, and i will be saying it on every single video, on every single live stream
and of course, we'll be doing a separate telegram group just for the world series of training, just to analyze, because it's going to be on for a couple of weeks
we need to absolutely crush it if our name, okay, is in the top 10
when the trading competition, competition ends, it's going to be absolutely huge
and, yeah, i'm really, really excited because only, we're going to do only the best of the best
i wish it would have been the last couple of weeks, you know, that trading competition, if the trading competition would have started at this level, oh, my goodness
you know, the amount of percentage here in gains would have been absolutely huge
uh, we we can make a huge, a huge, huge thing on on the world series of trading competition on bibit, which is in the next coming weeks
it would have been, if the trading competition would have been started here, oh, my goodness
i mean, i rode a trade all the way up here, took profits here, shorted this, wow
but we just have to find more opportunities, opportunities every single day on on bitcoin, on crypto
um, natalie, bitcoin census, how are you doing? i got natalie here in the comment section
how are you doing? um, uh, for huge account, for top ranking, or it is a win rate in percentage? um, well, it all depends
all depending on your size of the account, because they can see that, obviously, with a lot, with a little bit with algorithm
okay, they can see the percentage, oh, and the amount of your account
so it all goes with percentage on average of your account, if that makes any sense
uh? because, yeah, someone come can trade with a five million um dollar account, and then there's another one with a 5 000, uh account
and then, yeah, is it just because he has five million he's going to win? no
and of course, you could not make huge percentage of trades with one cent trade
this is not going to be valid because, you you know, i can make thousands of percent of gains, you know, just risking one cent
it's an average of what you have on your account and the percentage amount
so if you turn five thousand dollars into ten thousand dollars in in two weeks, then, wow, you're an absolute machine
they're gonna see that you've doubled your account and money you've gained, you know, um, over 100, you know, multiple, maybe hundreds or thousands of percent on your trade
so, turning five thousand to ten thousand, uh, are you going to turn five million into ten million? this is the thing, maybe the account of five million can only make, uh, one million
so the if the account of five million makes one million and turns it into six million, then the account that turns five thousand into ten thousand dollars is going to win, because it has a better winning rate, bigger percentage um
and how you your double your account of course, if not, it wouldn't be fair
it wouldn't be fair, right? um, yeah, i'm getting some laughs here
um, it's not about the size of the account, but how you use it, says everyone with a small account
can you see an ascending triangle of btc on the four hourly chart? an ascending triangle on bitcoin on the four hourly chart? let's take a look at this
i mean, i can see this, right? we are creating lower highs here on the four hourly and we've got a solid base
if i can see a descending triangle, i could not see an ascending triangle
let me know if this, just give me a thumbs up if this is the kind of ascending triangle that you are looking at
i think the most likely scenario here, creating these lower highs is potentially coming down, like i just explained on bitcoin on the on the buy bit chart
okay, if we take a look at with a buy bit chart, we were taking a look here on the 30 minutes, this kind of abc correction on this aggressive drop that we did have, this kind of one, two, three, hitting the sixty percent from this drop
the twenty nine thousand eight hundred dollars is very, very possible
you know, i might not be trading today, tomorrow, till i really find the next big opportunity
guys, hope you stay tuned, because i will be saying it on the telegram, on the live stream, you know, on on the videos, like i have been doing for the last couple of weeks if i do take any big trades
cardano, cardano, let's take a look at cardano, um, i'd love to have a ledger
okay, you know, you need to win, you know, these these giveaways in bitcoin
you know, i've been saying, come on, guys, if we get 2 000 likes on this video, and there's over 5 000 views on average on my daily video updates
i'm not going to say, guys, if you, you know, if there's 500 likes on this video, no, it's going to be a big amount of likes for that giveaway, of course
he's asking this question, uh, all the way up to 30 800 and then dump
38 800, as you can see here on this wick, uh, that we are probably on our way down here
all right, remember, it was a big value area high from this trading range
but this consolidation is telling me that something is going to happen here
let me just take a look at the weeklies if we can find um, yeah, no, major weekly level
i mean, this is the thing, four hourly levels, four hourly level, we got, we got a big rejection yesterday from this daily and four hourly level
you touched it here to perfection, touching the lower high resistance
i think we're going to be range trading for the next couple of days, inside of this level, in between the twenty nine thousand three hundred dollars and also, you know, slightly below the thirty one thousand five hundred
i think there's not gonna be a breakout in the in the next coming hours
uh, i think a retest from 29 300 is, is, is very, very possible
and also let's take a look at, uh, what's going on with cardano? having a little bit of pumpy action
[Music], it's looking [Music], right, right, right, right, right
you know, where cardano did break the resistance trend line from these lower highs, right there
of course, like i say, uh many times, this is also for the dxy
but it doesn't mean that we can go too much higher, higher, higher levels and create a higher high
because this we've, we've actually made a lower low on cardano
and you might think we've broken the trend line here from these lower highs, it's time to go to higher
and we actually respected this to the exact scent, just wicking and hitting that trend line from these lower highs to the exact scent
so this does potentially mean that, you know, we are maybe ready to get a nice bounce that we are getting right now, and we're going to go higher
i think the big, big, big level here on cardano is the 80 cent range
it's a big, solid support range, big, solid support range right there
from this high to the low, can go to slightly higher levels there's a big, big resistance on cardano from 70 cents already, 618
we can actually revisit the lows, uh? because what's happened here on cardano, basically, we are, we are at the value area high from the volume profile, from the trading zone of the last, you know, 30 days
this is 30 days of trading, looking at the four hourly from the 10th, you know, 12th of may, all the way to the 9th of june, which is today
potential double top beyond cardano is is, is very, very possible
if we do get another price action, you know, hitting, hitting this level of, uh, 68 cent, potentially going to 70 cent and getting rejection
oh, this is gonna be, like, yeah, it's gonna be like an abc, you know, kind of formation
we have the big drop that did start here on the 5th of may, from this small, little pump that we did have aggressive drop
abc, kind of correction, hitting the 50 618, consolidating here, not managing to go higher
well, i do have people here in the comment section saying, cardano, this has been cardano analysis right now
did see some people asking for algorand, uh, andy, i always like your videos
uh, off the youtubers that i follow, just a simple button to hit to pay them
let's take a look at algorand right away, i've got people here
i mean, this is something that we were, we were talking about for a long time, you know, right? these these five waves and al goran creating this massive, aggressive abc correction
big investors, massive blockchain project, you know, uh, huge partnerships
it's, i think it is going to be one of the l1, it is going to be one of the l1 projects
so this is one of them that will survive the bear market, of course, and will go to much higher levels, something that we were analyzing here on algorand and a good way to detect the bottom here for the next coming months
all right, just to keep it extremely simple, it is very unlikely that we are going to go below the lows of the bear market
okay? in this case it would be around about the 10 cents here, the the march 2020 crash
there are some cryptos already below this level, i think, such as um eos
eos is below the march 2020 crash, which is absolutely insane
this one's one of those that's, you know, it was one of the most populars on the bull run back in 2017, i think is what it was
now, it's, it's below the, it is below the bear market lows from the last cycle, which is crazy
it won't be the case, in my opinion, for algorand, like i've just done analysis
you know, this is something that we, we did analyze a long time ago
if you, if you take a look at the elliott wave counts on algorand, and we can go to the logarithmic chart, you know, it does look like, it does look like, from the ultimate low levels of al goran's existence, which is here on march of 2020, we do have, you know, a low, we do have a low where we do have some waves, we have the start of some waves
and you can see here that we have perfectly created five waves all right to the peak of the market
obviously, we did have this volatility, massive wick, if i would, i remember being in the trade here, and, um, didn't have any take profits
my the trade actually ended in a loss, but if i would have had to take profit, at least to ultimates, you know, there was a big, massive wick
my mods must remember that al goran trade that i did take here
you know, we have five, you know, waves, as you can see here, two, perfection
okay? if you take that look at elliott wave theory, we can see, you know, from the ultimate low levels, uh, from march of 2020
just to keep it simple here, whoever doesn't know elliott wave count theory, we can, i can just get here something
yeah, basically, you know, five waves here on on this as you can see here on the chart
we have five waves on our grand created from the march lows, as you can see, to the alltime highs that we did create here in 2021
we are in a very, very aggressive correction, of course, since the alltime high, you can see it here on the picture, right? this is just the basic, right? five wave counts
of course, the abc correction can go in between the top of the wave one and the low of the wave two
it can consolidate in between this region, the abc count, the c count, can actually arrive in between the top of the first wave and the low part of the second wave, meaning that, you know, if this, if you are bullish on algorand for me, this has already been a very, very good accumulation level
can we even reach the lows here, of 20 cent level on our grand yeah, maybe it can
we we really don't know how aggressive, you know, the the economy, the recession can be
but this has already been very interesting levels, as it has been a very, very large accumulation level on algorand if you are looking to dollar cost average, i would say that this is starting to be the price levels to do that
you can see the spike on the vp vr, massive, big volume traded
um, it's, this has already been very, very nice levels for accumulation
so that would be the the kind of mid long term analysis on um on algorand guys, this is gonna be, wow, absolutely insane
i'm going to get a video prepared taking a look at what could happen for bitcoin, looking at the most important levels, of course, so we can take a look at those opportunities
if you have been an old subscriber, you've been watching the channel, you know i've been, you know, making some insane trades
right now, you know, it's a little bit of no man's land in my personal opinion
i do see us going lower, because we are creating this kind of descending triangle
a potential retest, of course, of the 29 300 um is is very, very likely in the coming days
um, so anyway, i will be getting a a video update, you know, looking at the most important levels, daily levels
remember, if you are interested in trading and you are an experienced one
most importantly, you've got insane bonuses for buybit and primex bt
primax bt has over 50 assets, not only crypto, it has s p 500, dow jones
i'm gonna chill out till tomorrow, maybe, until i find a really good, high probability trade
we've got the latest news and articles and technical analysis ideas, of course, so you can have some information
let's see, we're just gonna give everyone the content, as always, just one second, guys, before before i see what you write
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that so you can help me grow the channel and so we can reach out to more people
i was actually at a restaurant a couple of days ago, and i ate and jara, and it was this very beautiful song
um, and i found a song, but, she, but she told me it was from ethiopian
so, yeah, i don't, i know, i know that sounds so bad, but, michael bay, really good song is like this love song
i love music from all over the world, and that song was, mwah
if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
if you saw my video, i sold the market right here at thirty thousand five hundred and sixty eight
and my take profit is at one to eight thousand six hundred and sixty
um, i took on on, i took take profit 2 as a to ask my take profit
and i'm gonna show you exactly what, um, why i took this trade
if you didn't see the video that i posted today, um, it was a couple of hours ago
um, if you didn't see that, obviously you already kind of know
um, okay, so when we [Laughter], she, she's going to roast you for that
um, okay, so let's see what what were we looking at? will roast it for you
uh, we were looking at the overall, where we're looking at the overall, um, and we were in, we're in a sideways market
and while i was recording the previous video, while i was recording the previous video, um, i saw it myself that even if we are inside a sideways market, it is really easy to lose money because you can see the market only comes to 50 of the range
so you can see that the market is just, yeah, it just goes to the middle, and then you go back to the support, you go back up to the resistance, you come back down and retest this choppy market right here, right? um
and then what i was looking at when it came to the to the lower time frames, because this morning live stream that we had, i was a little bit unsure what the market did, uh, what what it was supposed to do
uh, you who were on my live stream, uh, you who were on my live stream this morning know that i was, uh, i was unsure, which is totally fine, because that's why we cannot trade all the time, right? um
so then when we go down to the lower time frames, i think it was around, where was we? so this was 14, so i, yeah, so we were exactly at this candlestick on the one hour
uh, that's, uh, three, uh pm, or three, middle in the day when it comes to the american clock
okay, so the market, uh, so while i was recording, i was talking about on the lower time frames
we're looking at the 15 minutes chart, that if this candlestick right here that we we had on the 15 minutes, this was active while i was recording it
so i told you that if we're closing below 30, 30, 520, we would see a retest from that level, or potentially, because you can never be 100 sure, um, you we would see the retest and then see the market go down
you can also receive a bonus on buy with up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
by doing that and holding our position for a longer time is really good by when you have vibrate because of the low fizz
and you could also see on the the hourly after i was looking at it, because i was editing the video while i was having, while i had my the charts on the left side of me, and i was, i saw when the market came back up and retested it
did you understand why i took the trade, or are you confused? uh, oh, robot, i'm late
hello, pantone, how are you? but guys, did you understand why i took this trade? comments? did you in did you? do you understand it? hi, udaya, how are you? marine anna, you did? martine, also? sam, also
because i want to make sure that you understand what what i talk about
what do you think about b b, we can go to car uh, i said i was supposed to say we can go to carlos, but we can go to b and b, carlos, yes
uh, so what we can see right now then, um, i just think i would let the market go
obviously we can come back if we have a small higher low, uh, sorry, lower high right now
but looking at the higher time frames, we could also have, we just might also have to drag the fibonacci to higher targets
and you can see that from a, uh, the fibonacci from thirty thousand four hundred and forty five back down to the low at thirty thousand one hundred
so this just might be on the lower time frames where you see the pullback and then put the continuation, um, back down
okay, so what i did right here now now, i was looking at the 30 minute chart, so i took the fibonacci exactly to the lower high on the bodies, and i also took it precisely to the body of the low
and when we go to the five minutes chart, because on the 15 minutes chart, you can see that it's a week right here, it is one minute and 50 seconds left of this candlestick
and the wick that you see right here, looking at the 15 minutes chart
can you see how perfectly the candlestick closed exactly where the 50 is? like, you cannot even lie
like, can we zoom it even more? seriously? like, this is so perfect
this is why you should definitely practice these guys, because this is, everyone can do this
so, yeah, so what we're looking at is, obviously, now, if this could be the potential, potential, potential lower high and so, yeah, so, yeah, but looking, okay, so we have such a huge wick, right? but, yeah, we just have to wait and see
i'm already, as i told you, i'm already in a self position since the high i have traded me with a drug
how are you? uh, okay, it's the one joke i find funny in yours
okay, so well, even if the market on the fit on the five minutes chart, well, yeah, we just have to wait and see
you just might also see a push back up to thirty thousand one hundred three hundred and eighteen
but this is definitely a level where i would look at if i would want to find another entry
okay, so let's go to ada cardano, because i saw that was a request in the beginning
lauren seb um, i think it was, uh, okay, so for eman daniel, ada's eight
and i just want to start over, just to refresh everything so we understand what we look at
so this is the weekly chart, and the last lower low was at this level, at level around 07680
you know, after you said that, they just came and started to scream again
okay, if you're dragging fibonacci, sorry, i'm like this all the time, but it tickles in my nose
if we take a fibonacci from zero, uh, zero point eight thousand nine hundred and ninety, back down to the low at zero point four thousand four hundred, four thousand six hundred and thirty, we already retested the fifty percent
and i go to the two daily dog yeah, i just went to the two daily
but look at the 12 hourly also, where we could okay, so this is one that i that i would look at
so, i mean, we could definitely pull back up to the resistance, because not in a sideways market
but on the higher time frames, what we're looking at is a potential pullback on the weekly chart
um, we could see the market pull back up to zero point seven thousand seven hundred and fifty
but we, first of all, i would look at this fibonacci level that we're inside now, because you can already see how much we respect
but one thing to make sure that we're not, uh, we're not getting faked out, is based on this support trendline that we do have
um, we can have it something like this, because when we are inside this fibonacci level now, um, this is where we do expect the market to reverse back down, based on that, um, based on this fibonacci
okay, so now we're on the, now we are on the the one minutes chart
and the market is about to break the higher low that we do have right here around, let's see, 06 390, around that levels
and now, if the market starts to break the trend, we will break, uh, the low, the last, uh, higher low, potentially now create the lower low
and now, because remember that overall, we could see a push back up to the higher targets, right? so this is why we need to have the confirmations that this will actually, could possibly happen, right? and that is why, oh my god, there's something on my nose
so when if this, if the market now creates a lower low we need to surpass, we can also, of course, need to surpass this higher low, right? this is technically the previous higher low, i would say
and if we break, then six thousand three hundred and forty market creates the lower low
usually the market comes back up to create the first lower high
you take the fibonacci from the last higher high to the new lower low, because that will measure where the potential next lower high will be
because we are right now inside the higher time frames fibonacci
and then you can also see, by by using the trend line that we do have on the higher time frames, if we see, because the market tried to, right now, what we did was that we also tried to break this trend line
and remember that trend lines are always 90 more, uh, 90 more respected
which means that when we try to break it, the market usually don't have the power to do that
so we come back down inside and close ourselves up below the trend line that we tried to break
so if that is the case, all of this that happened will only be a fake out
and usually we can find, or i can find another entry when the market comes inside, and retest the same trend price from where we try to break it
because i always tell you that when the market creates another lower high, we need to change our um our trend line
but when we're looking at a fake out, i never, i never changed my, my trend line unl until we can actually see what the market actually did
did it give us a fake or not? because if i'm too quick to move the trend line, i don't know, because i need to know what the market's gonna do against the trend line
because because when the market now comes back up, and we see the market breaking inside below, it, will always retest the previous lower height you had before the the breakout candle
don't you use stop plus for your shorts? what? of course i do
are you talking to someone else? because i always use stoploss
guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
and i want to say, thank you so much guys for taking your time to listen to what i say
this is what i've been you know, what i've learned by back testing
and if you can apply this to your own trading, i'm super happy for that
and if sharing is caring, right? it is really sharing is caring, because i know how hard it is
i know a lot of you guys want to know prices and stuff like that, but it's actually pretty fun just to analyze the charts also and show you what i see
and natalie, yours and tom crones are my favorite streams to watch
two totally different, equally great tradies, but i love the contrast
okay, what else do you account in a4? and for you, you've said the same thing 10 times now
short and we'll be to say, maybe you want me to see it, but yes, i see it
if you're just a normal human being want me to see your comments? i saw it
guys, what do you want me to look at something? i'm trying to find it in the chat, but i, but i cannot see anything
also, um, if you want to be part of the community that we do have, we i am normally, okay, i see
um, if you want to be part of the community, bitcoin census community
um, you are more than welcome to be in here, because we share our thoughts, we share our knowledge, and it's very good
so if you want to be part with people that super chill, super good with each other, you can find very good friends
and you can have direct contact with me too, and ask me questions in the chat
um, and if there's anyone that's new on my channel, super welcome
um, i was actually looking at my my videos myself today and just before i went on this live stream, and just refreshed my, my mind myself
even if i do talk about it all the time, but i was looking at my market structure part one and part two, and they're actually pretty good
um, so if you are a beginner or want to understand more about what i talk about when it comes to market structure, these two are great
i might my own fan when it comes to this, because i do explain it in a very good way
and you have, you have, obviously other super good videos to look at
this is also where we just go through, uh, we just go through exactly what i see on the charts i practice with you
and this is the best thing for you to become a good trader and a very good technique and technique, technical analyst, is by back testing
so i was just thinking, if you want to do it with me, you can do it
oh, can we look at, quote, it all? okay, i saw called it on cool day on usdt, okay, so we're starting off with the higher time frame, first of all
and going back in time, it's always good to look at the left, because this is the last um support that we are very close to
we can also see that the wick down here is so it looks very bad for kadena
um, yeah, what to say? well, we did break the resistance trend line, but it doesn't look like technic
i'm not even going to analyze it, because i seriously do not know what's going to happen
um, you are at the low obviously you can see the market come back down and then see some push to the upside, or you just continue to see the breakdown of it
also, if you're going down to the lower time frames, you can see the market is a little doing lower highs, but overall, this is just a very, this is a sideways market
so either we see the market find the power to break the resistance, obviously, or we break the support, or we just continue, or we just might continue to just consolidate between one thousand one point eight thousand two hundred and ten and two point one thousand seven hundred and fifty
i was like, yeah, of course i'm gonna look at that one, carlos, yeah, right
okay, so so this looks exactly as, this looks exactly as bitcoin
it's really hard when we are in a sideways market, because we, okay, overall, we're still in a downtrend
a couple of days ago we came back up and retested the resistance
but we do have a a pretty strong candlestick on the four hourly
and this just might be when we see the market pull back down to, potentially zero point five hundred and seventy eight, potentially at the around the support at least
because this is the thing we're just we do have the trends on the lower time frames, but this is not the overall perspective
so when we trade in a sideways or when i trade in a sideways market, we should always think about, okay, where is the previous support? because, okay, to have even, okay, this the entry was really good, but that doesn't mean that the market will take to take profits
because we know that we just might only come back down to the support at zero point five hundred and ninety and then see the market push back up again
i mean, we already almost retested this resistance too, so i wouldn't do and i don't like how the way the candlesticks looks on the on on the third, on the lower time frames
but okay, well, if you see a pullback, or if i i, because i'm no financial advisor, we just, i just might see a recess around zero point six hundred and twelve and zero point six hundred and fourteen
but if i see, like a huge, you see the too much movement to the upside, that just might be the market, you know, come back up and reach us, maybe 0620 again, see more push or down
but this, this is based on the last lower high with the lower low
we actually were talking about b b this morning on this live stream
i know raj in the community, he gave us a screenshot of his short trade that he took of it, which is really great
so we, as i told you this morning, when we didn't have the live stream, um, i think it was, is it on the dog? so yeah, we were around, it must have been around, yeah
so what we waited for the market to do was to break, um, let's see
so we did expect the market to either come back up to 293 or 297
and right now this is where we um also can use the fib now, because market broke the support, we also try now to break the previous lower high at 288, high low
so right now i drag a fibonacci from 293 back down to the low at 288
and, uh, people not did i say the fibonacci levels? i don't know
so we just might see the pull back up to those levels for a retest, and then the drop
take profit two will be 284, and say, profit three will be 282
obviously, we can always, or i can always use other take profits too
so when we're looking at the left, we're trying to take our take profits at the at previous higher lows, or previous support and resistance zones, because that's when market will always come and read as previous support and resistance zones
so if you don't have, if you don't know how to take, take profits, you always look at the left
okay? so for example, uh, this, uh, this line right here, that's, uh, minus 023, if we just take a horizontal line
so you can see exactly how the fibonacci also works, um, when it comes to take profits
can you see how perfectly this is? you see how this take profit is at this low, retest, right? and think about it like a zone
okay? this one is really bad, but you could see the retest inside of it
so if you don't know, if you don't use the fibonacci, we can always look at the left and see where the previous lower low, uh, the previous support and resistance zones is
if you had, if you didn't know, when you say pull back and you're talking about an upward, higher target, it gets confusing
um, i don't know exactly what's com i don't quite understand, but i do apologize for that
uh, we did look at okay, so we're gonna look at ethereum, we had to look at ethereum, so this was also, uh, so if you, if you haven't looked at the video that i posted today, uh, this one was also about ethereum, so if we go to the lower time frames, let's see
so when i recorded the video, uh, was it? it was today, right? so if we were right here, so around this candlestick, this was where i i sold bitcoin market, came back up, retested, and then you saw the drop
as you see, can you understand why he's like, we need to be very careful when it comes we need to be very careful in a sideways market, because it doesn't look good at all right
it's really, it's really easy to lose money in this, in a chart like this, i, i think this is better like sculpting, because you cannot, we cannot expect the market to, you know, make big moves, because it's just going, you see, like the market comes to the support, comes to the middle of the range and then goes back
and this is just a very ugly, choppy, really ugly, ugly chart
so i'm actually, i don't even it looks better on bitcoin, but, i mean, take fib from 1820 back down to the low, but it's still really ugly
um, are you expecting a larger move for ethereum, it's running out of room
i just think, yes, i definitely believe that the market will do something soon
like on friday, for example, we do have a also, okay, so thursday we have a news coming out on usd um, we do
it is a orange box, so it can definitely affect the market a little bit
but on friday, we have some red news coming out, which means the market, uh, this could actually be where the market potentially have the push to whatever direction
um, but i definitely believe that we will see some movement soon, because the market has been going sideways, sideways for quite a while
please god, make that happen, because this chart is so boring
okay, i do believe, i do believe that we will also have it pushed to the downside
i just think the market is like, annoys everyone right now, and just waiting for the huge drop that we will have
don't forget, guys, that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars
great platform to trade on, especially if you are a swing trader
and i sold the market from thirty thousand five hundred and six to eight and and obviously, for myself too
i'm soon gonna move my stop loss into entry because, and potentially i just might move the stop loss up to higher targets
but, yeah, this is the platform where you can, where you can uh receive the bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars
descending triangle, uh, with entry from the upside, should continue down
but if we break on ethereum, if we break 1726, um, we will definitely come back down to to the wick
but if we start to see some big movements to the downside, what we're gonna do is that we're looking at the left and see, okay, to where can that next level be at? because remember that the market is always trading from level to level
so if you break one level, and for example, this is the level we're at right now, at 1750, you can see the week, the week, the week
so if we break one support, you will see the market, uh, pull back down to another support, because it needs to find a support usually
so if we break 1715, this is the next level we can see the ethereum pull back down to
and that was also something that i spoke about in today's short video that i did
if we would see the market pull back to the upside, if you just see one huge, big green candlestick, we first of all, will we come back up to this resistance at 2 000 and okay, so almost 2100 2017
so that's the first level we need if we would see bigger movements
but this is the first one that we need to if we can, if we close above one thousand nine hundred and ten, this would definitely be a push to the to the higher time frames level
but always remember that if if the market breaks one level, it will go to the next level
but when it's on the higher time frames, you will all obviously see bigger movements
i take so much time now on each coin, i um, that is also because i want to educate you at the same time, and myself
so this is a support, uh, looking at the daily chart, but it's the same thing
well, you can see that we do have different, uh, supports, right? so this was the last support that i would use
because you can from nowhere, like market can go straight up, and then market can go straight down
says, if you haven't already liked the live stream, if you haven't, you can go inside and do that
and if you want to learn more about what i do, you can go down to my crypto trading for beginners
and obviously the other, uh, previous videos that i have, but these ones are more educational, because the other videos, i show more about the price that's right now
you like, you have the best youtube right here, one of the best at least
so really, i'm very good at to explain in a very simple way how to do the charts
and guys, we have 133 people where seb seven me really wants to know where everyone's from
if anyone didn't, uh, if you didn't already know that, my name is natalie
i'm from sweden, and i want to know what country you're in right now
perth, australia, london, portuguese, but living in luxembourg
it's so amazing how it's so many people from all over the world that's here
we are in the other side of the world, connected by this beautiful community
is it very it's very nice to have so many people from all over the world
and if you want to be part of the community that, with coincidence, all bitcoin senses also have, you have the link to uh
that chat is a telegram community where we share our thoughts about cryptocurrencies or different do whatever you want to show
and we don't fight with each other, because everyone will have completely different, uh, ways of seeing the market
but some it just look a little bit different than i don't like it
how are how are ya? okay, so what we can do soon, because the market is really ugly
if you want to, if you want me to continue to have this live stream and we can do some back testing, put 333 in in the comments section
because i, i just do believe that on every period that we're looking at right now, it doesn't look that great, to be honest
so if you want me to do a back testing session, then tell me what you want me to go through
lauren, i'm not gonna analyze this one for you, because you can see, it's just, this does not look good at all
it's just that some people want to know prices, and that's why i don't want to look at it, because it's so choppy
so based on that, we can clearly see a pretty strong downtrend
so it kind of looks like we could, uh, pull back up to 936 or 1006 dollars
so when we're looking at the charts right now, they support trendline
okay, so we can come back down to eight point twelve dollars, or seven points and ninety six dollars too, if we say pull back, uh, back down
we can also use this previous little high, if we would see now that the market, yeah, okay, so we're trying to break this previous high
if that this is the case, you can see the market pull back down
if we break the resistance at the support trend line, it could actually be where you see the market continuing back down even more
guy, okay, so if you want me to do a bat, if we're gonna do a little back testing xrp, you tell me what you want me to go through, because we can do a short session about one technical tool while i'm analyzing xrp
um, you could see the market pull back down to zero point, thirty eight thousand four
and the resistance is at zero point, four thousand four hundred and fifty five
if we break the resistance, you can see the market pull back up to zero point for the fourth at 4 480 and 04 620
and if we break, if we would now see the market break the support instead, we could pull back down to zero point, three thousand five hundred and fifty
okay, so no one wrote anything about what you want me to backstage, so we just might not do the back testing right i'm playing smash like the butter with another preview
we just might pull back up to, uh, twelve thousand six hundred and eighty, and twelve thousand six hundred, and five thousand six hundred, twelve thousand seven hundred, if we see a bigger pullback, we test continue to back down, because the overall move, we broke the support trend line
we retested the sixty one point eight percent at twelve thousand seven hundred and twenty one
so if we see the drop from now, uh, we can drop back down to twelve point three hundred and thirty three at twelve, what did i say? twelve thousand three hundred and forty
twelve thousand and one hundred and, uh, eleven thousand eight hundred and eighty five
uh, card, okay, so we did look at cardono a couple of minutes ago, but we can look at cody because i don't want to go through, uh, i just enjoy replaying them, but it gives a nice perspective
so this is pretty good, um, to see cody screamed the market were supposed to pull back up
what happened? the market gave us one, two, three, four candlesticks that was, uh, above it
and then if we go down to the lower time frames, we came back down to support
so technically, what happened? market created lower high, lower low
so we're dragging fibonacci from zero point two thousand two hundred and twenty five back down to the support at zero points, 997, if we break
so this trend line that i have is based on the weekly trend line, so we can definitely break it, or just come back up and retest it and then see the market potentially drop
but if we would see the market breaking, just remember that we can pull back up to zero point one thousand six hundred and fifteen and zero point one thousand seven hundred and fifty five
and this is where we can actually see the market drop again, um, because the market created a lower low
and you can see on the higher time frames also that the market is creating small, high highs and higher lows
very, very, not such strong, uh, social and not such a strong marker structure
but you can see a little bit high highs and high lows, right? but the lower high is calculated, the real lower high is calculated by the previous lower high combined with the lower low
and that gives us the levels where the higher time frames lower high can be
and based on that, we are also breaking a trend line on the weekly chart, which is also very hard for, uh, the market to break
it wouldn't surprise me if we only had the retest than see the drop
okay, so, yeah, my, my short trade on bitcoin is from 30 568 right now
and while we're here, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
uh, sounds like a trap coming from yousef what shop? who else is playing? oh, i don't think i would ever want to play a game with you
and if you want, if you have, if you've never used by bit before, uh, you have also a link to a video and different bitcoin sensors
he's really good at explaining how to use the platforms um, okay, what else? okay, so yeah, you know what? we're gonna do some back testing
because i was celebrating you getting a new job a couple of days ago, i was like, everyone, think about seb, seb, blah, blah, blah
if you want to learn how to to look at the charts in an easy way
if you don't know who andy is, andy is also part of big consensus, and he's a really great youtuber
no, sorry, he's it, is a great youtuber, but very, very good at technical analysis too
if you haven't subscribed to him, you can also go inside and do that
but he had a live stream today, and i saw september, he was like, andy, what did you say? andy, is the leader of my heart
and then seb seb saw me on the chat and he was like, you're still my side chick? what? so andy, he get your heart
okay, what do we want to see? maybe we want to, ah, look at some just for the fun of it
we can look at something else, because back testing is really good
and we've been back testing bitcoin for so long, it's, i think it's really good
no, okay, so, but, um, yeah, i wouldn't, just because we're looking at it
and you can see, we can see the market potentially pull back down to the support again
dj, oh, what is this? it's a little bit more fun to back test um for experience, because they have more data then what bitcoin and all of the other pairs got
i'm telling you, when it comes to, like, technical, when it comes to the computers, the microphone, it's crazy
i'm gonna take the ones that you want me to analyze, because we're back testing either way, right? i'm just telling you exactly what i see
so if you want me to look at any other pair, tell me and i'll try to figure it out
it's also fun for me to to change charts a little bit, you know
okay, so looking at the threemonth chart, we are at the three monthly support
um, if we focus on what's happening here, overall, the market is in a downtrend
okay, so if we break, so i'm looking at the six monthly chart
and on the six monthly chart, this is a very huge time frame now, but this is only because i want to see the overall view, where we're going, or where we can change, where we potentially can head to
a six monthly supports at one point, five thousand three hundred and eighty
also, it's a zone, one point, uh, three thousand six hundred and forty eight
i think it's easier for us to go down to the three monthly chart now
and what we also, okay, so overall, what we're doing right here is also a sideways market
okay, so if we're looking at the higher time frames right now, um, so we're just gonna change it like this
now because i already, as you can see, while i was analyzing, put the trend lines, etc, etc, you kind of understand that i was just looking for the lower high, potentially
but when we, when we drag the fibonacci on the weekly chart, the most, the best thing, the other great confirmation that we have that this could be the lower high
um, bitcoin senses facts, elephants can hear nuts nails from really, we are retesting the lower, uh, the fifty percent, at one point seven thousand, seven thousand three hundred and fifty and one point eight thousand and thirty
and if we just dragged it to connect where we were in the market, you can see that this is a previous support and resistance zone
now, this is where we already start to see that the market is breaking the structure
and that is usually what happens before the market reverses the trend
and because we expect the market to be reversed from this level, and as i told you, we are in a sideways market, just the same way we're on the bitcoin, but your usd looks so much better when it comes to, when it comes to the to the charts
um, so we are in a sideways market right now, looking at the daily
we can, if we just take away, uh, the one clue, uh, one thing that is really important is that we use this last high
from this last high, you saw the push back down, right? so as long as we're not breaking above that high, because you can see the market pull back up to reach as one point seven thousand seven hundred and sixty, or at the high
but if the market will respect this level as a other lower high, you will see the market only come back after we test is very with, uh, very fast
so that could be where you then start to see the market break break down on the lower time frames
and if we drag now the fibonacci from the the push that we didn't have to the downside, from, uh, 17865, back to the lower low, that broke the whole trend
we could have used this one too, but technically this is the last, this is the real move
so this was the the the this is the lower low we need to connect the fibonacci with at 16392
and then you have fibonacci levels pretty combined with the 50 and at the 618 percent on this fibonacci
i just want to see, i mean, i quite don't like how it looks on the lower time frames
but so if we see the market, um, could give me a potential, because the market is creating a, either we're creating a a higher low and see the market push because, but we do expect the market to uh, break down here
but technically, this is a, i would never sell the market at this level
so either i would want to see a push back up to a, 17 200, 273
uh, see the retest against this level, and that could be a, for me, a position to sell the market
but if i also would see the market break below 07 082 and potential retest, that could also be the, uh, another entry for me
but i definitely would want to see the market reach this level and we see that we're closing below the previous high
so, yeah, that's what i see right now when it comes to euro usd
some say not only were glasses to look more intelligently, or is that even a word? thank you
but it's definitely something we swedish people would say, because we put that, we use our words in a different way
i have a good friend of mine that's american, and he's and he tells me all of the wrongs that i say when it comes to english
i say, having and he said that you're you cannot say happened to everything you're supposed to say, have
so if anyone finds that annoying, well, try to speak swedish now
well, you know, okay, looking at bra, uh, it doesn't look good, i would say
um, looking at the lower time frames, you just going sideways, baby, you're just going sideways
okay, so if we break below the support, if we're looking at the daily we have the support right here with where all the billions of numbers is
if we break this support at six, three, zero, two, seven, six, next level is the week and five, two, seven, five, six, six
if we see a bigger momentum, or not a bigger momentum, but this is also a level at seven, nine, seven, four, three, two
if you break this high, we can pull back up to nine, three, eight, four, zero, seven

everything is about you, okay? you're not selfish for taking care of yourself first, because that's how we can share love with other peoples, by having the love within yourself first
while i was recording this video, i used this previous resistance that we have in the middle of the range market
we created a potential lower high going down to the lower time frames
retested the fibonacci levels that i also combined with this previous resistance, i got three different targets on bitcoin and also on ethereum, don't forget that i'm no financial advisor
you need to look up everything yourself first, because i only share what i see on the charts, nothing more than that
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you step by step why i took this trade on bitcoin
okay, going to the daily right away, because we need to identify what type of market we're in
and we are in a sideways market, which is very important for us to understand, because it is from the resistance you see all of the fake outs
and by understanding that we are not being faked out, which is really good
so we have a resistance that is around 31 340, and we also have a support that is around twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty
so yesterday we did close with an inverted hammer, or hanging man
if you wanna be precisely, i definitely believe that we can push back down on the lower time frames
this is exactly what we will go into on the on today's live stream, morning live stream
i told you that i didn't know exactly, uh, what to do at the moment
and sometimes that is just totally fine, that you don't even know what you're looking at
and that's when you're just that stepping out of the charts and you just wait for the market to do whatever
so now this technically is also way, no, sorry, a supply zone, supply zone, supply zone
and we did close with this candlestick below against this previous lower high
this is also a lower high, because you can even if we are in a sideways market, they are br they are below each other
we are in a sideways market, as you can see, sometimes we don't go from the resistance back down to the support or all the way
but this is why it's really important to understand a sideways market, because you can see that you never know exactly if we will come back down to the support as you saw right here, market never came back down
so a lot of people would sold the market and expect the market
and i was actually one of them, and i thought the market was supposed to go down even more
and a lot of people, even me, because with this huge candlestick, i was like, no, definitely, the market is pulling back down to the support before we're reaching the the resistance again
but we all, we just came back down around, uh 50 of this range market, and then you saw the market push back up
so that is why it's really important, as i told you, to understand what type of market we're in
because when we, when we are in a sideways market, you have different support and resistance zones, right? you have one sport here, you have one support here
and to see where we are right now at the market, we are retesting this previous resistance
i'm gonna go if we want to see the market actually going down and we don't want to be faked out from it
and we are retesting this previous resistance as we were looking at the four hourly charts
and based on that, it looks like we can actually continue back down, because you can see the marking
and now we could potentially see another lower high now being created
even if we are inside the range market, we can, i can still trade the market inside of it, as long as i know my level
so we go down to the one hourly chart, and this doesn't look so good
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna adjust the resistance against the high at thirty thousand five hundred and ninety
i still believe that the market will continue back down, but that is only because on the previous day we had this inverted hammer
if we see that the market is closing below 35, 30, 520, this can actually be where we see the market giving us a resistance again, and then see the drop
so what we're looking at right now could be a potential fake out from this resistance
if we drag a fibonacci from the lower high, that is from 31 385, back down to the support at 29 980
this is also exactly where bitcoin came up and retested the fibonacci levels at 30 843
what we also can do is that, based on this, uh, break that we had to the downside
you know, as as always, what i do is that i take the fibonacci, sorry, i take the trend line, just to identify the break of structure right here
but we are using this previous high, and we combine it with the low
we can also drag it back down so it fits exactly to the bodice of the candlestick
and you can see that, as usually, what i do in different ways
you can either take the fibonacci from this high to this low, and this was something that i did a couple of days ago when we saw the market are, we did have a morning livestream about this, so i saw the market from this level back down
but now we can still use the last high with the lower low that was created because this technically, with this huge move
and the market does what? the market comes up and retest did 50 and 618 percent of this whole move that we did have
so market comes back up right now, retest it, and then if we break below the support, uh, the previous resistance, and we'll turn it into a new resistance
and you can also see that, based on this fibonacci, you're also combined with that, we're slightly below the support
take profit two is 28 670, and take profit three is twenty seven thousand nine hundred and fifty
because, as you already know from before, is that i still believe that we will come back down
i've said it so many times, and i still believe that we need to come back down to 25 200 to fill this week that we did have, and then whatever happens
but i do not know, but i definitely believe that we need to come back down here and fill this week, and then slowly and steady see the market long term, we will break to the upside
but this is the this is the move that i'm looking for at the moment
and while i'm recording this video, i obviously took the trade because i definitely believe that we will continue back down
i just sold the market on market execution, and i have my take profit at twenty eight thousand six hundred and sixty
and i have my stop loss slightly above this previous high, that would uh at thirty one thousand and fifteen
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus through bitcoin sentence and me, up to four thousand and fifty dollars on by bit
and for example, if it takes one day for the market, or two days for the market to reach my level, during these days, the market or by will give me very low fees
obviously, i also believe that we will pull back down from this level
we were talking about this um consolidation market in the morning live stream too
another thing that we can do is that we drag the fibonacci from this high at thousand eight hundred and forty four, back down to the low at one thousand seven hundred and seventy six
we go down to the lower time frames, and we can see how perfectly the market came back up and retested this zero point six to one point eight percent
and if the market now will continue back down, take profit one will be one thousand seven hundred and sixty
take profit two will be one thousand seven hundred and twenty six, and take profit three will be one thousand six hundred and ninety four
remember that when we if we now see the market pulling back down, either if it is to the upside or to the downside, one very important thing that we have to have in mind, because we don't want to lose money when it comes to the charts
but when you see the market coming back down to a preview support like this, usually what the market is doing is giving us the fake outs
you see the market try to break the level, and then you see the market close inside the supporter or the resistance zone, again, give it as a retest, and then you see the market continues to maybe to the middle of the range or to the resistance
you see the market slowly setting, pulling back down and close below the resistance
see the see the retest again, and then see the market drop either to half of the range or back down to the support
this this is why it's really important for us to understand that and always check that first
because, you know, even if the market is in heavily downtrend, in a sideways market, it's easier to trust the market when you're when you're having the trend
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
hit the notifications so you know when i am live next time, or when i do have my daily updates
maybe you can see that after this video, i'm going for some workouts
so we see each other in today's live stream that i will have a couple of hours after this video, not for sweden
i'm just gonna give the rest the content, but the computer is also waking up right now
okay, guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so we can reach out to the left, to the rest of the youtube world, right? so we can help other people to find my channel, so we can let them see the charts in an easy way
we can start off with because i knew okay, we do have some usd uh, new news coming out today
if you're looking at forest factory, uh, we only have yellow, yellow boxes
so i don't think the market will be super volatile, at least it will not change the direction in the market
and on friday, i know that we were supposed to have some, okay, we do have some news coming out friday, uh, 2 30 pm also
so we can expect the market to be a little bit volatile, but usually that's what happens also during fridays
overall, i'm gonna take this one away because we're still trying to break this previous support, this previous support that we did break
how are you? we've been so i'm looking at the higher perspective when it comes to dxi, to dollars um, just for me to understand the whole move
it's always so much easier to look at the higher perspective because that is just giving you the overall view of what's happening
and then when we go down to the lower time frames, that's when we start to really um analyze on the lower time frames
but the higher perspective is always giving us the the overall view
so what we are inside right now? if you're looking at the monthly it's a pretty huge box
but what i did highlight was this green candlestick that we did have a december month, uh, on dxi 2016
so from this level, you also saw the market reach this level, uh, march 20
quick retest, and then now market is inside of, inside of this supply zone
but, okay, so we did come back down a couple of days ago, a week, two weeks ago, we came back down and retested the 50 around 101360
how are you? and we did retest, as i told you, we did retest the 50
we came back down for a higher low because we broke the downtrend, right? but the only thing that i that i do have in mind now is this previous as i told you
but first, um, we were, we started off by talking about the support, but i just needed to go to the higher perspective to see what's actually happening
and now we know that we are inside a six monthly supply zone, um, even if it's a pretty huge uh zone
but definitely, if we come back up now, only to retest this previous support as a new resistance, because we just might have to pull back down to 100, point, 600 for the market to have a real higher low, and then slowly instead, to see the market pull back up
another thing that we're going to do is that we will drag a fibonacci from 103800, hello lauren, and 80, back down to 101358
and this is where, technically, this uptrend that we did have, this option that we did have, got broken, and we broke the higher law, and that is the one that we're retesting right now
so this is very important for us to understand, is that this is the impulsive move
so the pullback on the higher time frames might not just be done yet
and especially now when you start to see that we came back up and retested at 50, we're still creating high lows, right? but this is what we're gonna do in case we see the market break this level to the downside, because it actually looks like we can do that
i mean, you cannot trade dollars, but that, this is why i i love to analyze it, because looking at the b at the bitcoin chart and all of the other uh pairs against usd is really good
but if we see a break of structure here, now, this could be where we pull back down again to 101360, potentially, uh, 100 600
and from these levels, this is where the the pullback will end, and the next high and the next impulsive move on dollars could potentially be created
so if we see that the market now is pushing back down on on dxi, when we go to bitcoin, bitcoin is in a sideways market
so for the people who wonders why bitcoin is behaving strange, it's because you are inside a sideway, a sideways market
so the market just, you know, do whatever it's supposed to do, right? so that is why it's really important for us to understand what type of market we're in
overall, we are in a downtrend, but the market is not con is not consolidating between support and resistance
and when it comes to support and resistance zones, and especially on the higher time frames, we don't actually know
you can because you can see, i highlighted the at the sideways market, but you see, the market doesn't come back up to the support or the trend line every time
you only have a few touches that actually touches the whole, uh, the resistance or the support
but just like yesterday, from this resistance, we think that we will come back down to the support
um, we also had an averted, or hanging man closed, uh, yesterday
so for the market to be better, for the market to be bullish, sorry, bearish, right now, makes sense
so the end of the week is at 2 29 100 and one hundred, twenty nine thousand one hundred and fifty go down to the lower time frames
you know, it's, i don't think i'm gonna do anything right now on on bitcoin, to be honest
i'm actually gonna wait by just looking at how the market is looking
i don't like to i don't like the way the market is looking at the moment
and this is the thing, sometimes the market doesn't look good
and that is also very good for us to understand, that sometimes we just need to leave the charts alone
i'm not going to push anything just because i want to, want to have it analyze for you guys
now, it's another thing when you come up to the resistance or to the support, because that's when you see if we can have a beginning to the upside, or, uh, to the downside
but when we're looking at a a sideways market, and we are in, we are in the middle of the range so many you can definitely see the market pull back down and then see the pull back up
okay, so when we're looking at ethereum, it looks better, but we still have the indecision candle
um, if we just drag down, oh, this is a previous resistance also
okay, so when we're looking at the two weekly chart, i think i did this also yesterday, so i'm highlighting the previous support that we did break
and then on the lower time frames, what i'm gonna do is that i'm just gonna try to make it a little bit prettier
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna take this box right here, because now i know i don't have to drag the the box to to the to the left, because this is where the focus is
we had to break out and fake out, then broke the other break out
i was trying to point it out to you a few weeks ago when i noticed the trend
it's only because i didn't, i didn't look at it again because in my head, i was, i already kind of knew
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that, because i go through cryptocurrencies every single day, and i am really good at the technical so if you are not so good at a technical you are at the right place
and if you also want to be part of the consensus community together with me also, and want to have a direct contact with me, you will have the link in the description

i'm so happy to hear that we got one, one, one people, 111 people watching this live stream right now
let us talk to the angels and tell them that everything that we want and what we desire, we can have
philip um, so yeah, looking at the sideways market, we can just make it a little bit better
um, to be honest, i'm not gonna give you anything on ethereum either because i don't like it
i'm not gonna just give you something just because, just because that's not good
that is not, that's not how you can, even though i'm no financial advisor, but that's not how you can trust someone, by just giving you something when they see, if we don't see anything
and that's sometimes it is what it is, right? so we can go to the monthly chart
previous month, we have a zone right here that we almost came back down and retested
so cannot look at it, you know, if there's, like, if you're working for a company, looks like crack today
i i remember a couple of weeks ago, i i told everyone i don't like trading nas i hate it
when we broke the previous higher low, created a lower high against the higher loan
market pulls back down, now comes back up, and does what? retesting a previous high low
so we're also in a sideways market on the 12 hourly when it comes to nas and [Music], if we were looking at the two weekly charts, it looks like we can pull back up to thirteen thousand two hundred and ninety two and thirteen thousand six hundred and thirty for the market to reach these levels
so from the last high to the lower low, and we cannot cut any candles, remember? so for us to come back up and retest the higher time frames, fibonacci, that is also combined with the trend line, which the market usually don't have the power to break
so market comes back up here, and then we can see the market pull back down again
and on the lower time frame, then what we do okay, we identify that we are in a sideways market at the moment, right? we can, we could come back down to one thousand, twelve thousand three hundred and fifty six, and twelve thousand two hundred and twenty five, and then see, and that is also combined with the previous lower high right here, as you can see, because if we're looking at the higher time frames, we broke the trend, so we broke the downtrend
now, when we broke the previous lower high, which is around this level, broke it, retested it as a support
so it actually looks like we're pretty, we are a little bit bullish right now
i'm not gonna lie, yesterday i was in some self positions, um, but i closed them because i saw the market were not supposed to go down anymore
okay, so we could take a fibonacci from twelve thousand four hundred and thirty three back up to twelve thousand seven hundred and eight
so we could see the market pull back down to, uh, twelve thousand five hundred and seventy or twelve thousand five hundred and thirty eight
from these levels, this could be where we see the the beginning of the pullback, the bigger pullback that we just might need
but if we go down to the lower timeframes on the 15 minutes chart, what we also can do is that would drag the fibonacci back up to, uh, twelve thousand five hundred eighty five
can you see how the market came back down yesterday's? so this is why it's really important that we analyze, i try to analyze the chart in a in the right way, kind of because i didn't see this yesterday
now we're on the 15 we've been going from the monthly to the weekly, to the two weekly, to the daily, to the two daily for our etc
and now we see where we could potentially buy the market from
can you see how important it is to take the higher time frames and just scale it down? because you see, you see with your own eyes how important it is, right? so what i am waiting for right now, obviously, is to see if this will act
so if i would have bought the market, i have, would, i should have bought the market around 12 647
but i don't want to, i don't want to do anything yet, because what could happen is that you can obviously come back up and retest the trend line again, and then see the pull back down
so either i will wait for the market to pull back down again to create a higher low inside here, or i'm waiting for nas to break the trend, and at that time, i will take another fibonacci from the low to the to the break to the higher high, and that gives me the higher low, potentially
and the same thing is that if we expect the dollars to go down, which it looks like it does, and we also need to fill these gaps, so the market will pull back down, it actually looks like that
so for and dxi, if we expect the bigger drop, can you see? okay, we're looking at the four hourly
but it's not so if we did expect the bigger pullback to the downside, can you see how good it looks when we combine it with nas? it just connects so good with the charter where your shut up circling so good with each other
it looks beautiful, right? so, yeah, that's what i see right now on nos
and it looks like we're, we're actually having some momentum right now
how are you? lauren? you don't know who that aha, you don't know who that is? well, that's good
going to use third and then we're just doing the same thing, because use 30 is also one of the pairs that i train
so go to the higher time frames first of all, just to see, oh yeah
well, technically on the monthly chart, the higher low hasn't been broken yet
so when we're looking at us 30 um the monthly chart, i still believe that we will come back down
but the technically, the higher low hasn't been broken when it comes to the higher time frames perspective
um, [Music], if we drag fibonacci on the higher time frames from 26 574 back up to 36 415, the higher low, the last higher low, was technically 26 574
um, so we can still pull back down to these levels and still be any uptrend, even though it looks pretty scary right now, right because we had so many months the market just went straight up, and now we need a bigger pullback
we are looking at us 30, and we're coming back up to retest the weekly resistance trendline
the same thing on bitcoin and ethereum, but another important thing is that on the weekly, this is where the was that the right one? there's no wonder the market is consolidating right now, because we are inside or slightly below the weekly fibonacci
so she's getting married in the chat, and she's both looking at the charts
okay? so if we from nowhere, would see a break of this last high low, i will start to look at cell positions on on us 30
maybe you see something that i do not see, but i don't like the way the charts looking
and to be honest, okay, so if we break above this resistance trend line, we can pull back up to 33 493
everything depends on how can you see the market does have the trouble to break it, you know? but we are below the fibonacci to the downside
either we will break the resistance trendline, and that could give me an opportunity to buy the market, to hire targets the same thing that that we were looking at nas
but if we break the support, sorry, i go back and forth on my chart, but if we break the support trend line, this could be where it would potentially see the beginning for the market to go back down
because that is, it's because this is the weekly but the already retested the 60 618 percent one time
and now, yeah, we just have to wait and see what's going to happen
but i guess everyone loves that, because that's why we're here
i do these morning live streams every single morning from monday to friday
so we can have exactly what you saw right now, the overview of what can happen during the day
because when we're looking at the charts now, we are so ahead of time than everyone else that's looking at the charts later, right? um, and that's why it's really good, uh, going on before the london session really opens
um, i guess fed's announcing inflation rate on friday will uh, determinate our path
if it's not like corona when it happened in the beginning of a couple of years ago, when you see a crash
it will only give us some fake outs and try to fake people out, but i don't think it will change a direction in the market
so if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that
if you haven't already checked my youtube page out, you should do it
if you're new in trading, you should look for a look at crypto beginners
uh, with crypto trading for beginners, these ones is really good
and especially if you want to learn how to trade the market, uh, and see the market for what it is
if you want some back testing help, you got back test, uh, with me
this is how i go through the charts and telling i just started the charts to play in demand zone, trend lines, etc
um, so, yeah, if you haven't already subscribed to it, you do it
you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the link in description down below the video, or linked in the chat
okay, start over looking at the higher perspective monthly chart
this wick that i highlighted can definitely be somewhere you can expect the market to come to
if we would see a pullback, we can also use this previous resist support just might turn into a resistance
okay, so this fibonacci that we didn't have on the daily was already retested
so i cannot just tell you guys that, yeah, the market will be bullish from here, because it makes no sense
they pull back high highs and higher lows to the higher time frames fibonacci, where the lower high was expected, the market created the lower high
and market slowly and steady, you can see how the low the high, the lower high, lower high
so we're waiting for this could be a lower high, but usually you can see you saw a lower high, a lower high
so this is like, oh, is this a uh high high? technically no, because you can see so many different high highs and higher lows on each time
but if we taking the help of the previous uh high with the lower low, could you see the market came up exactly to this fibonacci level? we take that one away, so we're dragging fibonacci from the last lower high to the lower low
and then now what we're gonna do is that we use the previous lower high with the lower low
but we can definitely see the market pull back up to 297 for then see the drop
so if that is the case, that the market will res on b b, that we will respect 297
also, we just might see the market come back up and retest the trend line that is connected with the lower highs
um, take profit 1 270, take profit to 250 and take profit 3 237
remembered looking something like that, and just adjust it so it looks great
so we're gonna highlight consolidation because this is where the market is bouncing in between
if we break the resistance, uh, zero point for the 2060, we can still come back up to zero point, four to four thousand, sorry, four thousand four hundred seventy four and zero point, four thousand six, twenty 4627
if that is the case, if this is where we see the market giving us um uh, a lower high
but we can also do this, if we see bigger pullback, we're just going to change the fibonacci and we drag it from 06438, still the same low
if that is the case, we can also reach 05 thousand one hundred and forty or zero point five thousand four hundred and forty two, still looking for the market to drop from these levels
first, um, first of all, we need to break the first of all, we need to break the resistance
if we want to see a bigger pullback, or if we just might see the market break to support continuation, until the market decides to what direction it will, you know, break, you just, you will just continue to see the market bounce in between the support and resistance
this will not continue forever, but it's always very good to have that in mind
but if we break the resistance, remember that we can come back up, and we test the 618 percent and the 50 and then see the market reverse
that is only the market breaking the resistance for it to reach the fibonacci levels to then potentially see the market drop
i remember i said you, you were the one, the first one who said anything, paul, i apologize
it's so refreshing to just start over when you have so many things on the charts
would you want to have a back testing session to me with me today, later tonight, maybe, maybe go through the charts together? have a live stream, obviously, and go through the charts
but do we have a celebrity here? where's the celebrity? i'm just joking
then, uh, someone said, hi, let you know, someone from discord reached out selling a pro trader deal
the only thing, the only way you will be able to contact me is through youtube or the telegram group
that is, that is, i mean, that is, actually, we cannot do more than just say it's not us and try to take them away
but believe me when i say we will never ask you for money or give you a deal or anything
now, what the you never got the money i sent you? no, we broke
okay, so we came back up now, and we did retest the fibonacci at 118
so what we can do now is that we'll drag another fibonacci from 111 back down to, uh, 96
if that is the case, take profit one, i'm no financial advisor, but take probably one is ninety three dollars
take profit two is eight to five dollars, and take profit three is seven to eight dollars
but that is only, remember, that is only if the market is giving us a bearish reversals around these levels
i don't wanna look at the charts right now, because i gotta go
i gotta go because i'm gonna do some content for twitter and tiktok, for beautiful bitcoin census

so if you hear a swedish girl going crazy on birds, you know why, and you know exactly who it is
well, i'm so happy for that sleeping golden thank you so much
my name is josh, and in just a moment, i'll be comparing previous bitcoin bottoms so that we can see what sort of price action plays out when the bitcoin price has bottomed out
and of course, later in this video, i'll be covering the ethereum price action and the stock markets
first of all, just taking a quick look at the twoday bitcoin chart
and obviously, we still have this active bullish divergence in play
and what is great to see about this bullish divergence is the fact that we're still seeing a fairly strong uptrend in a twoday bitcoin rsi
and the last time when we saw a similar uptrend in the rsi on the daily timeframe, the twoday timeframe, that was back around february and march
but during that time period, we didn't have a bullish divergence here on the twoday bitcoin chart
but even without a bullish divergence, just because of the fact that we were oversold in the twoday bitcoin rsi, and we're seeing a fairly strong recovery in the rsi on the daily time frames, that basically meant that the bitcoin price was due to hold up relatively well
and obviously, that did indeed happen between around january and march
and looking at the last time where we saw a significant uptrend here in the twoday bitcoin rsi, that was during the middle of last year
and during that time period, obviously, we'll see a bullish divergence
because, in fact, up until just a few days ago, recently, the bitcoin price over the past few weeks, was almost perfectly repeating what we saw in the middle of last year
and you can see this more closely if you copy that price action and overlay it on top of the recent bitcoin price action
and once again, just up until a few days ago, we saw a very high correlation between what we've seen recently and what we saw in the middle of last year
and once again, just over the past few days, we have seen a slight divergence away from this fractal but for the most part, we're still playing out a lot of choppy sideways press action, which is pretty much what happened in the middle of last year
even though we did slightly change to the downside, we didn't exactly break much lower than the original low, because we originally bottomed out at around 30 000 during may last year
and we only formed one more slightly lower low, which was just below 29 000
and obviously, if you've been subscribed to this channel over the past couple weeks, you would already know about this fractal just here, because i have mentioned it quite a lot here on the channel
so i won't be going too much into this particular fractal in this video, but just really quickly explaining what this fractal suggests
it does indeed suggest mostly choppy, sideways price action, with the possibility of a bit more of a pullback within the next couple weeks or so
but it is important to mention i do not use fractals as an exact price prediction, instead as more of a rough guideline for what we could expect moving forward, based on previous price action
and now, with that in mind, if you copy the 2018 bear market bottom and overlay that price action on top of the recent bitcoin price action, this is what we get
so obviously, once again, if you've been keeping up to date with my recent videos here on the channel, or if you've been in crypto for any longer than just a few weeks, you will know that the 2018 bear market bottom was a very significant bottom for bitcoin
and during that time in the market, at the end of 2018, entering into early 2019, as bitcoin was bottoming out, this is basically what we saw going into the bitcoin bottom, we saw a massive capitulation, almost a vertical drop in the bitcoin price
and then after the bitcoin price bottoms out for the 2018 bear markets, we saw a lot of choppy, sideways price action for a couple more months, before then we saw more of a bullish reversal back to the upside, which was actually over a 300 pump in early 2019
and even in this 2018 fractal, this is still suggesting a possible pullback for the bitcoin price sometime within the next couple weeks or so
but for the most part, a lot of choppy, sideways price action before we see any sort of bullish reversal, potentially later on
and obviously, the 2018 bear market bottom was different to what we saw in the middle of last year
but once again, that goes back to why i don't use these fractals as exact bitcoin price predictions, instead, as more of a rough guideline for what we could expect moving forward
and when you're looking at these previous bitcoin bottoms, it just goes to show that we don't see a massive crash and then another immediate bullish recovery in a lot of significant bottoms
yes, we usually see a fast crash or some sort of capitulation
but then, in most cases, we usually see a lot of sideways, choppy price action, before then we enter into more of a bullish recovery later on, potentially months after that crashed the downside
and one reason that supports the idea of the bitcoin price potentially already reaching some sort of bottom, or very close to a bottom, is the fact that we've seen a massive spike in the volume indicator here on the weekly bitcoin charts
and i won't be going too much into detail about all of this in this video, because i've discussed it in further detail in previous bitcoin update videos
but basically, any time when we see a major bitcoin capitulation, just a very fast crash in the bitcoin price, we see a lot of bitcoin change hands, usually from a lot of panic sellers or a lot of people getting liquidated from their leveraged positions
and then a lot of that bitcoin flows into strong hands or longterm bitcoin holders, or whales
and if you're looking at the last complete bitcoin cycle over the last four to five years, whether we're looking at a bear market, a bull market or something in between, every significant bitcoin bottom so far during this entire time period has been confirmed when we see a massive spike in volume
and in the march 2020, example, when we saw that spike in volume and that one massive red weekly candle that confirmed the bitcoin bottom
but if you're looking at the 2018 bear market and what we saw in the middle of last year, what is very interesting is we actually put in a slightly lower low after we saw that massive spike in volume for bitcoin
so in the 2018 bear market bottom, when we saw that massive spike in volume after that huge capitulation, at that stage, the bitcoin price had reached a bottom of around 3 400, approximately
so we had a little bit lower to go, even though we had already seen a massive spike in volume
once again, we saw a massive spike in volume on that original capitulation to the downside during may last year
but we still ended up forming one more slightly lower low at just underneath 29 000 during june last year
and before jumping into the short term bitcoin price action, taking a look at the bitcoin news today, which is the fact that paypal is now giving the ability to its users to transfer crypto in and out of paypal
because before this, all you could really do with paypal around crypto is just buy and sell it on paypal, and he couldn't really withdraw it off paypal
and with this new update, you can now transfer certain coins into paypal and of course, withdraw coins out of paypal into just about any external crypto address, whether that's another exchange or into a hardware wallet or something like that
and the reason why this is good news is because of a couple different reasons
first of all, owning bitcoin, or pretty much any crypto for that matter, on a platform that does not support withdrawals is honestly not a good thing to do, because obviously, in that case, he basically trapped in
and in order to take your money out, you basically have to sell that crypto
and so with this recent news, paypal is going from a platform that could give you a little bit of crypto exposure just by buying it and then selling it later on, to now being a little bit more like one of the other crypto exchanges, where you can just buy and withdraw it from the exchange
because paypal reportedly has almost 400 million active users
and to put that into perspective, there's not a single crypto exchange that currently has over 100 million users, let alone nearly 400 million active users
and on top of that, with this recent update, paypal has also been granted a full bid license by the new york department of financial services, becoming the first company to convert a conditional bit license into a full bit license
because obviously there's a lot of people that have been scared about the us
it shows the us, or more specifically, the new york department of financial services, is actually opening up to bitcoin and crypto altogether by allowing paypal to do this, especially in the us
and now jumping into the shortterm bitcoin price action here on the fourhour time frame
and obviously, over the past few days, we've seen a lot of fakeouts above this line of resistance coming into play at around 30 700
which means that line of resistance has essentially lost some of its significance
but as for the lines of support, they have not changed for a while now
obviously, we still have some shortterm support at around 29 and a half thousand, but we have more significant support coming into play at around 28 and a half thousand
and technically speaking, 30 700 could still act as a bit of shorts and resistance
but on top of that, i'm looking towards this descending line of resistance coming into play at around 31 and a half thousand
and anything above that, i'll be looking towards this previous high, which is sitting at around 32 and a half thousand, as i mentioned in yesterday's video
and in terms of expecting a lot more bullish or bearish price action, i would not be expecting any of that until we either break above 32 and a half thousand to see more bullish price action, obviously, or break back below 28 and a half thousand in order to see more bearish price action to play out
and one of the main reasons that is potentially behind a lot of the choppy price action for bitcoin is due to the fact that we're seeing something very similar over in the stock market
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and basically over the past one to two weeks, we've seen a lot of choppy, sideways price action in the stock market
but i would expect a lot of this choppy, sideways price action to end towards the end of this week, entering into next week
because this friday, on the 10th of june, we have new cpi data that will be released, which will update the official inflation rate of the us
and usually it's around these sort of days where we see a lot more volatility in the market, which could happen on friday, but most likely entering into next week in particular
here on the daily time frame, obviously we still have this active bullish divergence in play, which is revealing reduced bearish momentum for ethereum
and looking at the shorter term here on the six hour time frame, technically we're still forming this symmetrical triangle pattern, with supports coming into play at around 1740 and resistance coming into play at just above 1900, more specifically, at around 1910
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum short positions on the bifinix exchange here on the daily timeframe
and today is basically the same story as what we've seen over the past week or so, which is a continued decline in the ethereum short positions on this particular exchange
and this chart is actually getting very close to all time low levels
and if you want to know more about what this means for ethereum, check out my last video here on the channel
and now giving you a quick update on the ethereum versus bitcoin chart here on the daily time frame
and over the past two days, we've seen a slight decline for ethereum versus bitcoin, which has slightly invalidated a previous bullish divergence between these two lows
but technically speaking, we're still seeing lower lows in the price action for the daily candle closes, but higher lows in the daily rsi, which is technically still a bullish divergence forming right now
but we need to reconfirm this bullish divergence by confirming this daily kennel close in the green, which would actually confirm this higher low in the rsi
and if that confirms then, once again, as i've been mentioning recently on the channel, i expect reduced bearish momentum for ethereum versus bitcoin
but with that being said, it's still important to understand that we're still in a fairly strong downtrend, even though we might be due for some shortterm reduced bearish momentum
so overall, in terms of the larger trend for ethereum, for spitcoin, obviously i'm leaning more bearish than bullish
and as for the bitcoin dominance, i am leaning more bullish than bearish, which is not really good for the altercoin markets compared to bitcoin
but obviously, this is nothing new for the subscribes out there, because i've been mentioning this basically every day on the channel over the past month
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to maximize your profits in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
for those of you that managed to get into your short trades, congratulations
i only managed to get about 10 percent of my positions entered
and we'll take a look at those charts that i had yesterday as well, and i'll update you on everything there
you can see that it's becoming weaker and weaker, right? so we didn't even make it to that, uh, diagonal that's trending down over there
we managed to, uh, price managed to only make it to 31 706 before turning
so when you look in relation to the charity on the left with the yellow circle, that is, once again, yet another lower high
so broken back down into the range, we have that key horizontal, which has been an important level throughout
and now we're having a look to see what price does within this zone
is it going to manage to hold this level or not? well, like i mentioned before, you have to think of it as if you have a thin layer of ice with a ball, and every time you bounce it, and you continue to bounce it onto that level, eventually it is going to snap and break through
so if that happens, you're gonna have to look out for something like this
let me just grab the i would recommend watching for, uh, price action like this
so if price manages to come down and it breaks below that range, the main range that it's that's been there, and it starts to consolidate like that, and then retest that area over there as a resistance
and when i say that area, i'm talking about 28 687, for those of you that may want to write it down, then that would activate my short signal, and i would start to target much lower prices
i would think that if it does manage to get to these lows, there is a possibility that it could bounce, but that is probably on the lesser, uh, less likely side
most likely, it's going to break that level down, and then we're going down to, i believe, 21 to 23 000
i did mention this in the newsletter today, which is why you'll see these additional drawings over here
i said that i'd be looking to enter within that yellow territory over there, the yellow circle
and i would get more aggressive as i get closer to the top there
now someone actually asked me, well, what do i mean by getting more aggressive? what exactly does that mean? what i mean by that is i would increase my position size
so if i entered 10 percent over here, maybe another 10 over there, 50 here
and then i'd enter the remainder of the position right before my invalidation level, which was coming in that zone over there
you need to decide how you wish to scale in when it comes to positions like that
and now i've outlined two potential options of what may happen next
so i've said that i see it, and this is not a guarantee, it's just the way that i'm watching the market
there is a possibility that price turns over and follows this pattern over here, which is, uh, outlined with the number one
and what i would look for is losing this key horizontal level at 1725, priced to also sort of consolidate underneath that level
i'd move it on to something like a 30 minute or one hour chart, see our price reacts over there
if it starts wicking into that key horizontal and price sells off, the candle goes down, wicks into it, comes down again, then i would say, well, look, this is looking to me like it's flipping that key horizontal area into back into a resistance zone
and you can also um sort of cross reference that and see what bitcoin is doing
if bitcoin's showing similar signs, then you can say, well, it looks like that's the route that it's taking
enter my shorts over there, uh? or increase my short position, because i already am in a short position, and then place my stops slightly above there, and then watch if price goes back down
if this fails, then i would look for, potentially, maybe it will come back down here again, bounce and then go up and follow pattern two
so if it does that, i'd be looking again to, uh, add more to my short position within the number two area over here, as long as it's lower than, uh, the price action on the left
as long as price can um stays below that zone over there, i'll load up on my shorts with a stop loss slightly above that
so following along with this pattern too would then turn into a similar setup to what you're seeing with pattern one
but the difference is you would already be shorting from the top over there
i also got about ten percent entered on this, uh, because sheldon decided he was gonna do solana for his show
so i know the community front ran him a little bit, and that's probably why i didn't quite make it into the yellow there
so when i saw the deviation happen, and for those of you that don't know, deviation is when price moves up above a key area and then starts to come back down over there, that is your deviation
when i saw the deviation, i entered my short trade over there
this is what's in the newsletter, and this is just something that i found interesting
this is not not a trade that you'd necessarily act on yet, per se, but nevertheless, it's worth having a look at
so i believe that bnb is possibly being looked at again as a security
and what you'll find is bnb is actually only down about 59 from alltime highs
where if you have a look on coin gecko or coin market cap, you'll find that the majority of altcoins are already down 80
now what i did is typically or use this kind of a curved chart or parabola in a extreme bull market to kind of track momentum
and you'll see that when this starts to get angled near a 90 degree angle, so price is moving straight up, then you can expect very, very aggressive price action, but it won't last for very long
so i did an inverse parabola, and you can see how it's reacting on this level
it's been bouncing off of there, and price has been selling off
now we're starting to approach those levels of, call it, 80 to 90 degree angles on that parabola
and i also marked that out with the key areas of liquidity, which is coming in over here at 140 dollars
you can see, similar to ethereum, price has wicked into this area multiple times
so, uh, the the more times that it hits again, it's that analogy of thin ice, eventually it is going to break through
so this is not a trade to act on yet, but i would imagine that things can get crazy, right? so if price comes into this zone over and it starts to lose this, and i'll zoom in to show you, and you measure from top to bottom, where does eighty percent? the typical pullback or selloff that you would receive in a bear market
including bitcoin can even sell off 80 from all time high to low
watch see if price comes down here, if it starts to reject and test that area as resistance over there, then i would start to activate my short position
and i would say, most definitely it's going to come back into that zone over there, into the liquidity zone
so not necessarily for leveraged trader, but if you are spot trader and you're looking to grab some position, some long term positions, then that could be an option for you
so if you have a look in the youtube description over there, again, just, uh, showing all the links they're all there, twitter, instagram, by bit
use the buy but link if you are going to use any of these trade ideas
i would expect it is going to be quite a lot of volatility coming up
where we were looking for those potential long positions, the bitcoin price going all the way up to the 32 000 having it stopped here at the 30 600 range, and then another leg up to 32 000 range here, so we can look for those shorting opportunities
and once we had this big, aggressive drop, we were also taking a look at these major levels here, the thirty thousand six hundred dollars, to take that shorting opportunity
also, it's been an absolute crazy week here for bitcoin because yesterday we were talking about the scenario here of us getting rejected here at the thirty 31 500 level, having that consolidation and that potential drop, also on yesterday's live stream
now, if you want to know what do i think can happen for bitcoin the most important levels, make sure to stay tuned in this episode
what happened the last couple of weeks was just absolutely pure luck
i have no idea where the price can go, where the price can get rejected or supported
make sure to subscribe to the channel daily today on bitcoin crypto, also the live stream to connect with the community
i'm gonna go straight into the point here, because this is the bitcoin chart
i was pretty surprised we actually didn't hold this thirty thousand seven hundred dollar area where we do have massive touches here as resistance
remember, it is also the value area, high from this trading range
okay, apart from this volatility that we did have above, remember, this was a very, very strong level, as you can see here, bouncing several times as resistance
didn't hold as support one single bit, as you can see here on the chart
so now, what could happen after this aggressive drop? we can clearly see that we are getting a stop
we actually got a major consolidation from this 29 300 area, as you can see if we zoom in on the two hourly
we were getting a nice consolidation for a potential long opportunity
but i would be super, super cautious, because we could probably get exhausted and roll back down
now, what are the most important levels here on bitcoin as resistance where we could potentially get rejected? were we already hitting a major level at this point? why is it a major level? you can go to the two hourly chart, the full hourly chart
it doesn't really matter, because they do open and close at similar levels
so the back of this range can actually hold a little bit of resistance because we've had such an aggressive drop
what other level is extremely important here on bitcoin, of course, would be the 50 range
the 50 range from this actual drop that we did have yesterday, starting from the 31 700 area
okay, from this major drop, we're taking a look at fibonacci levels, the 50 level and the 618, my favorite levels, of course, uh, where we could potentially get rejected on the price of btc
but not only this, on the 50 level, the 30 473 dollars approximately, we do have major four hourly closers
all of these four hourly closers are exactly, okay, the third of june, they are exactly at that range at 30, 400, 330, 500 area
if we start getting some type of consolidation in the next couple of days
at this level, it might be a very good level where we can see the price of bitcoin dropping down
okay, so this is what i'm going to eye in the next coming days
am i going to speculate that this price is going to go all the way up here? absolutely not
where is the six, one eight? well, it is slightly higher than the thirty thousand five hundred dollar range
if i take a look at fib level, it is at thirty thousand seven hundred dollar area
okay? it's also these major spikes where the price action on bitcoin didn't manage to get up
so if we do see this in the next few days, remember, this is a major, major level of potential volatility
we could have some consolidations and maybe get that rejection to the downside
this is something that we're going to eye in the next coming days
we can consolidate sideways and continue back down, of course
so this is something that we're going to talk about in the next coming days
now we're going to go through the sponsor segment of this video
we're going to talk about magic's leveraged trading platform, upcoming, major platform that is very much talked about and gaining in volume by the week
it has a combined liquidity of 12 exchanges in one place, so you don't have to worry about liquidity

fifty dollars on top of a plus point, zero, zero, four bitcoin deposited
and also, you're getting 15 added to your deposit if you deposit more than 300 to pay trading fees
now, what happens if bitcoin does actually break this zone? what happens if we do break here the lows of 29 300? then, of course, what is the major level where i can see a potential bounce, if we do get a reaction, if we do get us consolidation? this level is exactly here, at the 28 600
this is the value area low from the volume traded the last 25 days, approximately 20 to 30 days
the value area low, as you can see on the volume profile, is this level, 28 600
so if you do see the price of btc actually breaking down this zone, we could have an aggressive drop
if we do consolidate at this level, it's the level where i will potentially look for some longing opportunities, at least to the 30, that 29 000, sorry, 300 range
okay? whether it's where we do have these big bounces as support
so major levels to take massive opportunities in bitcoin the next coming days
i'm not sure if we are going to manage, in the next coming hours to come here to the 30 400, 30 500, where i do expect the price to consolidate for a while, for looking for those potential shining opportunities
of course, after such an aggressive drop, price of bitcoin can go sideways for quite some time
but if we do start dropping in the next coming hours, okay, i do expect this level to hold very nicely
if we do start consolidating, i would see the bears that they are getting exhausted
and this could give us a short term opportunity to drive all the way up at least to around about that 29 300 range
of course, as soon as we start breaking these major support levels, the probabilities and actually coming down to that 25 000 area low over the 12th of may, then it is higher probable, okay? once we start losing these support levels, that we are actually going to come down there, guys
as soon as we start breaking successfully twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, that if this does happen the next coming days, we will be looking for those opportunities at this range
but because this still hasn't happened, we're just looking inside of the range
check out the bitcoin center website for the latest news and technical analysis ideas
let's analyze the situation here for bitcoin, because we're going to talk about why we were looking for this short position
and i got to be totally honest here, i did not expect the btc price to absolutely slice through this thirty thousand six hundred dollars
but as a trader, it doesn't matter if it doesn't stop at this level
and you're actually shorting this range, because i was looking for this stop, guys
and one of the most important things that i repeat every single time
i think we're not many here in the comment section, but i can see here, joseph, mark dutch, how are you doing, my man
um, yesterday's live stream, we were talking about this scenario over here, getting that consolidation, having that ascending channel that might start goes going sideways, and will potentially give us that trading opportunity
i'm going to explain also why to enter that major opportunity
it was a major consolidation area when we did have the drop on the first of june here
of course, all the way up here at these resistance levels, after this big, major pump, i am not looking for long positions
and you know, we were talking about the risk to reward on this trade
it's super important, guys, because i want to explain every single detail of this potential short opportunity
this was the ascending channel that i did have on yesterday's live stream
as you can see, the ascending channel, we can go to the 15 minute, you know, looking for that sideways action and potential giving us a shorting opportunity
i gotta say, i was extremely lucky on this trade because, well, i gotta say, there is some, you know, there is
i was lucky on this trade because my stop loss was at one that, uh, thirty one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars
i took 50 of profit at 30 700 range, where we talked about yesterday, this major level that was supposedly going to hold as support
i've only got twenty five percent of my trade open from this range
it didn't get hit magically, because it did actually reach the one thousand, the thirty one thousand seven hundred and fifty
so, i mean, that would have been such a, such um, you know, this does happen
you know, you maybe get us really lucky with your stoploss, or you maybe just go get your stoploss hit, and then the price absolutely tumbles
but i wanted to explain also, you know, the reason why we did get into this trade
sorry, i don't say we, because i never say who needs to trade or not
we are not, uh, we are a team, but everyone does their own thing, right? at the end of the day, you take your own decision
now, this was the channel that we were talking about yesterday, and you could check out yesterday's live stream
i'm looking at for that to break out of the channel, you know, and maybe retesting resistance
now, what happened here? if we take a look at the bitcoin price, we were starting to go sideways
okay, after going sideways, i was expecting some kind of leg up, okay, and then potentially down
but we could already see the exhaustion at this major resistance level
you could already see that, you know, the reaction at this range, this is when i want to decide to take a trade or not
um, not getting stopped out, because the my stop loss was there
and yesterday i was explaining here, you know, the risk to reward that there is, you know, if you get stopped out
i was in the telegram group, you know, people, are you stealing your shorts? do you still think you were going to go come down? and i said, yes, i'm in the short position
and this is super important to understand, guys, because, um, you cannot stress this enough, it takes a long time to understand that you are here to make good risk to reward trades
and if you enter here at thirty one thousand four hundred and fifty, uh? thirty one thousand four hundred and fifty, 95, sorry
if you enter here at this um, at this level, and you have a stop loss at this range, you know, and you are looking for that thirty thousand seven hundred dollars after this major reaction at this price level, because it is a strong level
and you can clearly see here the risk to reward is, you know, it's at least a three to one, right? it's a three to one trade
so imagine, if you have all of these, how many trades you can have these and getting stopped out? you can get stopped out, you know, out of 10 trades, you can get stopped out 15 times, and you will still be profitable, as long as you do get, you know, some, some of those straight winning trades
but this is why we're taking a look at the most, the highest probability trades, of course, uh, all the time
um, i'm still in this, i i'm actually still in this long position
uh, obviously, i did take 80 percent of profits from this trade
did a long position here, long position here, short position right over here
um, i did not take any trade here, because we were looking at two scenarios
you know, this could have been a descending triangle formation, or a double bottom out of an eve
of course, the double bottom, adam and eve, we do have a target here, a supposed target, a supposed projected move, which is taking us all the way to the 32 000 range
did i take any trade here? no, it's, you know, it doesn't matter how you how you analyze the market
at the end of the day, you need to know when you need to get into your positions and make money
you can be the best at technical analyst guy in the world, and you will lose money if you don't have good risk management
and i want to be totally transparent and humble with my community, because, you you you can be a crappy technical analysis and you can make money trading
and if that's period most important thing to make money, is have to good, have good risk management, of course
and having good risk management, your emotions will be extremely low
you will not care if you only risk one, two, three percent of your capital
i am absolutely, almost certain that ninety percent of your people always risk more than five percent of your trading capital when you're trading
and, um, yeah, it's been absolutely more than proven that most of the people lose money trading
most of the people risk more than five percent, even 10, more than 10, 10 and even 50 more
i mean, i'm saying more than five percent to be good emotionally by trading, you need to risk one to three percent
and you need to have extremely good risk management, extremely good risk management
and that is it, because you want to find those, you know, trades that are a risk, you know, three to four, um to one, you know, risk to reward
i mean, i did not expect this, of course, i'm riding a trade here, but this is also the good thing
once you hit your take profit zone, once you hit a major, strong level, you protect yourself, you take profits, and then let's see what happens
now, on yesterday's live stream, we were talking about, i mean, guys, this is super important
i want to go through the comment section guys, but i want to explain everything here, the reasons why, you know, risk management
send him the send me his youtube link, because i'm going to say, man, you're, you're huge
if you, if you do know someone, join the telegram, pass me his link
because all i got to say to to to him is, you know, his kudos to him, um, but i don't see anyone, most of the people yesterday were bullish
most of them, okay, there was some people bearish, but if you take a look at most of youtubers, most of these, you know, big crypto influencers, most of them are, we're bullish at this range
you know, we can go on the telegram group and and send a few youtube, uh, videos from crypto influencers
you know, i'm all in on bitcoin, uh, you know, this is going to be absolutely huge
on yesterday's live stream, we're looking for that day trade scalp
on yesterday's live stream, we're not looking for long positions
of course, could have, we've gone higher? yes, we could have gone higher, because we had this adam and eve situation
but most importantly, why were we looking for shorts? we were looking for shorts because we were hitting a resistance level, a big, major consolidation level that we had on the 31st and 1st of june
and we also, you know, hitting the 618 here, but we were, we had a lot of volatility in the end
you know, um, i could have been more patient, because i was inside of the trade while we were having this leg up, almost getting stopped out
and also, if we take a look at the vpvr here from each day, we have a such a huge, strong level here
you know, of course, all of this consolidation, you're going to have your vpvr here at the 31600, right there
of course, with some volatility, it's not an exact science, you're going to have that volatility
okay? showing you the exhaustion, showing you the exhaustion of the balls
and this is the moment you decide, are you, are you willing to get into short because i gotta say, a lot of people are gonna say, you know, this is a bull flag
we having continuation to the upside um? for me, no, this is not the case most of the times
you if you are a subscriber, i short at resistance no matter how big the pump is, no matter how bullish it looks
if we are hitting a major resistance level, i will be looking for shorts, potentially
if we are coming down, okay, and we do have a consolidation, i will be looking for long positions also
but this is why sometimes you just need to take 50 profits and ride the rest and protect your position
um, this short position was explained on yesterday's live stream at the end
i just did a quick recap here on this potential scenario that played out absolutely beautifully
you know, yesterday in the telegram group, you know, some people were going long, some people were were taking that shorts
and i got, i got to be totally sorry here, but, you know, i was bullish, but i was looking for this retracement and this potential bounce
another explanation here, because a lot of people might think, andy, you said that this is a major level
you said that this 30 700 range is going to be an insane level
you said that we were potentially going to bounce from this level
but why didn't i take a trade here? why did i take profits from this short position here? um, because it's a big level
why didn't i long here? and you know, i, i know most of you are going to know, most of the subscribers, i know my moderators know, why didn't i long here? reason number one, i was sleeping
but, yeah, that doesn't count, because we did not get a reaction from this range, guys
if if, this morning, i would have woken up and we would have been doing this, you know, a couple of weeks, you know, seen a consolidation
you must have heard, you know, from people, do not catch a falling knife, right? well, yeah, this is true
no matter how big the level is, no matter how well respected it has been in the past
the reason why is because if i put a limit order, thinking, yeah, this is a double bottom
i'm gonna go to sleep because, you know, we're, we're very likely going to get hot
we, we're very likely going to hold this level our support for potential continuation to the upside
no, i did not put any limit order here, because i know in crypto, bitcoin, any crypto this over here, is very, very possible you can slice through a major, important level, no matter how strong it is
so, i mean, this is a massive, huge liquidity grab below this range
sometimes how bitcoin, you know, crypto is just looking for liquidity, basically
the amount of people that were insanely bullish yesterday is absolutely crazy
i mean, i don't want to call anyone, all right? because it's not fair
i'm just going to say there were a bunch of youtubers, you know, just losing it
they were just over the moon that we had this small, little pump on bitcoin, all right, of six, seven percent
and, yeah, of course we're going to alltime highs, uh, in a week after this pump
just wanted to give you an explanation on, you know, why, why, you know, i've been profitable, you know, the last, the last 10 days in bitcoin, even being wrong at some levels, even being wrong at this double bottom, you know, potential 32 000 level target
i did not trade this, this bounce over here, because we did not get the reaction
hola, amigos, how are you doing? smash that like button on your way in
i am trying to give what, what i know, and being totally transparent and humble with technical analysis, you know, potential training opportunities, good risk management
i do not see anyone on youtube, you know, being being like this
i'm going to stop because i, i, i really think i am giving super valued, valuable information
and i will be doing, i mean, i'm not going to do, i'm going to do a course
i'm going to do an actual um trading group, okay? on discord after the summer, by the end of the year, before the end of the year, actually
because, i mean, yeah, i mean, i think it's, i'm just giving a lot of good, valuable information, and smash up the like button for that, please, guys, because i will end youtube tomorrow if i don't get 200 likes right away, in the next two minutes
legend says, seb said, thank you, seb, for joining the live stream
i mean, this is the thing, it doesn't matter, we are going to absolutely crush the charts, guys
looking for those opportunities every single day, or every single other day
don't worry, i would have, i mean, i would have been a little bit annoyed, i got to say, i would have been a little bit annoyed if i would have got stopped out, and then this morning i would have seen this price action
okay? we've seen exhaustion on the price action, you know, uh, 618 from this drop, this consolidation
i don't know if i'm because, yeah, i was basically sleeping here
but who knows? i would have probably reentered the trade, or maybe not
i was extremely lucky my stoploss wasn't hit, because it did actually hit my stop loss to the dollar
and usually, if it's a take profit, it definitely wouldn't have got hit
most of the times it doesn't get but stop losses usually get hit
you know, even a dollar away from your stop all depending on the on the, on the, on the order book, of course
uh, you might have been from the first one to be getting stopped out in the order book
um, now this has happened, let's see what could happen for bitcoin
if we do take a look at the vpvr inside the range, you know, the possibilities in actually retesting the 28 600 range is very, very high
is this low going to hold? is the 28 600 range going to hold? is the value area low? it is a solid, solid level here as support
but this was also a solid level of resistance that didn't manage to hold our support
we will find out how are we going to react at these levels in the next coming days
this is a little bit of no man's land for me, uh, for trading
because we were getting that reaction here, we could have created a lower high
i waited patiently to see the highest probability trade, um, the next day
okay? because on on the live stream two days ago, we were talking about this descending triangle or double bottom, i did not take any trade
so it doesn't matter if you did get stopped out here, it was a small stop
i mean, this is almost a ten to one trade right now at this moment um
can we get an insane balance from this range? yes, because this probably has just been a liquidity grab
but i think we are very likely going to go lower after this, this massive failed attempt in going higher
it's the highest volume that we do have here for the last, you know, 1015 days
um, the the the highest volume that we did have was from this swing failure pattern
this was a trade that i did take right over here on the retracement, looking for that retest and that consolidation and that bounce up
and this is what i try to explain on a lot of the live streams
remember guys, you can go to the live stream on the 27th of may on my channel
i'm totally transparent here with the community, with my trades
the risk to reward from this trade was at least a four to one
you can see the distance from what i am risking here for that profit that i was looking for here at this at this 32 000 area
you know, this is a bunch of liquidity area, so it's very likely to come back up to this range
this is also why i took most of my profits from this long and i shorted this level also
i'm telling you this, [Music] trades have been absolutely insane for the last couple of weeks
uh, is the shorting from here? or does he mean he shorted from 31 600 area here to here
this is what i'm explaining that i'm still remaining in this short position
i've just taken 50 more of profit this morning at these levels, of course
i still have a small percentage of the long position from so i'm in a hedge position at this moment
i'm still remaining in this long or also from the 28th of may
i i gotta say, i'm i was really lucky not getting stopped out
but we were looking for that shorting opportunity at this major resistance level, having that reaction, big support range from this consolidation
the svp, big spikes here, as you can see, right there, getting that resistance and looking for short, short positions
after going sideways from this channel mentioned yesterday, you know, the moment we start going sideways, uh, it is very, very possible
looking for that thirty thousand seven hundred thirty thousand eight hundred dollar range um only looking for shorts, we got the dxy pumping a little bit, just about to break resistance
you know, the dxy, you know, we have broken out from a major, major, major parabolic uptrend, as you can see, very aggressive higher lows
now, what does usually happen when you break out from a trend line? um, most of the people think, all right, it is, you know, very likely going to continue to the downside
but what happens? a lot of the times, you actually come up and retest the support
we can actually break the highs on the dxy and create a slide, slightly high high
and this signals that we are very likely to to double top, or create a slightly lower high on the dxy
this is what usually happens, basically, you know, you break a trend line
but you actually come all the way back up to retest the support and then go down
this doesn't mean that you are, you know, this means that you are getting exhausted
this means that the trend, this parabolic trend, is getting exhausted
does it mean you're going down from this range? no, absolutely not
and very likely, you know, the next leg ups are not going to be as successful as this leg up
it might, it might take a few months, of course, this is the the four hourly chart
um, do you see a downtrend created on the dxy in the next few months? i'm going to go through comment section here, guys
how are you? um, fran frantisek says, i am after night shift, but i made double money with this short
um, was it a tested support the 30? was it a test to support the 30 600? yes, absolutely
i mean, this is the thing we were looking for, that support level
but guys remember, like, because i i will have people bashing me, just like the same people that were bashing me here
uh, at this level, a lot of people were saying, you know, you, you said we were gonna, we were going to bounce from this level
i said, you know, it's very likely we're going to get a reaction
like i said yesterday, we will dump after daily clothes if we get hidden bear dive edge divergence, says andreas, absolutely phenomenal
holy crap, says crypto a l yeah, i was not expecting this low
okay? i was looking for that three to one risk to reward trade from this level, four to one, three to one, approximately
i haven't actually measured the exit the exact range, but, yeah, this is why, you know, i had a 50 percent take profit here, automatically, because it was very early in the morning
wasn't expecting this drop, but if it comes, you know, this is why i take fifty percent of profits, or sixty or forty, and usually it's about 50
mage you want to take profit one, just in case you don't get a reaction and you have that magical drop, which is, you know, yeah, even better
uh, okay? or 24, 24k, yeah, i'm gonna, i'm gonna hold a small position
why not? i will be taking profits on the way down? uh, absolutely
um, i don't need to have a trade open for for for a month or so
i mean, this is the thing, you know, the train comes by every single day
when you do technical analysis, you know some sometimes, you know, the train only happen, passes once
you decide if you want to hop in, you know, the wrecked train or the profitable train
i mean, this is the thing, after such an aggressive drop, it's just gonna be boring, potentially
so can we get another? can we get a balance from this level? absolutely, this is totally possible
there is a possibility you might be creating a a descending triangle scenario here
not much to add, but i do see lower after such an aggressive drop
let's wait to see where are the price levels to find, you know, where we're going to have those reactions
uh, this reaction is still, um, yeah, we this is obviously we, i need a longer reaction at this range for a potential long not looking for shorts at this range
but i do see lower after this aggressive drop, with super high volume
i mean, an ideal range would be the thirty thousand, six hundred dollar area, if we do come up to this range
okay, in the next hours, couple of days, i will be doing a video update on what i think could happen on the on the market
this is just a recap of what yesterday happened, or what happened yesterday
looking for those strong levels, looking for those major trading opportunities
why where i would enter? what am i waiting for, guys? and you need to absolutely crush that like button if you enjoy the content, guys, because it's extremely important for me that i do see support
i know a lot of you people, um, are giving insane support here
and i think this is the most important thing here in crypto and on youtube, guys, most of it
i know these thumbnails, i know these thumbnails are good to attract people, but yeah, i really, really want to be um, humble with with my community
if you are an experienced trader, and i know maybe a lot of you aren't, check out buy bits, because this is where i'm swing trading
if you are an experienced trader, you can use the link down below, because i do get a small commission, and you get the best bonus available
okay? if you're still learning, if you are not experienced, do not trade
okay? it's always good to lose money also, because losing money is part of the game
but don't risk more than one to three percent of your capital
if you have a thousand dollars, you know you risk in third, ten to thirty dollars
if you have ten thousand dollars on your trading account, only trades of one hundred dollars and three hundred dollars, no way i'm risking the five thousand dollars on that trade
yeah, you are going to get wrecked if you are using that kind of risk management, only one to three percent of your capital
imagine just having a, having a 100 000 account and only having trades of thousand, two thousand dollars
because you're risking one or two percent of your capital, your emotions disappear
i was not highly attached of my of on my trade here, because it's low capital
so i'm thinking, yo, if i get stopped out, it doesn't matter, because these are the kind of trades that i'm looking for a risk to reward, a three to one, a three to four to one risk to reward trade
primix bt is my favorite day trading platform for any other assets
and i have to say, because i've been talking about natural gas and gold, okay, looking for some trades
uh, i'm going to wait for a consolidation, uh, at these levels
okay, i want to, i want to clear this, okay, because it's not fair
but i closed just in case we do get some power here the next coming days, or depending on how we react at these levels, i will reopen a short on natural gas
you know, we are in a very aggressive uptrend, but i see this as a kind of a distribution
and i shorted here at um eight dollar eighty cents, approximately, on this bounce up, looking for that potential leg down
you know, this is, uh, it's, uh, it's an important um asset commodity that is used every single day
they are difficult because fundamentals look, you know, they are strong
because of the current world situation, you know, this can go too much higher levels
but i'm looking at the technicals, i'm trying to have really good risk to reward trades
i don't mind exiting here at a small loss on these positions, because i am looking for a good, good, okay, potential drop here on natural gas
you know, we are maybe going to gain these highs and go to much higher levels
i am looking to continue with these markets, okay? i am looking to continue with natural gas, crude oil and s p 500 if i do see any opportunities
but obviously, 80 of the times, focusing on bitcoin and crypto, k 80 on bitcoin, maybe some altcoins ethereum, some major opportunities
but, uh, if you are interested in trading, you know, crude oil, natural gas, s p 500, you have this platform over here, which is insane, primex bt
you're using bitcoin ethereum as collateral, or usdt or ustc, stable coins, if you wish
if you want to accumulate stable coins or bitcoin ethereum, you do not want to use, okay, another broker to to actually trade, uh, these commodities, you can use primexpt
and the good thing about primax bt is that you get seven percent added to your deposit to trade with for but for, you know, you have more trading power
you deposit 10 000, you get seven hundred dollars on top of that
i have a full tutorial on primex bt down below, guys, whoever's interested
and this is only only only for experienced traders, and only if you do have good risk management okay, please, guys, if you do have no idea, wait, practice
or if you're only going to risk a small amount, just risk a small amount
but as long as it's just a little bit, as long as it's just a little bit, um, hands down the best ta analyst on youtube, says, josh, yeah, no, i'm not the best, not the best
uh, andy, are you longing now? no, i am not longing now, no, but, uh, because i do see lower
okay, so the possibilities here and getting a reaction the next coming hours, a couple of days
i will be doing a video update of, you know, eight minute, 10 minute, 12 minute, whatever it is
you know, looking at the major levels, looking at the possibilities on what can happen
and, um, yeah, i'm basically gonna gonna try and do a nice video update on bitcoin by ordering fan
after such an aggressive drop, you know, some relief rallies is possible
it's just very likely gonna be a little bit of boring price action
you might have some wicks to the downside, some to the upside
i don't see a clear, you know, massive v v recovery or an aggressive drop from this level
i think it's going to be a little bit boring, sideways action
maybe slightly to the upside, slightly to the downside, but not no clear directions
i got my moderators here going mad in the chat, uh, because i do have a, yeah, sorry, sorry
but, i mean, you can watch yesterday's live stream, ethereum isn't a massive, kind of descending triangle
we were basically, just to keep it simple in a nutshell, i was, we were taking a look at bitcoin yesterday
if we are, if i was looking out for short positions, if i'm looking for short positions at this range, i'm not going to be looking for long positions on on ethereum
you know, this is the the key thing that you need to know in crypto
bitcoin, 90 of the times, leads the way for most of the altcoins, especially ethereum
all right, we have seen another bitcoin dominance having a slightly correction
but if it's going up and bitcoin goes down, you know, or up, it doesn't matter
so i am looking for short positions here yesterday, at this range, right? then i'll think, okay, let's analyze ethereum and look for the shorting position levels
and what we do have here is that we do have a major resistance here from lower highs trend line, lower high trend line
we've also got a pretty aggressive support level that should be holding us resistance
you do see a few hourly candlesticks right over here at this level
so you need to decide here if you are going to take a short position
you have a major, strong support as you can see here, major, major level
if you are looking for short positions on, if i am sorry, if i am looking for short positions on bitcoin here, you know, it's, um, yeah
you you will not see me looking for shorts on on bitcoin and saying, yeah, but i'm gonna go long on ethereum
it's not gonna happen because you can't see it from yesterday
if, if early this morning, sorry, if bitcoin falls, you know, ethereum is very likely gonna fall also
i was, i would be looking for shorts, because i'm looking for shorts on bitcoin
so that would have been a shorting opportunity right there the 1900 range
if i'm wrong, most importantly, here on this channel, if i am wrong, i'm going to come in here and i'm going to say, guys, i am wrong
why was i wrong? did we lose much money? what was the risk to reward rate? and this is the most important thing to become a successful trader, and for you guys to become a successful trader
but it's just a little bit of a kind of an educational live stream showing you, you know, the potential good trading opportunities, risk to reward
why do we take this trade? why are we consolidating here? and explaining why guys, so you, by tomorrow, can become a better trader
ethereum is at the strongest level of support, which is the 1700 range
let me tell you one thing, if bitcoin does come down to the 25 000 area in the next coming weeks, days, it's gonna be bad for ethereum
this is a bearish pattern at the end of the day, because you have very aggressive selling pressure creating lower highs, and you have an important demand zone, buying level, where it's probably not going to hold, because the selling pressure is pushing the price lower and lower
if bitcoin does come down to 25k, or even lower, in the next coming weeks, we can't expect ethereum to break this zone
this is the thing on ethereum, you know, potential relief rallies is very, very possible
you hit the 618 also, i mean, this was a must take trade, guys
it was, you know, i only traded a bitcoin, but i could have, you know, added a position on ethereum
okay? right over here, you are in a lower high trend line, resistance being respected many, many times
not hitting it, but, yeah, risk to reward on this was was huge
um, you could potentially look for the six, one, eight bounce here from this high to the low
you know, are we going to let you know, have we got enough confluence at this range? we do have a major resistance consolidation at this level, so who knows, we might have that bounce here on ethereum, coming back up to the 1 850 range, if you start getting a small reaction from this level
i mean, this looks a pretty, i mean, let's go to the 30 minute chart
um, i would go with the um volume profile here from this range
uh, just to check the confluence that we do have at this range
um, yeah, we do have a pretty large spike here, just slightly above on the on the 618, from yesterday's traded volume
if you do get that large relief rally, you can see on the price action, you are getting stopped on, uh, you know, add resistance from at this range
you break above that level, it we did consolidate a little bit there
so if we do have a retracement to that eight, eight, one thousand eight hundred and forty five dollars, approximately around that range, and you start getting a reaction, you're hitting the six, one, eight
you got a big point of control from the volume traded from yesterday
you you can expect that potential correction from that range to continue this this aggressive downtrend um
do you hold btc ethereum and link only long term? no, i do not
i also got some dragon chain, and my moderators make fun of me because dragon chain has a kind of disney logo
but i think it's a really important project, very similar to unibrite
i really strongly believe in this project, and this is going to enter a massive accumulation zone
why not? why not? why not? it's pretty funny how these bears come along
let me just ask in the poll here, did you start investing in crypto in 2021? 2022? guys, let me know in the comment section
so i did actually get into the all of the bear market of 2019 and 2020
and i just want to give a heads up for everybody that hasn't started investing in 2021, 2022
because if you hold, if you hold for the next few years, and accumulate good projects, good cryptos
definitely bitcoin and ethereum, in my humble opinion, because, you know, can it go to zero? yeah
but to go to zero, you know, we would have to have an absolutely shut down of everything, no electricity, no internet
if we start seeing these computers closing down, you can start mining bitcoin from your laptop, if, you know, the difficulty goes down
if we do see that shutdown on those computers, you know, bitcoin is, is, is here to absolutely survive all of these massive events
that they're very likely going to gain much more value in the next coming years
and i just want to give a heads up, okay, for all of those people that have invested in 2021 and 202, that you have invested in the wrong time, but this is when most of the people start investing, when you do have this big, massive height, when people, you know, you have your grandmother talking about crypto, you have your dog talking about crypto
this is gonna be potentially an aggressive manipulation to push the prices of bitcoin and good projects to the downside
it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if bitcoin goes to ten thousand dollars
i will be buying a huge amount of bitcoin, and i will be supporting, you know, the decentralization, of course, because we are
we're living in a massive manipulated, okay? uh, government of all of the countries, and and bitcoin is, is is is the lifeboat
uh? so i just want to be here for the next coming years, support all of those people that are going to, okay, be in crypto
and it's pretty funny, because i do see some, some of these comments, you know, bitcoins going down to 14k
i mean, if it does go down, it's going to be there, a legendary opportunity to to get to buy bitcoin and some of these cryptos
i have no idea where bitcoin is going, uh, uh? in in the next coming months
but come on, you cannot say, uh, you cannot say, you know, we're not going to 10k, we're going to 14k
um, yeah, please, please come and share your ta on the telegram group
give us an explanation why bitcoin is going to go down to 14k
i i did an explanation on bitcoin can go to 12k because the price action
my explanation, and it's a pretty simple one, but it's sometimes very effective
you know, when you the price action moves fast inside of a price range, it can move as fast to the downside also
from twelve thousand dollars, you know, all the way to forty thousand dollars
and what happens when you move this fast is you do not leave a track record, right off of volume, meaning that the price, okay? because of the amount of demand, price just goes up and up and up and up and up and up
when price goes up that fast, is because there's such a huge wave of demand coming in that the price just goes, it just pumps, it just goes up
so now what happens here is, is this price sustainable? is there enough demand at this level? and no, of course not
so this level over here, we might see an aggressive drop in the next coming months, all right? from the next coming weeks and months
at this range, it is possible till you actually find the floor level, and and find a good demand zone for a reaccumulation, for an accumulation event
biggest spike on the vpvr from the volume trader the last five, four to five years the biggest spike starts at twelve thousand dollars
reason why? like i said, because there was a huge amount of demand
you know, you know, in in october, november, december, there was a huge amount of demand, demand, and price just skyrockets
but it doesn't mean that this is a, you know, a sustainable price level
you know, you we can have a pretty aggressive drop if we successfully lose this important level
uh, is that a huge double top bitcoin? those two big mountains
and, you know, my question is, did you start investing in crypto in 2021 and 2022? 68 of people say yes
if you do hold the next coming years, this aggressive sideways, or even downside price action, going to 20 000, or even below 20 000, it's gonna be an opportunity of a lifetime
because the big macro trend on bitcoin, the fundamentals are huge
if you got into that short, epic, short position talk mentioned on yesterday's live stream, you know, congratulations
if you get stopped, if you did get stopped out, it doesn't matter
if you want some insane bonuses, you do have buybit with an insane bonus of up to thousand and fifty dollars, okay, that you can claim in the rewards hub, following the steps
you get seven percent added to your deposit, which is absolutely huge

um, this is a pretty cool project to get real world data into the blockchain
i mean, it's got absolutely, um, yeah, it's got absolutely crushed
can we lost the summer lows of 2021? um, this is not the moment to be extremely bearish
but this is the moment that, you know, we're very likely not going to go much, much lower
i haven't been checking portfolio for for quite some time because it's, it's just there
looking at the chart here, i don't know, do you want to know short term analysis? i'm not sure if you can trade this on ocean yet
at the end of the day, um, this one is holding the range pretty nicely
most of people think that might, this might be a bear flag, and you're going to go to much lower levels
if bitcoin does go lower, we are going to see these, all coins go to lower levels, of course
but, um, yeah, i would, i would have focused on trading on this extremely volatile crypto
and if we start, you know, creating this kind of price action at the lows, it would be a nice double bottom swing failure pattern
i don't think this one's going to go, you know, to 10 cents or 5 cents
i would be looking for trading opportunities inside of the range
i would be looking for range trading on these cryptos, tight stop losses, because, you know, these are extremely volatile, uh
you can see here swing failure pattern just right over here, gaining the high, right? this is the kind of trading opportunities that you're looking for, swing failure patterns from these highs, as you can see, big, massive rejection gaining this high and turning around to reclaim the lows
so this is the kind of of trading opportunities that i would be looking for on these altcoins
claim this low over here, boom, boom, boom, and a potential swing failure pattern for a big bounce
but you know, this is already very, very interesting levels to accumulate
but dollar cost average is the key level for the next coming years
in today's episode, i will show you exactly how this supply zone was respected
and this was something that i talked about in yesterday's video
i will show you exactly step by step on the lower time frames, and how we could have added up another resistance right here that gave us the confirmation that the market was actually supposed to go down
i will also show you exactly what i see right now on ethereum
don't forget that i'm no financial advice, so you need to look up everything yourself first
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly what i see right now on bitcoin and on ethereum
if you looked at my video yesterday, we were talking about three different levels
we also had the fibonacci, if we dragged it from the last high, a little high, to the low
so we knew that if we were break the the the supply around 31 950, we would reach the 12 hourly fibonacci
to see if this would happen around the levels on the inside the fibonacci
so we can take away the fibonacci, and we're focusing on, okay, what did exactly happen? so yesterday we came back up
and this is the good thing when it comes to supply and demand zone
a supply or a demand zone is where the market just coming for a quick retest, and then see the market bounce to the either the upside or to the downside
and if we go down to the four outlet chart now to see the first clue that we did have was obviously this wick
but that, for me, wasn't a confirmation that the market was actually supposed to go down
an inverted hammer means that the market is reversing back down
so when we use the trend lines, you can obviously use it like this
it's not the best looking trend line, but this is only because we want to see the break of structure
and then we go down to the 30 minute chart, and this is exactly how it looks
and the market came exactly up to these fibonacci levels, and then you saw this huge drop back down to almost the previous or we came back down to the support one more time
but what we can do now is that we drag another support channel, another support around 29 and 600
but we need to look at the highest time frames to see where we can, where we potentially can come back down to
so the overall on bitcoin right now, we are in a sideways market
the market has just been bouncing in between this support that we did have, around 28 400, and the resistance around thirty one thousand four hundred
so we can definitely see the market pull back down to the support one more time
so when we see the market, if the market now reaches the support, a very important thing we need to make sure is that we, if we would see the market continue, we need to have a clear breakout
we need to have, usually the market doesn't give us a retest, but it doesn't have to happen
but we definitely need to see the market give us a clear breakout
and the next candlesticks that comes after it just like this one
this is where the fake out comes in when we see the market break one resistance
and you see the retest when we start to have so much momentum now to the downside
this is just screaming that the market is not ready to pull back to the upside
and this is also another confirmation that we could have had when we saw that this move happened, was that we tried to break the exact same level we tried to break before, but the market never had the power to do that
so what happened? we saw the market try to break the resistance
but now remember that, okay, we did retest the the supply zone, and we also had this inverted hammer
so for the market to bounce back down, that was, this was something that we could have count on
but now focus on what's happening, uh, down here, on the on the support
so when we're focusing what's happened here, this is exactly the same thing that can happen down at the support
we see the market try to break in, and then you see the market close inside
we see a retest from this, from the previous support, the same way we did with this resistance
we can break it, break inside of it, retest of the same support, and then see the market bounce back up, maybe not the whole way to the res to the resistance again, but definitely come back in, potentially maybe create a lower high, and then see the continuation to the downside
it's more likely that if we come back down to the support, that we break the support, then breaking the resistance, because the overall, the market is in a very heavily downtrend
and if we break the support trendline, if we break the support, the first level that i will look at is at 25 and 200
if we go to ethereum, i already have the setups right now, so we can go down to the four hourly
we came back up to the fibonacci levels instead when it came to ethereum
so we did retest 1880 and 1910, and then you saw this huge drop
another thing that i also added to it, confirmation that we're going down, is that we came back up and retested this previous report that we did have around 1887
going down to the lower time frames, this was also where we came back up and retested
remember that if we have a a support like this on the lower time frames, you will definitely see the market pull back up to this level
and combine with the trend, with the fibonacci, combined with the weekly support that we did break, retests created as a new resistance
and now if we focus on what's happening on the lower time frames, what happened right here? we could see the market gave us a pullback
and if you were in my morning live stream, i also showed you that we could have used this little low and this little high around 1807 back down to the low
and what happened? the market did the exact same thing you saw the market pull back, retested the 618 percent precisely
we take the fibonacci from the high to the low, and then what happened? market went straight down
to potentially one thousand seven hundred, based on this fibonacci that we have here
take profit one is around one thousand seven hundred and eight
take profit three is around one thousand six hundred and sixty four
another thing that we can have in mind is obviously that we're coming back down to a support
but if we see that the candles, the coming candlestick, starts to close below this level at 1745, this could be a potential new resistance, also a potential new lower high
and that could be, for me, another entry to sell the market on ethereum
and if you were on my morning livestream, we were also going through dots, and i took a fibonacci from 926 back down to or from back down to eight point to 93
what happened was the market came in exactly to the fibonacci levels, and then you saw the market bounce back down
take profit one is at eight point, eight point eight to three
take profit two is at eight point sixty five, and take profit three is at eight point fifty

if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do [Music]
thomas, trying to wake this, trying not to destroy my computer this morning
but the computers and the computer and the the microphone is pretty new
so, um, harder for me when it comes to computers to have patient than it is when i'm in the charts
so yesterday, i don't know if you saw my, my youtube video yesterday, because i showed you three different levels to where i could potentially see the market cooling back to wheat i and, uh, so which one huge scenario for bitcoin
and the scenario was that we came back up to the 12 hourly supply candle
can you see now why it's really important for us to go through? oh, my computer
so we came to the supply candle yesterday, which was this one on 12 hourly
do you remember what we spoke about couple of days ago when we had the back testing live stream? when it comes to supply and demand zone, what happened? the market did exactly do what we expected it to do against the supply candle
and we obviously had another fibonacci also that i spoke about
and this fibonacci level on the 12 12 hourly were only something that we would look at if we broke the supply zone
and the high of the supply stone was at 31 around, okay? exactly
okay? so the market pushed back up to this level, and then you saw this huge drop
so let's go down to the lower time frames and see exactly what happened
we come inside quickly, because remember, that's what happens when the mar i'm screaming, that is what happens
it is what happens when the market comes to either a supply zone or a demand zone, is that we just come very fast to retest it
and then you see either the drop or uh, the push up, right? depending on if it's supply or demand zone
in this case, we're looking at a supply zone, because the overall market is going down, right? and if you don't know, i mean, i, i do believe that we can come back down to twenty nine thousand, twenty six thousand nine hundred
now, on this fibonacci that i did have yesterday, take profit one almost got hit
um, but just to do a recap of what happened yesterday, i will show you, i didn't take a trade on bitcoin yesterday
i actually took trade on nas i had more, i do still have multiple positions
but you can see that i i've been looking at, um, this was some analyzes that i didn't have since yesterday
so, yeah, so we saw the market push back up to the to the supplying zone, and you saw the market then broke the support trend line
not the best, good looking support trend line, but this is just because i want to see the break of structure, right? and when the market, uh, broke this level
remember, when the market gives you a fake out, it gives you the fake out from the last resistance, comes back down, and then we see the read test bounce back down
it doesn't always have to be exactly you can see that i have a line here
but what we can do is that we take the help of the wicks right here, because the wicks is really important, for at least me to use
and also, it obviously depends on what, what time, um, what time frame you're using
but this is definitely something you can, you need to play around with it, because the market is, could be very volatile, especially um, you could see the market was very volatile here
and the other thing that we need to have in mind is that it's always zones, right? but the first clue was that we came back up and we tested the supply zone, you saw this huge, uh, bounce back down
if we also go to the higher time frames, what i did was that i took another fibonacci from the last high to the low
and the fibonacci levels, we were a a little bit above the 618 percent
because sometimes that happens, the market, um, doesn't respect it
because most of the time we usually see that the market is inside the fibonacci levels, and then you see the break
but this time you saw the market was consolidating above the 618 percent
but the clue that i did have was that we came back up and retested the supply zone, and then you based on the same fibonacci, take profit one almost got hit
and we're gonna, first of all, before i go in and see, um, exactly what can happen now, i want to see how it looks on on the xy
the last, technically, the last lower high that we did have here was, uh, this level at 102034
what did the market do? the market on the daily chart? cup two
but can you see that even if this is the daily the retest should be on the previous resistance, right? but the market did close
this candlestick closed above that level, which means that this could be the fake out to the downside
but another clue that we could have had is the fibonacci from low to high
and, uh, this is why, when dollars go up, bitcoin and other pair against usd usd go down
and that's why we also saw this huge bounce back down now on bitcoin
um, i'm very, i'm only very good when it comes to the technical and then i just realized, hey, yes, i know it was something, something that came out yesterday, but i don't remember exactly, whatever
i still go to, uh, my technical tools use it is very, very, very good
pantheon, it's, it's too late, but everything is to learn live with
how are you? how are ya? okay, so the best thing to do now, at least for me, is that i usually go to the higher time frames only to make sure
so these are the levels where i do believe that we can come back down to
and what i want to see is, where are we inside the market now? because when we're looking at the left right here, we don't have anything
we don't have a price that is closer than this price that we do have right here, around thirty one thousand one hundred
hello westy and [Music], if you slept 24 hours straight nothing happened in the market? what? i had the best positions on since yesterday
but we're also at a support, if we're using these wicks right? we're still at the support on the daily, uh, sorry, on the weekly
this is a very, in a very strong level that we need to break, and that is between, uh, 29 430 and 29 268
if we break below this level, and we could potentially see retest, that, for me, could be the beginning to take these next take profits at 27 870 and 26 843, up around these levels
i do believe that we need to come back down to 25 to 300, but on the lower timeframes
now, when it comes to bitcoin, because we are at a support now, we can definitely see the market give us a pullback
so we can see pull back up to potentially 29 724 and twenty nine thousand eight hundred and forty one
this is where i exp uh, we could see a market, i could see a a little retest on the lower time frames for then see the continuation to the push, uh, to the downside
oh yeah, these ones, these are crazy birds every summer, every summer
um, i would, i wouldn't do anything at the support, because i either wait for the market to give me a pullback to whatever level that is, or i'm waiting for the market to break the support
that would you have around 29, 880 or 90, for then a pullback and then continuation down
um, oh, what happened? and so, yeah, if you just use the fibonacci again, based on the support, based on another fibonacci, just to see the pullback, we came back inside the 1561 percent
and that could be where you see the market push up now a little bit and then drop
so that's what i i'm waiting for the market to either break the support or push back up, first of all, to 29 725 or 29 840, around these levels
um, we will go to nas because nas is, i'm inside some trades when it comes to nas
and i took my first entry yesterday at this high, at the 618 percent, around 12 766
take profit 2 at 12 330, and take profit 3 at 12 000 and around 50
take, uh, entry one, enter two and enter three for me on the lower time frames
i took the fibonacci from last high, from the push back down to the low
and i was obviously looking at candlesticks on the five minutes charts also
and when i took this trade, let's see, i think i did something like this
i'm not gonna say, i think, i know that i was, uh, what? it goes so quickly when we're looking at the lower time frames
this was, uh, when was this? is this now? no, this cannot be right
um, what we can see right now happening, market is right now inside
okay, on nas we can come back up to, uh, twelve thousand, um, twelve thousand five hundred and eighteen for a potential quick retest, and then see the continuation to the drop
so if that is the case, and this is i'm gonna go into another trade on us, because i already have multiple positions in it
looking at the higher time frames, we are, we were below a previous support
yeah, pull back up to these levels, and then potentially a reverse
let's see what we can find on ethereum, so i'm not gonna go through what happened
how are you? is everyone feeling good today? is everyone feeling good today? we had a holiday yesterday in sweden, so i took some time off the chart so i could celebrate the holiday, which i think can be really important sometimes

this is how you are supporting me and bitcoin senses, because this is how i am always available for you
and obviously, buy bit is really good when it comes to trading and swing trading, because when we hold our position for a longer time, it is the low fees that we want
okay, so you have the link in the description down below the video
and if you want to be part of bitcoin census community with natalie, you have the link to the to the uh, to the chat soon in in the live chat
so this is how you can be able to talk to other people about cryptocurrencies, and especially if you feel a little bit alone in your journey, because that's usually what happens when it comes to trading
and you can have more in touch with me, keep in touch with nat and her supportive community
so when we're looking at where where is the price? where is the closest price? and we broke below this previous support that we did have at 18 09, 1890
when it comes to ethereum and other other levels that we can look at to see where we could potentially come back down to, i would use the low of this week right here
can you see how perfectly this was? so this is why it's really important that can you see, we're using the clothes of the body
and when we go down to the daily chart, can you see how perfectly the market came back up and retested this level? and if we also drag fibonacci from the last low, uh, to the high, this is combined with the support that we did break, that we know that we potentially will retest
the market came back up, retested it, and then you saw the market drop
take profit one is soon about to get hit at one thousand seven hundred and fourteen
take profit two is at one thousand and six hundred, and take profit three is around one thousand five hundred
i mean, we just might have a a wreath test right now when it comes to ethereum
we can see a push now, if we're but if we, if we use the um fibonacci, i take it from 1768 to 1720
so could definitely be where the market only give you a pullback, and then you see the continuation down
because if we're looking at, if we're looking at the higher time frames, you see such a huge candlestick
and usually the market is not, you know, breaking up, you know, it's too volatile
so the market only does small pullbacks on the lower time frames, and then you see the market reverse back down
so this is definitely a level where i would look for an entry
and we are about to come into, when it comes to to nas now, we're just about to get into the level that i expect the market to come into for then reverse back down even more
so this is where we can, where i can add some positions, but i, yeah, so this other one was valid ah
[Music], oh, and the the t piece on my fibonacci is, uh, something that i bought many years ago
and i've said this before, but you don't know this, i don't share my fibonacci settings now, uh, because i bought it from another guy that is a really good trader
and i, with the respect towards him, i don't want to give him the, uh, his, uh, you know, parts of his academy for free on my own youtube channel
so this is why i don't share my settings with uh, when it comes to fame, now, i always need to respect other people's work
i will never give, and i mean, i help as much as i can, but taking other people's, uh credits and share them free, i would never do that
but i, i'm very interested right now when it comes to nas i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna lie
i'm just gonna total fam treyarch, i just saw the market right now on nas i added three other positions on us
i just to um, fix the stop loss in case the market would go local
okay, so we're about to get hit target one soon at 32 and 620 on the lower time frame
okay, so this is the thing, even if, okay, so overall, when we're, when we're looking at um, the market is in a heavy this was where we actually saw the bro break up structure
the market was going sideways for forever, and then eventually we broke the support
now, the first levels that i can see is retesting from is thirty two thousand seven hundred eighty eight and thirty two thousand eight hundred and seventeen go down to the lower time smasher, how are ya? i'm really good to mention it was really good
but if this is the case, take profit one will be at thirty two thousand six hundred and thirteen
take profit two will be thirty two thousand four hundred and eighty six
and take profit three will be thirty two thousand three hundred and um, hello moyaku
if that's the case, take profit one, two hundred seven to five
but the overall move, i still believe that we can come back down to the close of this week
so i do believe that this week needs to be filled at around 220
and if we combine it with the other fibonacci that we didn't have from this low
okay, you say, okay, if that, if that's how you feel, that's how you feel
i'm trying to find your, i'm trying to find your, i don't, i cannot see what you wrote
but i don't know why i did have the biggest zone in the whole wild world on the charts
i think daniel is referring to the news that binance over owners of being bitcoin are being prompted by the us
well, fibonacci is only is really good when it comes to finding levels, to see where the market goes when
um, i don't know what, what you guys want me to say, but when it comes to jasmine, but we are at the, we're at the low
i would just, i'm not gonna recommend anything, anyone to do anything
do we have anything else? i just don't want to see how it looks
let's see if this, if this will be where the market continues to go down from
it's just slightly below my entry, so we just have to wait and see
where we're looking at, i know we were looking at avox yesterday on the morning live stream
and we came back up and retested 2738, and then you saw the bounce back down
um, what i'm gonna do now, we're gonna change the trend line like this
and this is where we can obviously see the market bounce back up a little bit
um, or we only just might have, yeah, as a a small pullback now
so if we close below, if we start to see see some more momentum
um, this is obvious, obviously an energy i could have taken, but i don't trade avox
now, so if we break below this, uh, um, this previous support
um, this could take us back down to, potentially, um, take profit one is that? 2092
but as i told you, we are at a support and a previous, okay, oh yeah
if we break the support again, wreath could be a retest, but that will definitely take us back down to lower target
but if we only come back down to the support to create it as a support again, and we break the resistance trend line, that could be the when the market gives us higher, um, a bigger push to the upside, right? but we need to focus on this candlestick
and it's a very heavily candlestick, but meant that to a dog so we okay
this is why it's gonna be very interesting to see how this candlestick is closing in 17 hours and 13 minutes
because if we would see a candlestick looking some something like this, um, if we're closing above this preview support, and we close it with an inverted hammer tomorrow, we will probably be bullish again
so just because i think the market can come back down to lower target, it doesn't mean that this will happen now
the market just might need to pull back up to then pull back down, right? so that is why when i say, oh, i do believe the market will come back to 20 points in 93, it doesn't have to happen right now
this is long, long term targets, because the market, i don't know what the market, market's gonna do
do we need another retest against the resistance and then see the push back down? i have no clue though, but based on the huge drop that we did have yesterday, and the market still continues to give us highs because that is what the market is doing
so you can see the market do this against the support, because one touch to touch, third touch can be the push, right? but we also have to have in mind that we can break it retest, and that could be the continuation down
or the marking just might gonna be so boring that you just see them
you see it bouncing between these levels and then either reverse back down or up
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in this description down below the video
we came back, so this was something that we spoke about yesterday
this was, i think this was on the morning live stream that we didn't have
we saw the market, we saw the market pushed back up, and now you saw the drop
but we are at a support even on the lower time frames, going back in time, we can see, if we try to connect some dots together
and we also have have, uh, this acid previous support, support
and this is just my why you would see the market have trouble to break it
uh, the first thing that the first target that i'm gonna look at is a 3930 and 3941 to potentially see the market continue the movement to the downside
if we break that level, we can reach 3965 or 3983 for the potential reverse back down
if we see the market giving us higher target, uh, a bigger pullback, well, then we just might need to do something like this
so these are the ones that i the levels that i that i look for the market to reach, first of all
and we can also use a trend line, something like this on the 15 minutes chart
oh, i was, i was so honored to see that someone took it, took his time to do that
okay, what else? dot dot usdt, what are you guys gonna do today? i'm gonna go for a swim
but it's really this is something that i've also um realized how important it is to especially work out
i sit at the computer so much and focusing so much on the chart
we need to focus on other parts, right to we need to have a peace of mind when we look at the charts
either we see the market now retesting the 50, uh, at um, 909
if we see bigger pullback, because i still believe the market will continue back down, we can retest 920 or 921, 28
um, but first of all, this is the one that i'm that i look at
um, what? me? one hour swimming, 10 hours of sleep, double my lunch
guys, thank you so much for being on this livestream together with me
we got so many different social media so if you haven't already follow us there, you can go inside and do that
you have also the link to these social medias in the description
but every morning i also give out some content when it comes to tic toc, uh, tik tok and twitter
um, i think yesterday i spoke about, yeah, so this was the one that i spoke about yesterday
but i thought the market could pro if we broke the resistance trend line, this could take us back up to 2030
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that so you know when i am live next time, or have my daily updates

so if you want to be part of the community chat with me, you will have the link to that telegram group in just one second
and on this platform, or on this community, we share our knowledge and we so yesterday i told everyone that i i sold nas but i am not a financial advisor, never ever
and this is good for people that wants to that wants to communicate with other people that also like trading and crypto, of course
my name is josh, and over the past one day, we've seen a fake out play out in the bitcoin price, which i'll be talking more about in just a moment, alongside the fact that the ethereum short positions are approaching all time low levels, which i'll be talking about later in this video
and as i've been talking about over the past few weeks, when you're looking at the 1 000 day moving average, which is the green line, and the 200 week moving average, which is the red line, which are coming in at around 28 and a half thousand and around 223 k respectively
then technically speaking, right now the bitcoin price is relatively cheap compared to previous bitcoin bear markets and massive bitcoin crashes
because over the past decade of bitcoin's history, pretty much every single major bear market or major bitcoin crash, we've bottomed out at around these sort of moving averages, while the weekly bitcoin rsi has approached either oversold areas or very close to oversold territories
and obviously, over the past few weeks, we've been very close to this 1 000 day moving average, while the weekly bitcoin rsi is very close to oversold territories
so technically speaking, there is still some room to the downside here if you're comparing this to the 2018 bear market or the 2014 bear market
but instead, if you look at the march 2020 crash, even though we did dump down towards the 200 week moving average, the weekly bitcoin rsi, on the other hand, did not enter into oversight territories because that crash happened extremely quickly
and something else to keep in mind is the fact that we've already seen one week to the downside in between these moving averages, which was that 25k low
and something that is important to point out about that 25k low is the fact that at that time we had a massive meltdown in the crypto markets, obviously, with luna and usd collapsing
so you're talking about a project that was worth well over 40 to 50 billion us
dollars combined, that's completely collapsed, which is crypto's biggest meltdown that we've ever seen in history
and on top of that, during that same time, the lunar foundation guard sold 80 000 bitcoin, which helped further push the bitcoin price down to that 25k low
so just keep that in mind, all of that happening pushed the bitcoin price to 25k
so even though, yes, technically speaking, we do have some more room to the downside if we're basing this off previous bitcoin bear markets, but just keep in mind, we're probably gonna have to see something else happen, like, for example, the stock market keep dumping, or another major project collapse, in order for the bitcoin price to dump a lot lower than it has already, considering what has already happened
and so it's due to that reason as to why i'm simply dollar cost averaging into bitcoin at the current prices
and then, of course, if we see the bitcoin price reenter in between these moving averages, so basically below around 28 and a half thousand, and especially if we get any closer to the 200 week moving average at around 23k, approximately, then it's at those prices where i'm going heavier into bitcoin on top of my regular dollar cost averaging
and for those of you who were following me around a month ago, you would already know that i accumulated a lot of bitcoin down towards around 25 to 26 000, as i discussed here on the channel and also over on my twitter in real time
but anyway, just giving you a quick update on the daily bitcoin charts
looking at the bollinger bands, right now, they're basically in the same position as what they were in yesterday
so if you are new to this channel and you have no idea what this means for bitcoin, definitely check out my last video that i posted yesterday on the channel
and now taking a quick look at the short term bitcoin price action here on the four hour time frame
and obviously, you can see right here that within the last one to two days, we've seen another fake out to the upside, which is almost exactly like what we saw around a week ago
and once again, as i mentioned yesterday, this is why we need to see more confirmation of a break cut, such as a possible retest or breaking above the previous high
because, in fact, what i said yesterday when we were breaking out to the upside was, ideally we need to break above 32 and a half thousand in order to confirm more bullish price action
because otherwise, we simply do not have a lot of confirmation for these breakouts until we make higher highs, or if we see a successful retest, which means the bitcoin price coming back down to flip 30 700 into potential new support
and in that scenario, that would have further confirmed the breakout
but considering the fact we did not see that, obviously this turned out to be another fake count like what we saw around a week ago, once again
but once again, as i mentioned yesterday, we still have some shortterm support at around 29 and a half thousand due to this golden pocket
and other than that shortterm level of support at around 29 and a half thousand, we do have some more support at around 28 and a half thousand, which has been even more significant for the bitcoin price over the past three weeks or so
and beyond that level of resistance, we need to pay attention to these previous highs, which are coming in at around 31 and a half thousand approximately, and around 32 and a half thousand
but 325 k is even more important for bitcoin because, as i mentioned in my last bitcoin update video, there's quite a lot of sell orders placed at around 32 and a half thousand, creating strong resistance at around that sort of price level
because if you're taking a look at the nasdaq 100 index here on the daily time frame, basically over the past one and a half weeks, we've seen a lot of choppy, sideways price action
so yes, the larger trend here on the daily charts is still clearly a downtrend
but if you're looking at the immediate shorter term trends, we're looking somewhat neutral here over the past week or so, while we've just been chopping around sideways
and now taking a look at the ethereum to yours dollar chance on the weekly time frame, specifically, the weekly ethereum rsi, is extremely close to oversold territories
and in fact, right now, the weekly ethereum rsi is at its lowest level it's been at since the end of the 2018 bear market
so technically speaking, there is still some more room to the downside here
but relatively speaking, according to ethereum's history, the bottom is most likely closer than the top
but just keep in mind, when it comes to ethereum, we only really have one significant bear market to compare to
but other than the 2018 bear market, we could potentially compare this to what we saw in the second half of 2019, entering into early 2020, because that was also another bearish time period in the market
and speaking about what we saw for ethereum in late 2019, entering into early 2020, taking a quick look at the ethereum short positions on the bifidex exchange here on the weekly time frame, you can see here that in recent weeks, the short positions on the biffinics exchange have taken a massive decline
and in fact, these ethereum shot positions are getting extremely close to all time lows
the only other time where the short positions on this exchange for ethereum have been any lower than what we're at right now was during this time in the market, which was at the very end of 2019, entering into early 2020
and between now and then, the only other massive low in the short positions on this exchange for ethereum that we've seen was during the middle of last year, looking specifically at around june last year
and with that information in mind, taking a quick look at the weekly ethereum chart again to see what happens to the ethereum price during those times in the markets
and first of all, as a lot of you might already know, the middle of last year, specifically during june last year, was basically when the ethereum price was bottoming out, getting ready for another bullish move back to the upside in the coming months
but if you're looking at the time in the market where the ethereum short positions on the bifidex exchange were at their alltime low levels, once again, that was at the very end of 2019, entering into early 2020
during this time in the ethereum price action, which basically turned out to be an amazing buying opportunity, especially if you're holding for the longer term
because at that stage in the markets, the price of ethereum was beginning to bottom out at around 120 dollars per ethereum
and only just one year later, the price of ethereum had pumped by around 500 percent
and just two years later, the price of ethereum had pumped by around 3 000 now obviously, i'm not saying we're going to see the exact same returns for ethereum in the exact same amount of time
but what i am saying is these traders on this exchange, historically speaking, have been very accurate
because if you're looking at when most of the short positions were open most recently, that was between around november last year and basically around a month ago
and obviously, during that entire time period from november to early may, we saw a lot of bearish price action play out
which means these short positions were making a lot of profit
and then only around a month ago, in early may, after that crash down towards 1700, we've seen a massive decline in these short positions
over 300 million, nearly 400 million dollars worth of ethereum short positions closed ever since we hit that 1700 low, which is very interesting and definitely something to at least consider
and just taking a quick look at the daily ethereum charts, obviously this bullish divergence is still active and still in play
and what's great to see is the fact that the daily ethereum rsi is still in a fairly strong uptrend at the time of recording this video, which means we're due to see limited bearish momentum for the price of ethereum in terms of the daily time frame
and obviously this has been true over the past one and a half weeks
since we formed that bullish divergence, we haven't seen a lot of bearish momentum
and now giving you an update on the shortterm ethereum price action here on the sixhour time frame
technically speaking, we're still forming this symmetrical triangle pattern, as i discussed yesterday on the channel
and over the past one day, we have seen a nice bounce from this line of support, which is coming in at around 1740, approximately
but as for this rejection from this line of resistance, we did fall slightly short of that line of resistance because the resistance was coming in at that stage at around 1930, and instead we turned around at around 1920
but considering the fact that that's only a difference of just 10, this is still a valid line of resistance to pay attention to, which is currently coming in at around 1910 to 1920
and once again, this line of support is coming into play at around 1740 to 1750
and it's basically once we break one of those levels, that's when we potentially confirm the next major move for the price of ethereum
and i'll discuss the price targets in my last video on the channel
and just giving you a quick update for ethereum versus bitcoin here on the daily time frame
and over the past one day, this bullish divergence has potentially been saved
after yesterday, we were looking like this was potentially about to be invalidated, but technically speaking, we're still showing a higher low structure in the daily rsi
meanwhile, the ethereum price action versus bitcoin on the daily timeframe is still showing a lower, low structure in terms of the daily candle closes, which is an active bullish divergence
so at least as of right now, while this is on the chart, technically speaking, this does mean we're due to see reduced bearish momentum for ethereum versus bitcoin, at least in the somewhat shorter term, talking about the next few days, potentially even up to one to two weeks
but when it comes to ethereum versus bitcoin, we have to consider the bitcoin dominance, which is in a strong uptrend at the moment, which means this bullish divergence for ethereum vs bitcoin might not last as long as what we might think
and i wouldn't be expecting a major pump for ethereum vs bitcoin based on this alone
so for anyone that might be new to the channel, what this means is basically, in the somewhat shorter term, ethereum is holding up relatively well against bitcoin
but overall, ethereum is still in a downtrend against bitcoin
which means the larger trend at the moment is essentially ethereum underperforming against bitcoin
and this is also a pretty good indication of what the overall altcoin market is looking like, which at the moment, while the bitcoin dominance is in a strong uptrend, the old coin market is simply looking weak compared to bitcoin
but despite that being the case, if you check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen, you can actually maximize your profits in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so the bitcoin price is currently sitting at thirty one thousand four hundred and forty dollars
and we've had a very nice pump, uh, going through last night and into this morning
but the question is, will this pump sustain? is this a real pump, or is this just going to be a fake out? well, let's have a look at the charts
i'm going to quickly show you the invalidation levels, as well as carry off on what we covered on friday's video, which was a couple of chart setups that i was looking at
and i said, those charts, uh, or the setup at least, is not quite ready, but it's getting close to being ready, and we just have to give it a bit of time
i'm just going to throw in literally just one line over here, and that is the previous week's high
so if bitcoin manages to cross above that line over there, that horizontal, which is the previous week's high at 32 383, then i would say, okay, well, let's see, maybe this pump really is real
and there's going to be some major bounces leading up into this liquidity zone, which is coming in at around thirty seven thousand six hundred
so let's just see, should we be invalidated on our short term, uh, short bias, and we were to go to the upside, that could give us potential about a 16 move on bitcoin
altcoins, i'd imagine, would get a massive 20, 30 move off of that
you can't see, from an investor perspective, you do still have the weekly 21 ema trending down, which means that you probably shouldn't be in the market
uh, if you are an investor, you would have already exited quite a long time ago
you can see, if i zoom out and i just kind of show what's going on over here, we've got our diagonal trend line resistance, which is coming down
uh, for those of you, by the way, that say that this is small, i do understand that it's hard to read, which is why, straight after this video, these four hour charts, i am going to post on my twitter
if you go to the description below over here, you'll see all my links are over there
but anyway, nevertheless, we were stuck in this parallel sort of range over here
so essentially, what am i seeing over here? anything that comes into this area over here, in relation to the yellow circle on the left hand side, which is around 32 000, i would be extremely, extremely cautious on going long in that zone
and the reason why is because between here and here, you have the declining, uh diagonal, which will probably react as some sort of resistance over there
i would expect that there's a possibility of hitting straight into that and coming down
if you can't get back above that, that would be confirmed that we are probably going to be going lower
and now the setups, the actual setups, following on from uh friday, we have here ethereum
but it wasn't quite ready to enter, because at the time we were somewhere down here, i think, or maybe it was over here, uh
if we got anywhere close to this diagonal that's coming down, i would start to look for potential short opportunities
i'm not able to spoon feed people, unfortunately, when it comes to these kind of things, like, it's not really a calls channel where i'm giving exact entries stop losses and and all of that
but i am telling you that within this zone over here, you make your own determination of how you want to scale into trades
if you want to enter into parts, like i do, i enter into usually three parts
so it would be something like this, if i were to enter short trade, i'll take, for example, uh, one position maybe over here, another position over here
and as i get closer to my invalidation points, i'll get more aggressive
now, the actual only invalidation level is going to be at this area over here
i know that there is a diagonal, and we could wick right through that, but for me, diagonals don't hold as much weight as horizontals
clearing above this for ethereum, which is at two thousand one 2015
so the closer that you can enter to that level will make it big
so the closer you can enter to to that level, see change that again
the closer you can enter to that level, the better for your risk to reward ratio, right? so that's one option
and then the other option is over here, that would also be a good area to short from, is right onto that diagonal
if it were to reject, it's been acting as resistance throughout, then you have a good short opportunity
make this one big for you too, at 1 258, which is an enormous move
let's say, on average, you entered from in your short position, from there, that's literally 33 down from here
and you know what if you're wrong? well, you're hardly losing anything if you're wrong
let's see, what is your percentage over here? a three percent move that's why you need to control your leverage
so you need to determine exactly how much leverage you are going to use on that type of position
and the reason why is because your horizontal invalidation meets up much more closely to your diagonal line that you have over here
and i've been watching this this morning, i've noticed that it's been really struggling with this area
as soon as i get any sort of of a wick, even into this area, 45 and cents, i'll probably enter my first short opportunity over there
i'll enter my next short opportunity at 4683, and then my final one at 4816, with a very, very easy stop loss just above
if price were to get anywhere above that, i have written over here the invalidation on the short and the targets would be pretty much to new lows
i know it's hard for people to believe these prices, but i'm still looking at anywhere between 19 and 26
so for example, uh, first set of prophets here, second set of prophets there, and last set if you were to get there
and then i would convert those leverage trades into a spot position, going long from this zone over there
i would assume that it's going to be completely oversold at that point
it's at carldoops, again, if you have a look over here, uh, in the description below, you'll find all the links over there
you have a bibet referral as well, if you do want to support me
that is one way that, if you decide you are going to take any leverage trades, make sure you have a backtested plan so you don't get wrecked
on the 4hour chart with my, this is my other chart over here with my emas you can see, price is coming up to the 200 ema on the four hour with, uh, stokes as well, getting to the upside
so if it rejects off that, and those stokes turned down, i'd imagine that, uh, my other thesis, on the other long, the other charts that i've shown you are going to be correct
you have ethereum, you have that, that, um, 200 ema, coming down a little bit higher than then on bitcoin over here
and then you have solana axellana's got that one's coming up at 54
so just correspond that to the other charts that i showed you
i definitely will be completely transparent and let you know if i am entering into any short trades
for the moment, you're gonna analyze bitcoin, rest of the markets
what happened yesterday? we were taking a look at two scenarios here, okay? which was the adam and eve double double bottom scenario, okay? where we had a nice spike over here, and the round formation, getting this reaction from this level
the possibilities in creating a descending triangle and actually going lower was also there
but this was a no trade zone for me, because we had two possible scenarios, which was, you know, getting that rejection here from this 618 level here, where we did touch
i did a quick scalp there, and, you know, the consolidation, you can see that reaction that we did have at the 618 level
the possibilities in creating a lower high and still forming this descending triangle was there
but we had also a very high probability of this double bottom scenario
we were having such a large consolidation here on bitcoin that the possibilities were there
okay, this is why i did not make any day swing trade here, because the possibilities in going up or down, you know, they were almost 50 50 for me
and, you know, this double bottom, adam and eve, was just so, so possible
now, what could happen next for bitcoin? i want to talk about the strongest levels that we do have here on btc
big, big, major level here, where we have been talking about this range over the last few days
now, if we do come down here and consolidate, just like we did here at this level, if we do manage to get that pull back and consolidate
this might be a very good longing opportunity round about the thirty thousand, six hundred dollar range, only if we do have that consolidation, because we can absolutely slice through this level
okay, remember, guys, we're looking at these levels as potential consolidation, potential stops
but you just imagine if you thought, okay, this is huge, huge level, right? this is a huge, huge level
so if we do come back up here, it's very likely going to get rejected
you need to wait, be patient and see what kind of reaction the price has to take that risk, take that opportunity
now, i can tell you one thing right over here, a reason why we are getting this consolidation, that we are getting this stop here, at this level, at this moment
all right? it's not a guarantee that we are going to come down
if we do come down and consolidate with low volume, then it might be an opportunity
now, we could actually come all the way up to the 32 000 range
so, um, what i wanted to show you here is, you know, the reason why we did get a stop, because we are getting a small stop here
looking at the two hourly, looking at the one hourly, and, you know, you need to take a look at the levels
we did actually consolidate at this support level for quite some time, the 31 300 area, all right, where we were trading here on the 31st of may, also the first of may here, getting these stops at this low level
so that is reason number one, okay, why you're getting this stop at this range
reason number two, you probably guessed it, right? from this high to the low, you're actually hitting that 61865 level fibonacci retracement
all right, let's see what happens in the next couple of hours
because if you start creating a kind of a small double top here on the one hourly, a couple of weeks a couple of attempts to break this zone here at the 31, 300, 350 area, then it's very, very likely you will be getting that pull back
also, if you do consolidate from this 30 600 range, we can look for that leg up
the textbook technical analysis target from this double bottom, all right, is getting the width of the double bottom scenario
you got the atom, nice big peak, down, back up again, and then the round consolidation right here, being the eve, okay, giving that nice accumulation for that big spike to the upside
now, the projected move, we did talk about it yesterday, the projected move is getting the width, okay, from the breakout
so we could expect, you know, that 32 000 range for bitcoin, potentially in the next coming hours, or maybe, you know, a couple of days, if we do get that pull back in consolidation
i do see some people that, you know, this is just big, a big, massive dead cat bounce, and, um, and we're gonna go to much lower levels
well, we are seeing some kind of strength, all right? we are seeing some kind of strengths
and, yeah, the the reason why i think, you know, we could actually go to 32 000 and actually break this zone is because, you know, we have broken above this major resistance area
you know, this was the opportunity of bitcoin right over here, to have that big, massive, you know, correction from this point
all right, this is kind of a distribution looking at the one hourly
but, you know, this is like the the spring point, right? where you do have that big, massive fake out trap a lot of, um, long traders, and then you have that big, major correction to continue back down
so, you know, if you do start getting to this level again, you know, this is, this is pretty bullish
this is pretty, you know, you can actually break the zone because this was the trap zone
is there going to be a second trap? will there be a second trap here at 32 000? well, it's very unlikely
it's very likely that if we start hitting 32 it is here to break the zone
you know, how many traps can you have? let me go through the comment section right away
uh, yesterday, i remember asking in the poll you know, is this a double bottom, and are we going to go to 32 000 levels? and i think about it was about 65, no, 59, 60 of people were saying yes
so there was more people bullish yesterday, you know, with this a double bottom, more people were bullish
seen, you know, where i asked, i asked this in the comment section when we were trading at this level, at thousand one hundred dollar range approximately, you know, looking for that double bottom
you know, are we on our way to thirty two thousand dollars? about sixty percent of people said yes in the poll
i did not take any long i got stopped out of my short position, of course, that i had in break even from these levels
i do have about 20 of my long hair that i did have just below 29 000
i'm still in this long because i do see, you know, that potential leg up to 32 000
and then, you know, i will be taking some more profits, of course, from this long and then, you know, potentially i'm going to leave it
i think, you know, there's a high possibility that we might break it
i want to explain also here, zooming out, right? remember, guys, we've had a huge, huge, aggressive drop
it's been absolutely insane, from forty eight thousand dollars all the way down here to twenty thousand 000, almost
so, you know, that relief rally to 35k, 36k, it's just very, very possible
guys, you know, the trend is your friend, of course, and we are going to the downside, but the possibilities and bitcoin, you know, going up to these levels, 35k, you know, 36k is very, very high, uh, because of the massive, big drop we've had
all right, there is a possibility that you might see that leg up now
of course, if we start trading at this range and consolidating, we do have very, very strong levels that we'll be talking about
okay, if we do have some time here on the live stream, that 35 000 is a major monthly level
it's also a major daily level here, as you can see, this is on the daily chart
but if you take a look at the vpvr, and this is absolutely insane, if you take a look at the volume trader, look at this, you know, the big spikes
this is looking at the volume traded for the last five, six months
there's hardly any volume traded for the last, you know, six months in between 30 000 and 38 000
it was a fast move to the downside, so it can be a fast recovery here
and then obviously looking for those big, major resistance levels for potential continuation to the downside
longed on btc? uh? is it good? we're all depending on where you longed
i mean, if you're looking for long positions at this level, it is a little bit um
why are we hitting resistance? because we're hitting this major consolidation area, as you can see
okay, from this kind of diamond reversal pattern, if you wish
i've also showed you, you know, it was, it is the 618 from the top here of the start of the drop
we are hitting that six one eight level, as you can see here on the chart
getting that consolidation with volatility, the possibilities in getting a rejection back down to thirty thousand six hundred dollar area
a great trading opportunity for me would be correcting down to this level and getting a small consolidation with very low volume
so if i take a look at volume, if i take a look at volume right now, we do see, you know, there has been some, some power here, right? there has been some power compared for the last week
but you know this, we've had some volume breaking this major zone
and if we start correcting, if we do start correcting, and we have low volume here and a consolidation here with low volume, this is gonna, you know, this is telling me that it's very, very likely going to get a pump
so i'll be waiting patiently for for that scenario, for a potential long opportunity
have you seen what's going on with north and south korea? uh, this is going down
i don't pay too much attention to the news, but, um, yeah, opportunities are always there
we want to have some opportunities and take advantage of the market
why not? i mean, i do see us getting rejection from this zone
we probably should be hitting 32 000 because of the potential projected move from this double bottom
okay? as you can see, back in the 31st and 1st of june, we are hitting that important 618 fibonacci retracement here from this drop, as you can see, getting that consolidation from this major zone, you know, the probabilities here in getting that correction, at least to the 30 600 is very, very possible
all right, on the one hourly, it would be nice the next few hours, you know, to have potentially this kind of movement and a potential leg up and then a failed attempt
if you have one more leg up and you fail to break the highs here at 31 400, then, yeah, this is very likely gonna have that, that correction
if we do get one leg up here during the live stream and then come back down, i will very likely, uh, this is potentially a shorting opportunity
okay, to to this level, to this strong, strong level, the 30 600, 30 700
and of course, if you do create a big, massive wick come down, then, of course, you know, stoploss above the wick, you know, get into the next leg up, and then look for that position
immediate short term stakeholders, we need, we need to remember that we are in a very aggressive downtrend
i do see higher levels, but this is we are remember, we are in an aggressive downtrend, and we need to zoom out on the four hourly
and we need to understand, you know, that we are still in an aggressive, aggressive downtrend
so, yeah, if we do take a look at the alltime high here and make a trend line, uh, i'll tell you what, let's go to the this is the thing
you know, the possibilities in coming actually, to that 35 000 range and slightly higher
we did get that beautiful bounce wicking below we were talking about, you know, this relief rally, uh, for a long, long time
because remember, guys, the weekly chart showing the volume indicates a local bottom
it is very likely to indicate a local bottom like we have seen in the past
we had here, may of 2021, big spike in volume right over here
all right, this is not the moment to be bearish, of course, at these low, low levels
you know, you should be bearish here to ride this all the way down here
is it? is it clever to be bearish at the very, very low of a big, massive multimonthly drop? of course, it's not
i know, i know it is hard, because you're going down aggressively, and we aren't a downtrend
but yeah, i mean, looking at this, you know, volume indicating the potential low here, it was pretty, pretty good
so, uh, anyway, look, what i wanted to say, you know, you know, that possibility and actually retesting the trend line here from these lower highs is is very, very possible
you know, in the next couple of weeks, that would be round about the 35 000, if we were to get up there, you know, in between this week and next week
um, yeah, we will very likely get rejected from this trend line, we will also be hitting, you know, uh, major, major levels here on the chart
if we do get that leg up, you know, it might be a moment to be bearish if we start consolidating here at the 35 000 range, you know, in the next few days, you know, one week or so
i know a lot of people, i want to ask the community, are you i'm going to ask the community, because i am personally a little bit bullish in the short term
okay, uh, i do see a possibility in breaking this, you know, supply zone, uh, that we do have here, and and actually having a few legs up
look how fast we came all the way down, from 35 000, all the way down to 31 000, uh, dollar range
you know, i've seen it before so many times on a chart, when you move fast down or up, okay, from a zone, you can move as fast, okay, the other side
a lot of people will be surprised if you see a massive, big leg up, you know, to 35 000 range or so, because they'll be thinking, wow, what's happened to bitcoin? why is it pumping that much? because there's basically, you know, you had a fast move from this zone
you have hardly any volume profile, as you can see here from the, from the volume traded, you know, the last five, six months, we have a big gap in volume from this area
it is going to be the release, relief rally, um, that it is going to have some continuation to the upside
are we gonna have a pullback first, and then have that leg up? uh, possibly, yes
we're probably going to have that leg up in the next coming hours
are you bullish on bitcoin for the next couple of weeks? i would say, are you bullish? bullish on bitcoin next couple of weeks
um, because if we do zoom out, you know, the possibilities of a higher relief rally is is very possible
um, especially when we are seeing this momentum breaking some major levels
if we start hitting this range, uh, this is for me, for me right now, this is not a double top area, you know, this is not, it's not the kind of pattern that you would create a double top
if we do hit this, hit this range, it is very likely going to get broken
um, because this is a, this is a kind of a spring point, right? this is kind the, the the ball trap to actually have continuation to the downside
but if you do come back up and reclaim this range, it is very, very possible to be broken, guys
any uh, anyway, here everyone, my crypto legends, andy scout king? yeah, i'm not a scout king at all
let's take a look at ethereum 1900 range, where we do have, we can take a look at the dxy
it is struggling, you know, after breaking this zone we did got, we have this big resistance at the 102, 10250, getting that rejection from this zone
you know, if the dx y starts dropping from this level, we are going to see a bigger relief rally on bitcoin
okay, so if the b dx y does have a kind of an abc correction and goes to much lower, this will be very good for bitcoin
we'll be seeing bitcoin having that bigger relief rally, uh, in the next coming couple of weeks
ethereum is at the 1900 it is lagging very much behind bitcoin, but it is having, of course, that bullish momentum, uh, when bitcoin pumps, of course
it is probably going to get rejected, rejected from this range
if ethereum does manage to get above this level, it's going to be looking pretty, pretty good for ethereum
you know, we might see, uh, ethereum going as high as 2150, the high of the zone of this range, this range that we have been for an entire month, okay, from the 12th of may, approximately after the drop recording at the 6th of june
yeah, if we do see bitcoin having that bullish momentum, of course ethereum will follow
if you solidly break up, then any correction from this range is very, very likely going to have another leg up, breaking important trend line, lower highs
you know, you have created this kind of double bottom scenario here
uh, especially if bitcoin does help, you know, if we do see bitcoin having that bullish momentum ethereum will uh, also, of course
how are you doing? ben? one of my strong, one of my strongest supporters, always do giving a comment on my daily videos
what's up? my scalping legend says, bernie, how are you doing? uh, ema, 200 on the four hourly, coming right on
uh, andy jerome says, bearish bat about to complete for a possible retrace
uh, is this? um, i need some more is it? is this on bitcoin? is it? what time frame? is it on? bearish bat about to complete, right? is this? this is not here, of course, because you're not creating a higher low
we don't have a higher high here, a higher low, sorry, or a lower low
so there's no harmonic pattern possible in this area, because you basically created at the bottom
is this on the one hourly, 30 minute? what time frame? i do not see any bat pattern here
remember, for harmonic patterns, you need a higher high or a slightly, um, sorry, a higher low or a lower low
the drop needs to happen in the next few days, because, if if not, it's not going to be, yeah, i'll be getting stopped out
if you are interested in trading, you know, different commodities on prime xbt, you get seven percent added to your deposit
and you're using bitcoin as collateral, or ethereum, or stable coins, if you wish
if you want to trade gold, natural gas, s p 500, using crypto guys, no, kyc required
you know, natural gas here, it's kind of holding by a thread from this major uptrend, right? we did have, here, looking at the daily, a wick to the downside, but it is holding this kind of aggressive uptrend
but i, you know, like i showed you on many, you know, most of the, you know, smart investors were long on natural gas here, you know, before this, well, you know, this event that is happening, you know, with ukraine and russia
um, we do have the in march, you know, the gas prices, you know, doubled in price in just a couple of months
so is this going to go to higher levels? i mean, it is possible
and when you see these slightly higher highs, this does look like a kind of a distribution event that could happen
all right? you know, if we start breaking these highs, then, yeah, that will be the end of that
but the risk to reward here for the a potential larger correction on natural gas before we consolidate and maybe go to higher levels, of course
we've been, you know, a couple of months already at this range, from the, uh, 14th of april, approximately at this level
uh, a couple of months are already is enough for a distribution, and it's just holding by a thread from this range
i showed you this on a, on a live stream not not long ago, about this, you know, potential distribution on gas
and, um, yeah, i mean, i know most of the people are are bullish, right? most of the people, you know, prices are still going to skyrocket
i do think it will in the next coming months, few years, of course
but for the moment, i do see a potential correction on natural gas
you know, these slightly higher highs, uh, is telling me that we are, uh, gonna have a correction, potentially down to six dollar or five dollars, between six and five
of course, this is going to take maybe a few weeks till we potentially have that correction
can you check please? says scotty, let's take a look at solana
remember, a lot of these old coins, you know, we can see ethereum, also having aggressive lower highs
there will be a moment, you know, here, at this range, 45, 46 range, we're gonna start hitting some major, major resistance
so you basically long to the breakout, or just about before the breakout
this was mentioned on yesterday's live stream, big, big zone here of support and resistance level
as you can see, the price stopping from this range, the possibilities and actually creating a lower high is also very possible
remember, we got an aggressive downtrend lower high and a big, big resistance level at 48
so if you start hitting 45, 47, you know, and you long from this range, it's, it's a definitely a take profit zone
you might be getting some wicks and some consolidations to continue back down
so if you longed here, you know, i would definitely consider protecting my position, um, just in case you do create that, you know, that lower high, you must be above six one eight levels here
from this drop, just about at the six one eight range, six five fibonacci retracement, getting that reaction a little bit
can we go higher? yes, the higher we go here at the 45 47 range is where we have massive, massive resistance
like i showed you, we've got the lower high trend line here, okay, from the lower highs
so it's a definitely a take profit range, because you could see that fake out volatility and continue back down, if you if we solidly break here this zone on solana, the 48, wow, this is going to be looking pretty good
very likely we're going to go to the high of the zone here at about 60 in the next coming days, especially if we do see bitcoin having that bullish momentum, you know, breaking thirty two thousand dollars
then, yeah, we're going to see some pretty nice pumps on on bitcoin if we do break successfully the 32 000 range
and of course, some altcoins will be having some big relief pumps
if bitcoin pumps and bitcoin dominance goes up, you know, look at this
if we start seeing bitcoin pumping and the bitcoin dominance, you know, after a huge rally for the last few weeks, bitcoin pumps and the bitcoin dominance starts having a small correction for the next couple of weeks
this is if bitcoin breaks 32 000, starts, you know, having some bullish momentum for the next coming weeks, uh, and bitcoin dominance goes down a couple of percentage
and what usually happens to the people is, you know, wow, this is going to absolutely skyrocket
we are very likely going to have some kind of sideways action and a potential correction, you know, the next few weeks on the bitcoin dominance, especially when you're going from 40 all the way up to 47 in just a matter of a few weeks
if we do get that correction, and bitcoin goes up, potentially to 35, 36 000 range, which i do think, you know, can happen
the charts are telling me that, yes, uh, possibilities are higher right now
you know, you are going to see ethereum, you know, this breakout and coming up here to retest the 150
solana, having that bullish momentum also, you know, this is just, everything points out that this can happen
this is, uh, and you can see here, the charts are telling me, you know, solana, look at this
um, we got the bitcoin dominance ready for the correction? if bitcoin goes up and bitcoin dominance goes down, this will be huge for the altcoins
what all coins do we want to focus on more? of course, the top 20, the top 30, they're the ones that are going to have the larger relief pump
and this is, of course, you know, if we do see that correction on the bitcoin dominance, it's gonna be a much larger pump
if you're long in here, if you are longing solana, stay cautious
of course, if you go, if you did get in here at these low levels, stay cautious
and now that you're in a profit and, you know, think that you're gonna, you're gonna absolutely moon from this level, protect your position
you know, most importantly in trading is protect your capital
so if you are in a profit, you know, the biggest mistake here is to still have your stop loss down here
if you get stopped out, and you consolidate at this range, you always have time to get back into a trade
you know, i've made so many mistakes on on being in a profit and ending at a loss in the end from a winning trade
protect your position at all costs, especially if you are, you know, if you've already pumped, you know, five percent or so 10, it's not worth, you know, take some profit
um, so, yeah, of course, if you entered at this double bottom on solana, even better
i'm not sure if many people would did enter 35, 35 range here
but, yeah, that double bottom here was pretty, pretty nice also
um, uh, let's take a look here in the comment section right away
can you please take a look at gmt? can you please do some live trading for us? says scotty, absolutely
i mean, if i do see the opportunity, of course, i would do live trading
like i said, why is there a day trade? why is there a potential shorting opportunity at this level? because we are heading a major consolidation level
we are heading, we are hitting resistance the 31st, the 1st of june, we add big resistance, as you can see here on the chart
getting that volatility, okay? you don't, you you don't usually stop at the exact dollar and turn around
i mean, if anything, there there is a shining opportunity right there
i would like to see a little bit of more price action, because you could get that leg up to here
could you correct down here? yeah, this would be a missing trade
but you know, if you do consolidate and have one more leg up, you know, then, yeah, that this is going to be a sign of weakness, and you're going to have that move down
you know, you can have a tight stop loss and and the risk to reward, you know, is pretty large
let's see if we do get, you know, a little bit more consolidation
why not gmt? what's going on with gmt? is it pumping? is it dumping? what's going on? um, right
and like i said on gmt, is that we, we did form this descending triangle that met the target really, really nicely from the breakout here, creating this double bottom
what is happening right now here on the large time frame, is that we are forming a larger descending triangle
so a relief rally here on um, all the way up here to around about the 125 area is very, very possible
this is a very, very strong resistance level, because you do have big support
so it's a, it's a major level to pay attention to because, um, there is a possibility in breaking this level
if you do break this zone, you know, high probability trade, the highest probability trade here on gmt is not shorting this level, because you are getting supported from this range, right? you are getting those bounces
if you do break this lower high trend line, and you do break the two, the 125, successfully, with some pretty nice volume, it is very, very likely you are going to see that leg up on gmt to round about the 170 only
if you break successfully this 125, there will be good training opportunities the next coming days
if that does happen, um, there's a major trading opportunity if that does happen, if you break successfully the zone, of course, you got another double bottom scenario right over here, right there
another double bottom you are looking for, that projected move
you do have a trading opportunity here for that projected move
we can see that bullish momentum in the next coming days to hit that 12125
primix bt has 4x, has s p 500, has crude oil silver, you name it
they have a bunch of assets, okay, that you can trade using bitcoin as collateral, ethereum or stable coins, which is absolutely huge
but you can trade forex here using bitcoin as conadero, which is absolutely great
remember, you've got an insane bonus down below of seven percent added to your deposit for primex
says arson here today, after checking the 200 sma 2 hour for our daily really good day
i've been taking a look at the news here, and we do not have, you know, today, monday, there's nothing too aggressive
there is some news here in australia tomorrow, but, um, yeah, nothing too important
monday, tuesday or wednesday, we don't have really any big news
so this is, i think it's pretty good for some potential bullish momentum
stock market also looking bullish, but be careful with the stop loss
absolutely, arson here, saying that, you know, it looks pretty promising for for bitcoin to have some more bullish momentum
you know, this was mentioned yesterday, you know, i said i was going to be leaning slightly bullish for the next coming days, couple of weeks
if we do break this 30 600 range, it's been a strong, strong level
and what usually happens, you know, with this bull trap, you know, you don't get ball trapped three times
this was the moment for that, you know, redistribution still to to to continue
uh, if you get closer to this zone again, it's very likely gonna gonna break it
uh, at this moment, of course, after creating this the bottom and breaking the zone
so if we do get that correction, i do see a a good training opportunity at this range
let's see, what happens here? are we going to have another failed attempt? this is the moment
let's go to the 30 minutes i will potentially look for a day trade
is it going to fail? is it going to fail breaking this zone? i think so
it is almost here for the next 15, 30 minutes, you know, to decide for a potential short
this is the moment, you know, if we do see something like this, it is the moment to jump in a trade for that for that leg down
it says, are you bullish on bitcoin next couple of weeks? and 64 of people say yes
you know, as soon as we break this zone, this uptrend here, from higher lows, we got a really large support level that was broken and retested as resistance
you know, i could we see some bullish momentum here on on the dxy, to create a lower high, yes, but it's looking pretty bearish
we we are getting that rejection from this, from this major, strong level
if i go to the daily, remember i talked about this lower high trend line on the dxy, where we do have, you know, the highs from the from 2016, the highs here from march of 2020, just before the big, massive drop on the dollar
you know, getting the resistance from this trend line, also, the multiyear lower high trend line
if you go to the four hourly, you can see we got supported from that trend line right over here, and we're actually getting resistance from the train line also here
i mean, it is possible the xy can be bearish for the summer, for the next coming weeks
it will ignite bitcoin to to to break 32k, of course, and go to 35, 36, 36 k during the summer
so, yeah, i've got 64 of people being bullish in the comment section
andy, uh, andy, i know why i took a loss today? i forgot to take my vitamins
says, ash what weekly we closed the weekly candle close yesterday? uh, let me just go to the weekly
yeah, we added an inverted hammer here and pumped straight away
hey, andy, i watched every day, and i think you are entertaining youtuber
let me take a look here through the comment section, and let's take a look at some altcoins
uh, can you and can you do analysis on astar, please? says thiago, uh, absolutely, yeah
legislation for cryptos? yeah, this is on the seventh, this is on the 7th of june
legislation for crypto is on the seventh of, um, of june, which is tomorrow, actually
let me, um, [Music] zoom out on the weekly we've had a massive, big drop when was this launched? it seems like this was launched not long ago
we do have something here on kraken, yeah, not much, not much price data here to analyze the chart with them
this looks pretty bomb promising for for a potential bottom here
okay, we did our we did lose the lows here from january of 2022
you know, this does look like, you know, it is ready to bottom out, you know, a kind of a large, massive double bottom also at this range, as you can see here on the chart
and it looks ready to actually retest the eight cent level again, on a star
uh, not much to add here on on this one, actually, it's a very volatile crypto
this is why you do see these funny little gaps on the candlesticks
but it looks pretty good to have a leg up to retest here the 85 level again
it is very, very possible creating a nice, higher double double bottom, higher, low, right there
this is an ascending and ascending kind of triangle, basically, right where you are getting some buying pressure
um, yeah, live trading, only if there is an opportunity, of course
you know, this is the thing, you know, we're still in a pretty large momentum to the upside here
of course, ascending channels inside of this range are usually bearish probabilities in getting a correction from this range
but we've just, you have, only just a few minutes ago, created the higher high
so, yeah, shorting here is a little bit too risky at the moment
ideal scenario here would be starting to break here, the higher lows on the short shorter time frames, shorter time frame here
you know what? the ideal scenario here would be breaking the zone, having another leg up
this is the level you want to short when you start going sideways and start seeing some bearish action
um, that would be the ideal scenario, breaking this higher low zone
this would be the ideal have one drop and not short the drop, short the actual last leg up here, for that another failed lower high, for that correction
yeah, i wouldn't be looking for a short there, because, you know, you could still, we are still in in this uptrend
you know, this could break resistance, but it's a shorting opportunity in the next coming hours
remember, 618 from this high to the low, you are consolidating at this range, and you're hitting the low support level from the volume traded from 31st of may until the 1st of june
i'm so patient to get into a long, pers into a long or a short
you remember where i, you know, where i shorted here? um, i shorted right over here at this peak, before a live stream
i just entered the short before the live stream, you know, because we had this failed, you know, the failed moves to the upside
we were very, very much waiting for this correction at this level
this was so, so, such a good trading opportunity right there that we were talking about, since we were all the way down here, this is why i remain in my lung from from down here, i still remain part of a percentage on my lung is still open, of course
i mean, this was, it was, that was pure technical analysis, guys, pure technical analysis playing out to perfection, looking for that long, looking for that lego consolidation, and another lego for that liquidity grab at this level
it was just pure technical analysis working to perfection there
i'm gonna take this short because a massive, big pump into an ascending channel
um, for that breakdown here from the zone, at least coming to the 30 800
how do you dare to short my largest cryptocurrency in my portfolio? chain link
uh, it's, it's not a bad short, actually, it's not a bad short here on chain link
[Music], i don't know if if bitcoin continues bullish momentum, i mean, this could have a much larger relief rally, eh? you know, look at the drop from april to may
you know, just one month ago we were trading below at twenty dollars
i don't know, i i'm not, i'm staying away from all coins at the moment
it's enough for me to trade bitcoin and some other commodities, maybe ethereum, but, yeah, i don't need to um trade any any other ones
[Music], you mean, you're shorting the very, very bottom of a big, massive downtrend
you know, this is, is it the moment to short here? is it really the moment to short? or was this the moment to short? or was this the moment too short? i don't know
i'm already saying, you know, if this is going to pump, you know, we are at a very low level
i am highly emotionally attached to chain link, because i have a large position in my portfolio
so this is, you know, if you are highly attached emotionally to, um, to an asset, don't trade it
[Music], what is what is options in trading? what is options in trading? well, oh, i don't do options, but, uh, options is basically, you know, it's a kind of, how would i explain options in trading? i would, i want to do a, i should actually do a video apart from this
but you are basically, you know, it's like um saying that you are, you know, chain link
i say that chain link, by the end of the month, is going to be at nine dollars
is it gonna be above nine dollars, or is it gonna be below seven? dollars
and basically, you put a put or a coal on on, on, on the trading pair to it's basically, i say it's going to be above a level or below a level, and then you get paid if the price is above that certain range
i will get a video on on that, uh, but it's hard to explain right now on the live stream
but i do want to do, um, i would like to get a video on what is options trading? i actually never do options
let's take a look at, uh, andy, can you have a quick look at gold? absolutely
i actually, um, i actually did place a live long on gold because we found this bat pattern
let's take a look at the daily i think gold will be trading at 1 920 in uh, in in the next few days, maybe one week or so
i mean, i've got the long heat on primex bt, uh, long to go that 1 843
we have a very strong uptrend on gold, as you can see on the daily
i mean, the probabilities on on us actually getting a bounce from this level, uh, to the 1920, i think it's very, very, very, very high probable
we've got a beautiful back pattern here that is actually playing out pretty, pretty good
i do think that another leg up in the next coming days on gold is very, very likely
let me show you here quickly, this this back pattern here that we we have had
there we have a bat pattern that should be taking us all the way up to round about the 1920, which is the 50 618 fibonacci range, the 618, sorry, 618 would be the first target from c to d
i think one one thousand nine hundred and twenty dollars is very much achievable on gold the next coming days
okay, if you short bitcoin, what leverage do you use? well, i won't gonna, i'm gonna say what kind of leverage i use
when it's above 15x, i am looking, it's more for a scalp day trade
of course, if it's all coins, i would go much lower in leverage
swing trading on on all coins, you know, even a 3x, because, you know, they're more volatile
so a 3x for a swing trade on altcoins is is very good for day trades, maybe a a 6, 7 x
and for scalping, you know, a 10x already on altcoins is is pretty, pretty high leverage
so, yeah, this is what i say, swing trade on bitcoin in between four and, between four and seven x, approximately, from seven x to twelve x would be day trades
uh, just a quick, you know, this is what i use, approximately
i've got four video tutorials bitcoin on on cryptocurrency, on buybit
i do explain it, how margin trading works, because some people are used to margin trading
some people are used to isolated trading where you just have the x's, okay, which is easy to calculate
of course, if the market moves one percent and you're using a 10x, then your position moves 10 right
i do have a full video tutorial on primexpt, so you can understand how this works
okay, if you are experienced, also, you got an insane bonus, but you don't have to use it if you want
but check out the full video tutorial on how margin trading works
margin trading is totally different than isolated, um trading
i do explain it in the full video tutorial on primax bt, down below, if you want to check it out
okay, because all of these questions are answered on the tutorial, i've got, uh, timestamps also there, so you can go directly in the difference
all right, i've got a timestamp showing you the difference of margin trading and isolated trading
mark dutch giving the the video tutorial primex bt in the comment section
ask me, karam abu, is there a difference between opening a 100 trade on 10x and a 50 trade on 20x? both are valued 1 000 trade, so it should be the same, right? this is a very, very good question, karam
let me just, um, let me just get a btc chart here one second and get, i'm going to try and explain this as fast as i can
let me go here to the one hourly chart, and just just take a look at the situation
they are both valued at one thousand dollars, but there's only one difference
you know, if the price action at a 10x leverage, you say you're long here, you long here, one at 100, long position at 10x
the only problem is, here is your stop loss, okay? your profits and losses
so if you're using a 10x and the price action of bitcoin moves, i'm gonna have to zoom out a little bit here
if the price action at a 10x moves 10 to the downside, oh, my goodness
if the price action moves 10 to the downside, then your position is moving 100, if that makes sense
so if the price action does move 10 to the downside, this means that your position moves 100
if you, if you have, um, if you have a 20x leverage and your position moves um, if your position moves 10 percent, then your position is moving 200 percent
so you just need a, you just need a 5 move to get stopped out, basically
okay? your liquidation price is getting hit, if that makes any sense
um, basically, your stop loss, it your liquidation price is much, i got my dog here, bark
um, basically, your liquidation price, your liquidation price is much closer from your entry price
okay? if you're using a 10x leverage, okay, your liquidation price is going to be much, far away from your entry okay, your liquidation price might be right down here, if you enter a trade here
if you're using a 20x leverage, your liquidation price is going to be much closer from your entry
the higher the leverage, the closer the liquidation price is at your entry
okay, so this is why you're, you know, it's very, very dangerous, just in case you do get that volatility, basically
my missus already has opened the door, so i was just it's maybe amazon
um, be careful to use stop loss when trading high leverage, since liquidations occur before your position gets to a hundred percent
liquidations are usually, you know, if you have a position here and your liquidation price is here, it is usually eighty percent of your position, it is, and they take away a hundred percent
this is the thing i sometime, you know, sometimes you might put your stop loss at 80 percent of your position, and they're almost taking 100 of your, of your um of your equity, basically, if that makes any sense, i have a full video tutorial on buybit
i do explain all of this on the tutorials, because it just takes some time here to try and explain it
i have video tutorials on these platforms, primex bt, i explain margin trading in detail
and also by bit, i do explain how this, uh, old percentage works
i've also got timestamps on it, so if you're just going to want to go directly into that, okay, let me just scroll down and go into the tutorials here
if you put by bit tutorial, bitcoin census, then, yeah, you you mean this, you should have this video right over here
we've got time stamps, okay? we got the difference of, you know, we got limit orders
you got also, um, the leverage also here, somewhere inverse perpetual versus usdt perpetual
i've got a full, you know, 31 minute tutorial on vivit if you want to, you know, all of these questions are answered on, on there
so, what is happening with bitcoin? oh, we having some pretty bullish momentum here
we would have to go sideways here for me to take a short position
uh, like i said, you know, we are getting a reaction from this range
but i am, you know, no one will beat me at waiting to enter a position
if you do get a drop here and then a potential consolidation and another attempt, that will be the moment i will short
this is where i will, i will see that the bully bullish momentum is is lagging, and you're not going to break it
i am waiting for a busy position here, because why short here? and then maybe price action is going to do this where i can, when i can wait to see if you're going to do this, or if you're going to do this and consolidate a little longer and go sideways, then i will short
you know, this is the thing, people are very in a rush to take a trade, take a trade
and this was, we were calling for this range all the way down here, on the 28th, 29th of may
and, you know, it was pretty funny, because this is how you can understand it
the day on the 30th of may, 31st of may, did i short here? i did not
if you look at the video from the 31st of may, i'm saying, guys, i am looking for shorts here
and then on the livestream on the 1st of june, i said, guys, i have jumped on a trade
and that is the best explanation that i could give you right now on what could happen on bitcoin
it is true, we had a big resistance level it's the 618 from this drop
but it's not the time to short just yet, because we're still in a pretty large uptrend momentum
the moment we start going sideways in this uptrend channel, the moment we start breaking the higher low trend line here and have this kind of price action, that's a great moment to jump in a potential trade
you know, i would be looking for that, you know, this this area, the thirty thousand six hundred dollar range
it's very likely going to have that large correction at least to that range
so you're looking for the fifty percent fibonacci retracement also
could you have a leg down to the six one eight? and if you're shorting from this level, take profit area
no doubt in my mind, the thirty thousand six hundred, thirty thousand seven hundred, you know, it won't soon
i will be doing a video update afterwards to see what is happening with bitcoin
are you bullish on bitcoin next couple of weeks? we have 63 percent of people saying yes
there is more people bullish in the comment section in the community
i mean, if you shorted the very top here at 314, 315, yeah, why not? i mean, that's really good
these are the kind of trades you want to get into if you get stopped out
and this is the key here, for waiting on this consolidation, because then the drop will happen really aggressively
as soon as this consolidation happens, you know, the drop will happen fast
and the risk to reward you are looking for that four to one, okay? five to one, even better trade
and also take a look at the bitcoin sensor website if you want to know about the latest news and articles, also technical analysis, ideas, totally free information
and i got three different levels where i could potentially see bitcoin coming to for a potential retest
we do have some big momentum right now, but that is only because we did close with an inverted hammer yesterday, and we are filming this week
the 12 hourly chart, you can see that i have a supply zone where i potentially can see market pull back into and then reverse if we break that level, we have the 12 hourly fibonacci, where we also can see the market reverse from
if we have a bigger pullback, what we're gonna do, we're gonna go to the daily charts, and we're just gonna use the fibonacci from the last lower high with the lower low
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly what i look for around these levels to see the market potentially reverse back down from [Music]
if you were on my live stream yesterday, we were speaking about this inverted hammer that we do have against a support
so we can do something like this, we touch the previous wicks, and when we see the market giving us a inverted hammer
and you can also see on the lower time frames, this is a weekly chart, so this is where you can see the market happen, holding up to 8 627 900 as a support
so when the market gave us this inverted hammer, or, oh yes, inverted hammer we we were talking about this on the live stream, that market would push back up and this is exactly what happens right now on bitcoin, and to where can we potentially see the market come to
so the first thing that i will do is that i will use this previous fake out that we did have from, uh, we broke it from 31 280, and after that, you saw this huge bounce back down
so one thing that i will do is that, on the 12 hourly chart, i will take this candlestick that we did have on first of june, and i'm gonna do, i'm just gonna use it as a supply zone
and this is the first level that i look at bitcoin, first of all, to see if we see the market break to the downside from it, if we break this level, around thirty one thousand nine hundred
so what i'm going to do is that i drag the fibonacci on the 12 hourly chart from this last little lower high that we did have, from 36 040, back down to the low at 28 570
and this is the fibonacci levels that that we will potentially, if we break this supply zone, we can come back up to 32 297 and 30 3188
and from these levels, this will be where i will see on the lower time frames, if we have a break of structure and the market is continuing back down
because on the lower time frames, what we can see for reaching these levels is, in this case, small low, low, high highs and high lows
and break up structure will be when we come, or if we come inside the fibonacci levels, or this could also happen right here on the supply zone, is that when the markets and when the market breaks the last higher low and creates a lower low, as always, this is where we start to look, where i start to look for self positions and just wait for the market to drop
but first of all, we need to have a lot of patience to wait and see if the market actually will give us this
we can go down to the lower time frames, because this is where you will start to see the reversed um, the reverse
and on the higher time frames, you will just connect the dots
what i'm gonna do is that i want to drag a trend line like this
it's not the most beautiful one, and just because we break it, that doesn't mean that this whole that we will see a big reverse
and if we see that the market does have the power to break it
and then you see, then i see the market giving me a reverse to the upside again
we just might also retest this previous little higher higher law at 31 354
and from these levels, we could definitely see the market having a another bounce back down
but we also need to focus on this huge movements that we did have
but this could still be a lower high for because if we look at what happened here, you had such a huge movement
the one thing that we also can have in mind is that the market is now creating higher lows
but that is only because we need the push on the higher time frames
so of course, when we're coming back down to a support and the market is and the market needs to create a big, bigger pullback, the market needs to create higher highs and higher lows
well, the market now break the supply zone create another higher high
because in that case, this will, it will break this previous higher high, because this higher high is higher than this lower high
so technically we broke the trend line, but we could only see the market pushing back up a little bit more for the market to create a lower high
but if we from nowhere, would see that the market is not even respecting these fibonacci level that i just spoke about
and from these levels, we could potentially mark see the market doing the exact same thing that we did expect it to do here
market comes inside the fibonacci levels between 34 180 and 35 443
and from these levels, this is where i will the same thing again
i will start to look at, okay, do we have a break of structure here now? and if we are breaking the last higher low, but now we are on the daily this will happen on the lower time frames, but it's the same concept
so if we see the market creating high highs and higher lows, we just might potentially see the market consolidate inside 50 and 61 percent
and when you see the market, or when i see the market, break the previous higher low again, the market creates a lower low
this time we use another fibonacci from the last high to that lower low
and the fibonacci levels will give us the lower high targets for then see the market to potentially drop
so this is what i am looking for right now when it comes to bitcoin
don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video, or somewhere up here in the corner
as always, this is how you are supporting me in the consensus
but the best thing with biped is obviously the very low fees that we have when we want to hold our swing positions for a longer time
i go through daily updates every single morning, 8 am, swedish time, one hour before london session
it was a really good session that we did have, remember, i have it from monday to friday, so you're more than welcome
this is how we use the setups before everything starts to happen, so we know where the market could potentially come to break certain levels, etc
so if you want to learn how to back test, you can go to my back test with me
but you can see that i did talk about supplying and demand, exactly what we used in today's video, trend lines, etc
so if you want to learn how to back test, or just want to learn a strategy, you can definitely go into these ones and just try to copy and paste what i do, and hopefully you can use it in your own charts
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
it's only because the market needs to correct itself a little bit after the weekend
how are you? we're just gonna try to wait for the rest of the people to come into the live stream
and while we do that, you can please go inside and like the live stream so you can help me grow the channel so we can reach out to more people
i was tired this morning, but i mean, it is what it eats, right? good morning
were you on my, my back testing live stream yesterday? and did you enjoy it? it was a long life, it was a long live stream
and if you haven't already looked at it, if you go to my youtube channel
so what i do every single week now here and there, i have back testing sessions with you
we talked a lot about, we talked a lot about, uh, supply and demand zones, again, combined, no trend lines and fibonacci
so yeah, if you, if you want to practice and you want to have some guidance to practice
how are you? you can also go down, and you have multiple videos now where i do the back testing
it's really good if you want to, if you want to sit and practice yourself and don't know how to do back testing, so that is really good
we don't have anything special on usd until, uh, i think it's friday
and tomorrow we so on tuesday we have one, uh, at 2 30 pm trade
how are you? and then we didn't have, okay, so we did have something on tuesday
we have, uh, at the, is it new york session? um, but the market moves pretty much during that time anyway
but, um, you know, as long as we have it in mind, that's really good
so yesterday we spoke about this, and i spoke about us being bullish
and if we go down to the lower time frames, and we'll drag the fibonacci, which i already did
um, so yeah, we so this is the week that i speak about that we need to fill
but if we also go down to the lower time frames, um, let's see
we also have a trend line that we need to break, obviously, before we reach 2034 or 212 on the daily chart
now, we also have a demand zone, because from this candlestick right here, at 28th of may, you saw this push
so this is a great read test for the push to to the upside, right? um
so we can slowly, instead, go down to the lower time frames and see what we can see
[Music], could we have taking a fibonacci? did we talk about this one yesterday? we must have done that on my, on my stream, because this was at, yeah, we must have talked about this yesterday
i don't have the setups, um, but i do believe that we spoke about this one coming back down for a retest after, okay, whatever
and what we're waiting for the market to do now, uh, we did break the, uh, the resistance trend line
and based on that, i still, it looks like we can have another push
so we're just waiting for a pullback, or i'm waiting for a pullback
if we have a little bigger pullback, bigger, we can come back down on ethereum, to, uh, 1842 or 1835
or if we only see a quick pullback, we are slightly above the 50, but we can potentially come back down to 1864 or 1860 if we break below, if we break below 1858, this could happen, something like that
so, uh, if we see a bigger drop, we can use a previous higher low to see the market either retest it, or we'll just drag a fibonacci, if you go notching
um, if you don't have a fake out, and you see the market just, you know, look something like this
but we could definitely pull back down again to 618 percent at 100, 860 for a last potential touch
because on the higher time frames, the market is creating high highs and high lows
and we can also come back down to, we can also come back, pull back down to potentially 99737
so, uh, if you didn't know, when when the xy go back down, pull back down, bitcoin goes up
so that is, you see the market on dxi now, um, creating a lower, a potential lower high
but if the market is breaking the previous higher high that we have at 102 points and 900, 600
and then we also look at the higher time frames, candlesticks
and you can see that we do have um we also, we did retest a previous low
and then we also have another lower high right here that is kind of combined with the fibonacci level
and this is, uh, also where you see the market try to break it
so we we we tested a higher low, we retest, which we tried to break the previous lower high
we failed to do that, and now we're retesting at the same previous resistance that we tried to break, that tried to fake us out
and every time, i will, i never stopped saying this, but the market, when the market fake you out, it usually comes back and retests the previous resistance that it tried to break
so that is why i do believe that this could be the beginning for dollars to pull back down at least a little bit more
and that is also really good, because when we look at ethereum, if i do expect dollars to go down, that is combined with that, we can see that it looks like we can actually have a pullback on ethereum and bitcoin, now a link, a bigger pullback
that is why we started to see some movements now to the upside
so the market, you can see, we haven't seen a green candle for a long time
so this just might be where this week will be bullish, and you see the market pull back up
we can also come back up and retest, potentially 2510, and then see the drop
and this is also something that we spoke about in yesterday's live stream, is that when when the market on the higher time frames needs to do a pullback, the market will obviously always look like it would break the downtrend in this case
and based on that, a lot of people want the market to reverse back up
when you start to see bull uh, bullish candlesticks and bullish movements, you you you're getting hyped
and but then when the market pulls back up to a level where it only give you retest, and then see the market continues back down
you're trapped in your own head that the market is going up only because you see a regular pullback, right? um, so, yeah
sign how are you? uh, anshu? um, uh, where from where you learn trading? um, i had some people that helped me, but i've been, i've been trading myself every single day since 2018
so yesterday, yesterday, when we were looking at this is great
so this was something that we spoke about on yesterday's live stream
on the weekly chart, remember the inverted hammer? ah, the market does exactly what it's supposed to do
so if you were on my live stream yesterday, you already knew that this move was supposed to happen
so congratulations to everyone that was on my live stream, not only if you chose to take a trade based of it, because you you do whatever you want to do, because i am only i'm not a financial advisor, but also that you learn to see how the market is actually moving, and how important is for us to actually understand what we look at, how we used tools
we've been in a sideways market, so for the market to pull back up from the support, up back up to the resistance pretty it's pretty normal
but after a huge support like this, we can't expect the market to pull back up, um, how far we we spoke about was it on the 12 hourly again
but why did i use that one? why am i confusing myself? or maybe i was using that resistance, okay
but one thing that is really important is that now when we're gonna start to use supply and demand zones, look at the daily, 12 hourly i think i want to use this level right here
alessandra, how are ya? uh, rosh, do you have a sculpting strategy? this works
everything that i do right now also works on the lower time frames
okay, so looking at bitcoin, we have a supply, a supply zone between thirty one thousand five hundred and seventy five and thirty one thousand nine hundred and seventy six
and remember, if you were on my live stream, or you've been looking at my live stream videos where i talk about supply and demand zone, this is a supply zone, because after the candlestick, you saw this huge push back down
and so if the market pull back up to this level, what can, what can happen? and look at now, we also have a previous resistance, right? we have a previous resistance trend line, which also is pretty good, combined with where the last um lower high was, or did, the supply zone
so we can definitely see a quick retest of it, and then potentially see the market, uh, have a breakdown
but if we also go to the higher time frames, oh no, we're still on the 12 hour lease
hello dan, how are you? and we drag it back down to, uh, 28 576
which means that if we break this supply zone with, if the market doesn't respect this level, the fibonacci levels is where i am
me where i will start to look and see if this could be the potential drop back down
we're pushing back down, but then i think the market will find the support and resistance and then just consolidate and then eventually break up
i don't think we're done with the with the downtrend just yet
if we have a bigger pullback, because everything can happen, what we're going to do is that would drag the fibonacci back up from the weekly last lower high, ad for the 6837
and we're gonna also, we're gonna use it at twenty nine thousand three hundred and eighty eight
so technically, on the higher time frames, weekly, lower, high, lower, low
and then if we see the market now from nowhere, have a bit so all of the targets that i was looking at on the lower time frames, if the market like, you know what? we don't care about this, natalie, and you start to see the market having momentum to the upside
and now you a lot of people would be like, ah, market is going up on bitcoin
and then market comes to thirty eight thousand sixty eight and, uh, forty thousand one hundred and seventy
and here you slowly instead to see the market reverse back down
and all of the people that bought the market, they're going to be so surprised when they see the market reverse back down, because they didn't understand that on the weekly or on the high time frames, as i told you in the beginning of this live stream, is that when the market needs to create a pullback on the higher time frames, it obviously is a bigger pullback
but i knew that this was where the lower high could be created
the market can obviously have a huge momentum to the upside um
but always have that in mind, at least always have that in mind
and if the market choose to do something else, then we just follow what the market does, because we are not here to try to fight the market
don't prove yourself right to the market, because the market will smash you in the face and take all of your money
and we don't want that, right? if you didn't wake up, now you woke up
i'm israeli, so i can't stay up late all the time for user translation
so every every morning live stream that i have, like this one, it's always at this time
but then i usually go on a live stream at the around new york session
that is not that that doesn't, i mean, i i totally understand that you don't want to go up in the middle of the night to look at this live stream
but this is also one good thing, is that we don't always have the setups, or i don't always have the setups in the more, uh, when we do it, we usually don't take a trade this time
so what you can do is that you just go back to the live stream when you wake up and just look at it
and then you're just looking at the charts and see, okay, where are we just put the exact same setups that i do have, and then you just look at the charts and you'll see it
because, as i told you, we just do the setups now, if the market then pulls, and the market will later give us the opportunity to either buy or sell the market
hey, now, you know, okay, so, yeah, um, over a but overall on bitcoin, now, as the same thing that on ethereum, let's see if we came back down once, you know, um, just waiting for a pullback, because the market did break this resistance trend line
but remember, the first level that i look at on bitcoin now is, uh, 31 574 and 31 953 for to see if the market then slowly steady, could potentially break down
uh, guys, if you are new to the channel, channel, super welcome
as i just told you, every single day, monday to friday, i have these mornings live streams
this week i will try to give you, give you three videos per day, um, from monday to friday
if you are a beginner, go back down crypto trading for beginners, super good
look at these different videos, and just practice it for yourself and do it on your own charts
if you didn't know, now you know, you can also receive a bonus on bible
it's up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
if you have any questions, please share it and i'll try to answer you
i know that from america, you need vpn um, but this platform is really good when we want to hold our positions for a long time with a very low fee
so this is more a, you can obviously day trade scalp on a tube, but it's definitely good for swing trading, please
uh, if we potentially have a small pullback on b2c, where would it be? um, okay
so on the lower time frames, this is either, okay, so that usually what we do, is that i drag fee from the last low to the to the high
but based on that we did have such a huge push right? maybe we don't even have the power to pull back down to 30 550 or 30 393, because it's pretty far away
and based on that we had this huge pullback, and we just, uh, might have a small pullback, right? so we can also use this low from 30 897 to the high at 31 240, which means that if we don't see the market pushed back up now, we could potentially use 31 070 and 31 026 for a potential quick pullback, and then see the market, uh, push through the upside, right? but everything depends, and the same thing that i, i showed you on ethereum, if we break below thirty thousand and nine hundred, this could be where we see the market slowly and steady
it doesn't have to look like this, but that could take us back down to the high, to the to the higher time frames fibonacci, and then see the reverse back up
but i only believe, i do believe that we will, i do believe that we only will have a quick pullback because we had such a huge candlestick
um, whatever happened, i really want to say that we went through the worst of it
even though they are different from mine, they usually agree in the end
because this is the thing, right? and it's, it's also very important for everyone that, especially if you are not an experienced trader, you have to always remember that just because i tell you what, how i use the chart, this doesn't mean that your method is not working
i've been trying to figure out how the market moves for so long
and this clicks inside my head, doesn't mean it has to click in your head
and obviously we need to repeat it all the time, because the brain always, you need to refresh your memory
and it's, it is a lot of things, uh, to understand when it comes to trading
and they, they move similar, similar, similar, similarly to bitcoin and ethereum, because it's against the usd
and, okay, so the first thing that i did remember the trend lines that we spoke about yesterday
we are going to use a trend line from on the three monthly chart, from this low connected with this higher low
so if we would see the market pushing back down, even more, we can come back down
so this is so far away, but it's always good to have it in your head
if we come back down to this level, you would, you could definitely see a push back up
so, um, on the monthly chart, we broke below the previous support, the previous highly low
and this looks a little bit familiar to what happened to let's see
so what i'm gonna do is that i drag a fibonacci from 26 595 to the high around thousand 36 hundred and five
we have already retested fifty percent at thirty one thousand and five hundred
so another thing, because you can see that the market is right now pushing down, right? as long as we are above 33 and 900, or 33 000, or 34k, we could definitely see push but if we break above it and see retas, that could be the market giving us a inverted head and shoulders
and we are at levels right now where we will see if this happens or not
so i dragged the fibonacci now for the lower high, potentially from 34837, back down to the previous lower low at thirty one thousand two hundred and eighty two
now you can see that when the market is in, uh, the market is consolidating
we did retest the sixty one point eight percent a couple of days ago, but we the market is in a sideways market
and that usually happens when the market comes to a higher time frame
always good to remember, on the lower time frames, fibonacci, you usually only see a quick retest on the 15 61 percent
on the higher time frames, fibonacci, because the distance is bigger
um, so what we're going to do is that we drag a support trendline, connect the dots, and we try to take it from this week, and we combine it with the higher low
um, can you see how this candlestick just came back down and retested this trend line so perfectly, we almost broke it? you can see that more clear on the lower time frames
so that is why it's really good to connect on the four hour line
now you'll see that the market is giving us the the um, the bodies that i told you that we're never allowed to cut
that combined, uh? or looking at the 12 hour lean, those two candlesticks is a wick on the 12 hourly chart
so this can obviously also be a great so you can see i changed the trend, the trend line, because i don't actually like when the trend line looks like this
i don't like to put a trend line when the market is slowly instead of breaking down
because the last higher low was at this level where we're inside right now
so this was the candlestick after this candlestick, you saw this huge push back up, right? so we tried to connect the higher lows, and the last higher low was this one, technically
it's just a little bit, but we can adjust it a little bit more
can you see how i don't even cut any candles, even if i see the break of it? and we also have a supply zone this level
and this we've already retested this level one time market came back up for a quick retest
so what we're going to do now is that we drag, if it, from the high to the low
so i drag it from the 50 percent, that will also have the fibonacci from 33 33 480, around that level, back down to thirty two thousand nine seven hundred
and so that gives us fibonacci levels between 33 136 and 33 220
so what i'm gonna do is that i will put a alert here in case the market pushed back up to these levels, because this is where i can expect the market to drop back down from
take profit 1 is 32 648, take profit 3 is 32 287, and say, profit three will be thirty one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight
so let's say, for example, that would take it from the fifty percent
take profit one is four thousand nine hundred and seventy four times your money
and take profit two is eight thousand five hundred and fifty pips
take profit three is eleven thousand five hundred and eighty pips
so, um, when it comes to us 30, when it comes to use 30, uh, always be very even
i'm no financial advisor, this is what this is for myself, but if you choose to trade, you is 30, always remember that use 30
because use 30 is also very volatile, and it needs the space, definitely the space to move
and we but the thing is that we also retest the the 60, now the 50
so if we go down to the lower time frames and see what's happening, i will also use this fibonacci from this high that i have, from 33 280 to 32 902
i know it's very messy on the charts, but this is, i mean, i i know what i look for, and i always look to see what level which, which one of the levels does the market start to reverse back down from? so either we use the one hourly fibonacci, or we use the four hourly fibonacci, from this last high to this low
but market has already retested that fibonacci, so it kind of makes sense if we now create another lower high below the previous lower high, and then see the drop
and you can slowly start to see how the market is very, very, very slow
you don't know what pips is, guys? what all of the numbers that you see here, when i say, oh, the market is at 33 055 between
so let's say if the market pull, okay, so you can use this one
so from from this line, 33 550 and when, and you see how the numbers is changing right here
so when the market moves from one, uh, price to another, that is called, these are called pips, 15 percent pips, and presented
so let's say if the entry is from this fibonacci at 33 000 88 back down to the first target at 32 810 200, 2781 pips, it's because that is how much, from the entry back down to the first take profit
so it's pretty hard to explain things like that, i'm gonna be honest, because that is like the basic thing
and i usually don't talk about exactly how pips works, uh, shift click option
how many new people do we have? i know we have so many people that usually is on my live streams, which is really amazing
but tell me, guys in the chat, where are you from? i'm from sweden
and sebsep is also living, not sepsis is also from uk, but he's also in spain
so if you look at this, everyone said, we wish you had a great day today on your first job, new job, new job
i actually had a lot of people from estonia before also, and i didn't know them, but they was also doing trading through another company before
stacy is from los angeles, spain, argentina, alabama, philippines, california, um swaziland
is that? is that? no, that is do i know anything? i only know it should be dish when it comes to my my, i have a a little sister
and when we're, when we were kids, um, she, she spoke, she learned germany in school, and then she started to talk to me in german
and i was like, what? she was like, you don't understand that? i was like, no
so, my little sister, she's very, she's very good when it comes to languages
and she came to me, and when she was mad, she was, she started to say things in korean to me, very ugly words
so we can see, come pull back up to 632, potentially, or 65, because that is the higher time frames fibonacci
if we drag, i drag the fibonacci from the high, uh, 705 back down to 56
so that gives us these fibonacci levels where we can expect the market to pull back down from
uh, where eight to six p eight to six people have lived it is 133 on it
it would be great, 100 likes not to get a new microphone from samsung
so if we want to piss off september, he needs to buy my, buy me a new microphone, even though my microphone is completely new, but it still doesn't work
uh? so, yeah, i'm just waiting for the market to push up to these levels
but we can also, now we're looking at comp we drag another fib from 666 back down to 511, we could also see the market reverse from 60 point to nine or 622, fibonacci levels for then see the market continue back down
so these are the levels, because if we see the market break the support, you can have a quick retest, and then market comes inside of the support
yeah, i don't know, when it comes to technology, in me, it sometimes it doesn't work so good
and i remember when i was a kid, if i got angry, like, lamps started to like, so, i don't know, maybe it's i have too powerful energy and technology, technology cannot handle that
uh, let's see what else we can go through before i go, because i need to go within 10 minutes
so if there's anyone that wants me to look at any coins, please write it
if you are new to the channel, don't forget to subscribe to it so you know when i am live tomorrow
because i do have these live, morning live streams every single day, monday to friday
if you want to have help with back testing, you go into my previous back testing live streams
um, if you are a beginner, these can be this is very advanced, so maybe if you don't understand it's because of that
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
do you have any good, um, any good information about that? does obs shock? okay, dot, so it just feels like we're gonna have a bigger pullback
i don't know why, but on the daily chart, the last lower high, the highest point is 1050
so if we now break so okay, so i use the higher time frames also to co to calculate a height, a higher fibonacci from the weekly chart
but these levels are so far away, so there's nothing that we focus on
but we can come back up to twelve point fifty dollars, or thirteen point forty dollars, too
but before we reach these levels, we need to break this resistance trend line that we are below
and i also highlighted the previous lower high on the daily charts, which means that you can see the market push back up
we can, we can break the trend line, but only come back up and retest eight, 1035, 1048 or 50
and from these levels, you will either see the market come back down inside the trend, again the trendline
if that is the case, we you would change the trend line against that lower high, okay? but if we start to see that the market, so break of structure on the daily will be if we break the previous lower high create a higher high
and then, with the help of fibonacci, we will, uh, calculate where, or i will calculate where the next higher low can be
and that could be the beginning of a bigger pullback that we need
and that, if that is the case, that's when we're looking at these higher time frames fibonacci for a potential reverse back down
um, so it's just, it's just really good to to use previous targets and see, first of all, okay, how does the market react to them? because there's so many different layers that we need to break through until we come to the higher time frames fibonacci
um, this was the break of structure take fee from high, from low to high
this is perfectly the market used this fibonacci between 932 and 935 as a perfect support for dancing the push
yeah, you saw on bitcoin and ethereum, we only had a quick retest, so the market didn't have the problem
but this was what we were looking at when it came to bitcoin and ethereum
so what could we have done to to see that move? nothing much really, more than using this previous support
either we come back up and retest the trend line, or we break above retested lower high
we're looking for a higher low to buy the market for it to push back up, potentially to higher time frames
but we also have another high that we need to break, and it's this level, uh, between 1136 and 1185
so can you see how many targets the market will need to break before it reaches these levels? it can definitely happen
but as i told you, it's always too good to have in mind the other prices the market will retest
arson, natalie, please give a chance to, oh, did we have a spammer? i didn't even realize
okay, we're gonna go to axx only because it looks like it was, but we did look at it yesterday
so yeah, yesterday we also looked at 2575 and 2757 when it comes to axs
but the first level that we can come back up and reach is 2326 and 2380, because that is also previous, uh resistance
so i do believe that we will have a bigger pullback to these levels
i would want the market to break above 3050, create a high low, and then that could be the a bigger pullback, or a beginning for a potential reverse backup
we can either have a pullback up to one point nine thousand six hundred and fifty four, potentially one point thirteen thousand two 232 for the market to reverse back down
if we break the trend line, we can pull back up to point thirty five thousand four hundred and forty, potentially one point
forty, six thousand three hundred and twenty four, then a potential reverse
so these are the first levels i look for the market to create a lower high against
and if we see the market having more momentum, it will not happen today, but if that is the case, we just drag the fibonacci back up, and you you that will give us other fibonacci levels
i don't like to trade so much, uh, during mondays if i don't have a really good setup
natalie, it's time to look at the charts for some sell opportunities, potentially
what is i want you to ask yourself every single day, what is the best thing can what is the best thing that can happen to your life? because usually we always ask, well, what is the oh, what is the worst thing that can happen? don't have that mindset

my name is josh, and bitcoin has just put an end to this massive losing streak of nine consecutive red weekly candles
but with that being said, the bitcoin price still has some strong resistance in these bitcoin order books, which i'll be talking more about in just a moment
and of course, later in this video, i'll be including ethereum as usual
and as you probably already know by now, we've had nine red weeks in a row, at least up until the most recent weekly kennel close, which was within the last one day
and obviously you can see here that last week's candle turned out to be a green weekly candle at the candle close, which means bitcoin has finally put an end to this massive losing streak, which is actually a brand's new record for bitcoin, because this is the first time in bitcoin's entire price history that we've seen nine red weeks in a row
so statistically speaking, it's very unlikely we're going to see another nine red weeks in a row, considering the fact that this has only happened one time in about 13 years
but with that being said, i want to make it clear that even though this consecutive losing streak is now over due to this most recent weekly candle close, this does not mean we're only gonna see bullish price action now
because, of course, it is totally possible we could still see a few more red weekly candles
but anyway, if you're looking at the daily bitcoin chart, at the bollinger bands indicator right now, we're still in this squeeze formation, which shows us that there's still another very volatile move coming sometime soon in the bitcoin price
and we haven't experienced the full extent of that volatile move just yet, considering the fact that the bollinger bands are still in this squeeze formation
and if you're completely new to this channel and you have no idea what this means, definitely check out a few of my most recent videos here on the channel
and as for the subscribers out there, of course, i'll continue to keep you updated on this chart in these videos and also in real time over on my twitter as well
and just giving you a really quick update on the two day bitcoin charts
obviously, we still have this active bullish divergence in play, as i've been talking about, basically every single day over the past three weeks or so
and obviously, over the past three weeks we have experienced a lot of reduced bearish momentum, which is exactly what this bullish divergence means for the bitcoin price
and now heading back to the one day bitcoin chart to give you a quick update on this bitcoin fractal i've been talking about over the past one and a half weeks or so
as you can see with today's bitcoin price action, the bitcoin price is clearly deviated from this fractal, which basically means this fractal is beginning to invalidate after it's already shown us two profitable moves
obviously, this pump to the upside that we saw a little over a week ago and then that pullback, were two separate moves in the bitcoin price that we could have traded and made a lot of profits from
so now that this is happening, does this mean that the bitcoin price will not retest these previous lows at around 25 26 000? and well, to answer that, we need to look at more than just this fractal
because, as i always say, i do not use fractals as an exact price prediction, instead as more of a guideline for what could be a likely scenario based on previous price action
and just as a rough guideline for the bitcoin price, this fraxel suggests mostly sideways price action for the bitcoin price that could potentially last for the most part of june
and as for a potential retest of that 25k low, or possibly even lower, down towards something like 23k, of course, that is still possible
because looking at the weekly bitcoin charts, there's technically some more room to the downside in the weekly bitcoin rsi, because we haven't entered into oversold territories just yet, like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market and also at the end of the 2014 bear market
so if this were to play out like any of the other major bear markets we've seen throughout bitcoin's history, then once again, technically speaking, we do have a little bit more room to the downside
so even though we do have some room to the downside, it doesn't mean we have to go down there like what we saw in march 2020
we did not see the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories
in fact, we got as low as pretty much where we're sitting at right now
and if you're completely new to the channel, you might be wondering, what does all of this information mean? it's basically my personal bitcoin investing strategy that i've been talking about almost every day over the past one month, is that, by default, i've been dollar cost averaging into bitcoin
and if the bitcoin price enters into this price range in between the 1 000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average, which are currently coming in at around 28 and a half thousand and around 223 k, respectively
and if the bitcoin price enters into that price range, personally, i go heavier into bitcoin, on top of my regular dollar cost averaging
and obviously, we have already seen one week to the downside into this price range below 28 000, which was that original dip down towards around 25 000
and of course, if you're on the channel back then around a month ago, you would have been ready for that drop down towards 25k before it actually happened, as i talked about in my videos before the job
but i want to make it clear that this is not financial advice for you
this is simply telling you what i am doing with my own money, based on all of this analysis and according to bitcoin's entire price history
and obviously, what you do with your own money is completely up to you
and now giving you a quick update on the shorter term price action for bitcoin here on the four hour bitcoin chart
and obviously, over the past one day, we've seen the bitcoin price break above this line of resistance, which was coming into play at around 30 700
but keep in mind, we saw a similar thing happen around a week ago, where we broke up off this line of resistance, and then we came back down for a retest and immediately failed that retest
so basically what we need to see, if we do come back down for a retest, down towards around 30 700, is simply hold that as support
and if that happens, if we flip that level into new support, then that is extremely bullish, because that would further confirm a breakout to the upside
but what if we don't see a retest at all, and we just continue heading up? well in that scenario, i'll be looking towards this previous high up here, coming into play at around 32 and a half thousand, as our next important resistance level to break a buff because otherwise if we turn around before that level, then we'll essentially create a lower high
and technically speaking, a lower height would be bearish market structure
which is why we need to see a strong breakout above around 32 and a half thousand in order to further confirm more bullish price action and possibly a further trend reversal in the somewhat shorter term
or if we don't immediately break that high, and we come back down for a retest once again, we need to hold above 30 700 as new support
otherwise this breakouts has essentially failed into another fakeout, if we break back below 30 700
and in that scenario, i would expect the bitcoin price to continue to drop down towards around 29 and a half thousand as our next important level of support, if we break back below 30 700 once again
and something else to point out here is the fact that the four hour bitcoin rsi is getting close to overbought territories
in fact, we briefly entered into overbought territories within the last few hours or so
so just keep that in mind, because if the rsi enters into overbought territories, that means we have somewhat limited room to the upside, at least in the shorter term
and if you're looking at the bitcoin order books across all of these exchanges right now, we're seeing a lot of sell orders pop up at around 32 and a half thousand, which further confirms that shortterm bitcoin analysis
because for any of the beginners out there, when we see a big chunk of sell orders in the order books, that is literally what resistance is
because in order for the bitcoin price to go any higher than 32 and a half thousand, basically we need to see a lot of buyers come in and buy up all of those sell orders placed at that price level
and just before heading into the ethereum part of this video, taking a quick look at the us
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and as you can see here, nothing much has happened recently in the stock markets
basically over the past few trading days, we've seen a lot of choppy, sideways price action, relatively speaking
but at least this is better than the stock market immediately dumping into new lower lows, because in that scenario, we'll likely see a lot more bearish price action for bitcoin
but if we continue to see a lot of choppy, sideways price action in the stock market, and especially if we see more bullish price action in the stock market, that would take a lot of the pressure off bitcoin, because the price of bitcoin is heavily correlated to what the stock market is doing, at least most of the time
and obviously, we still have these active bullish divergence playing out
and if you're new to the channel and you want more information about what this means for ethereum, check out my last video here on the channel, because in that video i went into a little bit more detail about this bullish divergence for ethereum
and now taking a look at the shorter term ethereum price action here on the six hour time frame
and as you can see here, the price of ethereum, especially over the past one day, has further confirmed this higher low, which means, technically speaking, we're no longer forming that potential descending triangle pattern that i've been talking about over the past few days
and instead, now that we technically have a higher low structure forming for ethereum
this is more of a symmetrical triangle pattern, or a horizontal triangle pattern, which technically speaking, is not as bearish as a descending triangle pattern, because this type of pattern by itself is more of a neutral pattern
but oftentimes you can take into consideration the trends that entered into the pattern to slightly sway the bias of this pattern
which means if we entered into this pattern in a downtrend, then, technically speaking, this pattern could be slightly biased towards a bearish outcome
but really we just need to wait for either a break below support or above resistance
and right now, this support line is coming into play at around 1740, and this line of resistance is coming into play at around 1920 to 1930
and if we see a confirmed breakout above resistance, then that places a technical price target at around 24k
but if we see a confirmed break below support, then that places a technical price target at around 14k
but obviously, as of right now, we have not seen a confirmed breakout of resistance or support at the moment
and what is really interesting is just taking a look at the ethereum short positions on the bitfidex exchange here, on the daily time frame, we are still seeing a lot of these ethereum shorts close
pretty much every single day over the past few days, we've seen upwards of five million dollars worth of ethereum short positions close
and on some days, we've seen tens of millions of dollars of ethereum shop positions close
and over the past three to four weeks, we've seen well over 300 million dollars worth of ethereum short positions on the bitfenix exchange close
and if you want to know exactly what this means for the price of ethereum, when i compare the shorts to the ethereum price action right here, then once again, check out my last video on the channel, because in that video i went into much more detail about all of this
and just giving you a really quick update for ethereum vs bitcoin
and basically, with today's price action, we have the potential of invalidating this bullish divergence already, because the daily rsi is potentially about to break this upper turning line of support
and so basically, in order to maintain these bullish diversions as an active bullish divergence, we need to see a higher low structure continue to form in the daily rsi at the next daily kennel close, which is in around three hours from now, at the time of recording this video
and one of the main reasons as to why this bullish divergence is potentially failing right now is because of the bitcoin dominance absolutely skyrocketing through this bearish divergence, which is now basically invalidated
but technically speaking, it will be invalidated at the next daily close, if we close anywhere where we're sitting at at the moment, which is sitting at around 47 and a half percent
but obviously, if you've been an active viewer here on this channel, even when we're forming these bearish diversions for the bitcoin dominance this entire time, i've still remained bearish for alt coins compared to bitcoin
because in this time in the markets, the alt coins are seriously risky and have a lot of downside risk, which is why, a while ago, i moved some of my ethereum holdings into bitcoin to be a little bit lighter on ethereum and heavier into bitcoin
and i'm certainly extremely light on the rest of the alt queen market
i do have a couple other small alt coins, but very, very light holdings
because once again, during this time in the markets when the bitcoin dominance is skyrocketing in a strong uptrend, the old coin market, on average, gets basically crushed compared to bitcoin
but this shouldn't be anything new for the subscribers out there, because basically every day over the past one month, i've been repeating the same information about alt queens versus bitcoin
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen, if you want to maximize your profits in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
hey, what's going on guys? it's matt, and i'm back with another bitcoin update
so this is where we're going to break down the market structure and discuss what the price action is likely to do over the next upcoming days
as always, drop a like and subscribe if you enjoy this content
any of the links in the description if you want to join my public trading community or my public trading community for additional trading guidance
let's recall that that this is the most recent liquidity grant that we had on may 31st
so this is where the price action was range bound for a couple of days, actually, a couple of weeks
and we did briefly spike above this recent high that we had on may 15th, and then we continued dropping lower
and at this point we're now hovering at around the midpoint of this range
so the the midpoint, on a lower time frame, we can see, is basically acting as a pivot point where, although the overall volume has slowed down, so we're not as volatile, we've been sort of fluctuating here for a couple of days now
now one thing that's pretty important is that we initially did have a price and balance here to the left inside of this bullish rally
and if we remind ourselves this liquidity graph that occurred towards the end of may, this liquidity grant would have sweeped all the liquidity that was residing above the highs during the beginning of may
meaning that if the price action were to rally again, which we currently are rejecting the midpoints of this daily range, if we were to rally and push back up above this range into the prices that we were trading in while we had this liquidity graph, well then the next region that would be targeted for liquidity, at least from the perspective of buyers, would be higher highs above the high that we had on may 31st, right? because we already filled this price and balance here to the left
we liquidated these highs during the beginning or middle of may
so it would make sense at that point that we continue rallying
but this is only one probable scenario, so it's important that we stay patient and react to what the price action is doing
and as far as right now, the price action is pretty much range bound
so although this is one scenario, and it would be a great scenario, where the price action, having formed a low followed by a lower low and a higher low, will suddenly just take off and push for the remainder of june
we also have to be open for the possibility that this doesn't happen
if we now take a look at the weekly chart, this is what the weekly candle currently looks like
so this weekly candle is about to close in a couple of hours, as of the recording of this video
and so although it does have this large upper wick showing a sign of a rejection, the last week's candle also did did that as well
so for the most part, the past three weeks have been quite mundane, where we haven't really been making as much progress as we have had over the past couple of weeks
and that's obvious because we've had this strong bearish trend
and so before this bearish trend will resume, liquidity needs to be gathered up at that point, right? so one scenario that i'm also paying attention to is that, let's say this weekly candle closes the way that it does, i can see the price action pushing a bit lower near the bottom of this range, respecting it, before continuing to push up again
and at that point, that could be the reaction that's needed, the bullish confirmation of where the momentum picks up
and then we take off and push above 32 000, and ideally push into 33 000 and above
so what that means is that a second alternative here is, although the price action is starting to rebound again from roughly the midpoint of this daily range, what could happen is we can continue consolidating inside of this tiny price action that stretches between twenty nine point six thousand up to thirty point six thousand
we could simply have a short term rally to the upper portion of this range, and then the price action drops down again
so this is where this projection would occur, where we would push down again
and at that point, you need to seek the next region where liquidity is likely relying, which would be below these lows that we formed on june 1st and on june 3rd
so this is the the most recent level where a ton of traders probably got in
this could play out where we continue shooting up into the sky after rejecting the midpoint
an alternative, as i discussed, is let's say you're in a long position, and the momentum dies down, well, this is where you would look to break even if no progress is made, where we don't push above the high of june 2nd
and at that point, the price action turns around and breaks these lows, right? so at that point, these lows would be targeted for liquidity
and if anything, the price action would push much lower, right? so the bottom of this range acts as a major pivot point where we have rejected this region multiple times before
so this would basically represent the next level of daily support
so if we think about that, if the price action simply breaks out of this range into the downside, this is the next level that would be targeted
which means that this week would be quite a bearish week for bitcoin
but again, we do need to break out of this small for our range
okay? but at that point, if this extends into next week, where we push down to the bottom of this range and then bottom out, right? so we reject the bottom portion, and then, let's say the momentum and the bullish volume picks up again, then this is where the price action can rally and we can continue pushing higher
and as far as right now goes, i'm still paying attention for the price action to push above 32 000
and at this point, i'm still eyeing for the price action to push into the supply zone that we have all the way back from may 8th
so right around that supply zone, we also do have a price imbalance slightly above so this is where 345 35 000 would be a long term target of mine, once we do break out of this range
and if we extend this range, this is basically about a measured move
so it's not quite a measured move, but it does go to show that, because the price action has been consolidating quite heavily, the longer you consolidate, once you finally do get a breakout, these breakouts will be incredibly volatile and very impulsive
but that's, of course, if we do respect this range and don't break below it, and the bullish momentum picks up again

i also provide additional guides, additional market update videos and much more trading guidance or mentorship is available
today, we're gonna analyze the situation with bitcoin to see what could happen in the next coming days, of course, next coming hours
pay close attention, because right over here we've got the bitcoin chart on the one hourly
okay, we need to take a look at the bullish and the bearish case scenario
especially if you trading in the short term, if you're doing scalping day trading, you need to take a look at both scenarios always
you can't be extremely bullish, like many people are, or only extremely bearish
i mean, i wish i would have done this live, because i was getting there live ready
i was doing my analysis to talk about some things on this live stream, and i wanted, i took the trade, and i thought, damn it
okay, uh, just so you could see the the insane trade that this was, this was long time since i, i hardly do any scalping at all, and i especially do not trade on sundays
if i do have a swing trade, of course, then only, of course, it's open during the weekend, but no trading usually on sunday
but i was doing some analysis, i did like this position that i will explain in just a few minutes
because first of all, i want to talk about these two scenarios, okay, where we do have a massive, big resistance range
we've been talking about this major, major zone for a long time now, the last, you know, few days, over over a week
it would have been nice to see several attempts, a little bit of consolidation
but we were talking on the live stream on the 3rd of june, that the most probable scenario from this zone would be likely having, you know, this correction coming back down
and i do think that we are probably going to go to lower levels, but we are having a large consolidation right now at this range
and then i know it's the weekend, because usually in the weekend the only kind of price action that you do have is sideways
there's no kind of selling or buying pressure usually in the weekend
and the more we consolidate here, the more, you know, the less bearish i am
because i want to see fast moves to the downside when you're breaking some zones
i do not want to see this kind of consolidation and also a kind of double bottom, adam and eve
all right, this is the pattern that i potentially see, the bullish pattern that could happen for bitcoin in the next coming hours, which is an adam and eve double bottom
what is an adam and eve double bottom? well, first of all, you do have a very aggressive drop
let me just get here, zoom in on the chart to explain you the adam and eve
it is usually a pretty sharp drop, okay? and then you come straight back up, as you can see here on this picture, where you do have the drop, all right, on bitcoin, as you can see, coming from, you know, from an uptrend, you have this big, aggressive drop
in this case, it is the thirty thousand, 30 600, that major zone that we've been talking about for a long time
so you do see this spike over here, right? this would be the atom, right? you have the atom, which is a big spike and a big bounce, hitting a resistant zone, which is our which is the most important resistance for us right now
so we have the second drop, making that double bottom, retesting the 29 300
okay? this is why i am slightly you know, yesterday we were talking about, you know, the bitcoin price very likely to have continuation to the downside
but, you know, when you have these large consolidations, then, yeah, it's, you know, i'm thinking, all right, the bears are not pushing the price down
it is very hard to trade during the weekend because you don't, you don't have that volatility, you don't have that pressure to the upside or to the downside
and i want to know, what do you think? do you think this could be an adam and eve double bottom? like i'm showing you? right over here we have the big spike drop from the 30, 500, 600 range, getting rejected, rejected, and now this nice, round, solid consolidation
all right, we need to say that there is a possibility that the actual bitcoin price can create this double bottom, and in the next coming hours, you know, one or two days, maximum, uh, in between today and tomorrow
and coming all the way up to retest the thirty thousand six hundred dollars
after this double bottom and this very large consolidation, it is possible
um, because of the fractal that we were talking about from december of 2021
we've been talking about this fractal now for the last four or five days, predicting very, very nicely the this entire movement to the upside and to the downside
so, um, yeah, this is why i'm thinking, i'm slightly bearish in this consolidation
but we need to, we need to, you know, look at this scenario also, the double bottom scenario
what else? what other pattern can i see? well, as you can as you, as you saw on the thumbnail
okay, we have a potential descending triangle we're already creating here
if we start coming back down from this range, this is very likely going to be a descending triangle
got rejected from this level, and i'm going to explain right away, and then i'll go through the comment section
i made a scout position just when i was getting the video ready, just when i was getting the thumbnails
and, um, did a quick scalp here, from the thirty thousand one hundred and fifty dollars all the way down here to the twenty nine thousand seven hundred dollar range
and i'm gonna explain why i took this trade and why i took profits here
um, descending triangle is our next, you know, potential scenario also
so we've got a potential double bottom, and we've got a descending triangle
it would be nice to see a consolidation and then price action to the downside, then you could confirm that this is going to be a descending triangle
we've only had one touch just about an hour ago here at this level, so we could still continue to the upside to complete this adam and eve double bottom
if you do break this strong, the strongest resistance level that we do have on bitcoin, which is that thirty thousand six hundred dollars, double bottom scenario
if you solidly break this with a huge amount of volume, then this is going to be very, very tradable
it is very likely that the price of bitcoin will be claiming this high as soon as we get above the thirty thousand five hundred dollars
so there will be some good trading opportunities if what that would were to be the situation, of course, um, i am, i am still bearish
okay, i did have the swing trade here, from this level, shorting
from this range, i took most of my profits, i added to my position
and i've also got the long here, also, from this from this range, from this long, i do hold a little bit of a small position here
um, and what i want to explain is that, you know, i'm gonna still be in this short position
of course, if we do come up here and claim this level, i'll be getting stopped out
i'll be riding this long because there is a possibility that we actually break this zone
and if this adam and eve does play out, it is likely we'll be claiming these highs at the 32 000 levels
and it does make sense that you could have that projected move, because you have a bunch of liquidity above this high already
a lot of people thinking that this is a major peak and we're gonna go to much lower levels
especially if we do break the thirty thousand six hundred dollars, this will be the moment that i'll be saying, guys, you know, get ready, because it's very, very likely we're going to have this leg up to get that liquidity above the 32 000
i'll be sharing my, my potential trades, you know, the potential bounces that we've got on strong levels
so, yeah, just if you're new to the channel, make sure to subscribe, of course, because we're going to do daily update on, you know, potential scenarios on bitcoin to try and take advantage of the situation and scratch a little bit of money
i just took a really nice trade just about half an hour ago before the live stream, and i wish i would have taken it on the live stream
this is the most important why did you take your trade? where was your target? where's your stop loss? okay, so let's zoom in here one second on the one hourly chart
and you know, when you're doing scalping, i've been talking about this, um, this tool, this indicator, right, which is the vpvr
but it's basically showing you the the point of control from each day
and as you can see, right over here, i've been talking about this um, this indicator a few times, actually, the last few weeks
yesterday, i'm sorry, yesterday we were talking about this major, this major drop over here on bitcoin
we had a big rejection and the possible scenario of bitcoin creating a lower high ride over here after this pretty aggressive drop
let me just get the vp vr out of the way one second, right now
and, um, and just show you what we were talking about yesterday, right where we were seeing, you know, that this potential drop and the btc price potentially coming to the 618 zone, guys
and this is the area that we have actually touched to perfection, as you can see, the 618, the 6'5, okay, at these levels to perfection, as you can see here on the chart
i i'm don't usually scalp, but, you know, i felt like scalping, because i was pretty confident from this 618, this potential lower high
618 fibonacci, you know, just touched and came straight back down
and also, let me just show you right over here, um, the the the strongest point of control, uh, from the, uh, from the first of june, as you can see here, we had a biggest point of control here from the first of june, which is exactly here
at the thirty one thousand, uh, thirty thousand one hundred and fifty dollars
that was enough confluence here for me just to take to jump in a quick trade and jump out, guys
and i never usually trade on sundays, but i know, i felt pretty confident in that straight this is something that i wanted to talk about
but of course, when i was doing the analysis, we already had that leg up, and we already came back down
i'm going to explain also the take profit, guys, because this is super important
you could, this happens almost every single day, and you guys can take opportunity with, you know, with these major levels, all right, if you do a good analysis
so, um, yeah, like i said, biggest point of control here from the 1st of june, right here at this level, at the 30 150, where we just touched half an hour ago and got that big, major rejection
now, also, um, you know, if we take a look at volume, of course, you know, if you want to take a look at the volume spikes, look at this large volume that we do have on the first of june, which is exactly at this zone, right? it is in between here and and this candle over here
so this entire zone, this is why, basically, you do have the strongest point of control, because basically that is where all the volume is around this range, in between twenty nine thousand, uh, eight hundred and thirty thousand five hundred
and it seems like that the biggest consolidation is right here, point of control, thirty thousand one hundred and fifty
now, if i go to the 15 minute chart, of course, you know the deal
if i do take these, uh, trades, i do explain, you know, uh, take profit areas, especially for scalping
what was my take profit? where did i just take profit here, just before, um, starting the stream right over here at the, hang on a second
let me just get the vpr out of the way from this level over here
so we have this large, this consolidation, these bounces, this channel, right? this kind of channel that we do have here 618 from the low to the high of this pump, looking for that rejection
can this continue to the downside? because this is ascending channel
and of course, the 618 from this exact low to the spike was right over here at the 29 700 region
because we hit the six one eight from this drop to perfection
and also, we hit the biggest point of control from the first of june, like i showed you here on the one hourly
zooming out a little bit, you know, yeah, that is, that is a major level
and a take profit area is basically looking for that six one eight
you're looking for the six one eight from the start of the pump
and if i zoom out on the 15 minute, of course, this lot, you know, this kind of leg up starts from this range
and you are looking for that 618 to take profit, right? so, yeah, beautiful trade
i do use for day trade on on crypto, i do not swing trade on primax bt, because the fees are a little bit expensive, in my personal opinion
but for other trade, you know, to trade other markets, it is absolutely beautiful to swing trade
if you are interested in trading on primix bt, you can use the link down below, because you will be getting seven percent added to your deposit if you use bitcoin census 50 as a promotion code, of course
you basically get seven percent added to your deposit by using bitcoin census 50 as a promotion good
i've got a full video tutorial also, if you want to learn properly how to use it, you can use bitcoin as collateral ethereum, usdt or usdc
you know, this one might get stopped out at break even because, you know, it's very, very possible
like i showed you zooming out on the one hourly, we got a potential adam and eve scenario right over here
uh? so we could be hitting that thirty thousand six hundred dollars
it's just, uh, we have a double bottom, very large consolidation
of course, you could do scalping on the way, like the the position that i just showed you, you can do the sum of scalping
if you're looking for a small swing trade, right? if you're looking for a trade for two, three, four days, this is no trade zone for me
but if we break this 30 600 range, uh, yeah, this is going to be looking pretty good
and if you break certain big, certain big resistance levels, it's just very, very likely to happen
okay? with large volume at the 30 600 range and and then coming back down, it's very likely going to hold this big, major level
if you have that next attempt, it is very, very likely to continue to the upside
so this is something that we're gonna eye for potential opportunity in the next coming hours, maybe next couple of days
it will be nice on monday tuesday, if the traditional stock market is going to be bullish, then, yeah, this is something that we're going to eye, something that we're going to ask because it's very, very likely we are going to this double bottom
projected move is to come and claim these highs, you're very likely going to get a couple of wicks potentially, or even break the zone
if we do break the 30 500, 30 600 range with large volume, this is the next trading opportunity that i'll be looking for for for this week
remember, remember, i only, i only do about 10 trades maybe a month, guys
it might be 10, it might be five, it might be 15, but i don't make, you know, five trades a day
and you only need two trades to in the month to make huge gains
the bearish one would be actually, you know, creating a kind of descending triangle, if we do consolidate here and for the next couple of days
you know, tomorrow, the 6th of june, 7th of june, if we are gonna create a lower high here, continue back down and consolidate in this zone, it's going to be very likely a descending triangle
and the probabilities in breaking down, you know, obviously higher
you are retesting this base at the 29 300, which was the biggest, strongest point of control, just a few days ago
of course, now it isn't, because now we have been trading here for quite some time at this zone, as you can see
and the point of control, and it was down here just a few days ago
now, the point of control from the volume traded the last 25 days, approximately, it's right over here, because of this consolidation
the reason why we did get this bounce from this range, because we are the biggest point of control from the volume traded the last 25 days
and guess what? you were hitting that 618 level here, from these lows, of course, to the highs, you know, getting that, you know, reaction from this 618 level, as you can see, and getting that bounce
make sure to smash up that like button, because, uh, uh, yeah
basically, i'm just giving you the explanation here on on what i see on bitcoin to get ready for the next coming days, you know, for monday tomorrow
get ready, because it is time to make some money, paper money
we are going to make some money come on, guys, make sure to smash up the like button, because i'm going to do live streams every single day, if i can
all right, this week, every single every single day in the morning here, central european time, to find those opportunities, of course, on bitcoin
let's see if i do manage to do some trades here on the live stream, uh, when we see these opportunities
so, bearish case scenario, we got this level over here, 29 300 range
i've been over 20 minutes, okay, or something like that without going through the comment section
sorry, sorry, guys, because i really want to connect with the community
we consolidate in this range the next couple of days, and break this zone over here, the 29 300, which is a major level already, as you can see here, creating this double bottom
if this, if that were me to be the scenario, of course, we break this low over here, and we would be retesting the 28 600 range
28 dollar range would be the level to retest and potentially get that consolidation
i do see the price wicking down below here to, uh, potentially the twenty eight thousand dollar level
if this were to be a descending triangle, if you're successfully breaking down from the support, you can expect that the price of bitcoin will be making this leg down below this wick over here, as you can see, as the projected move, hitting below 28 000
only if we do manage to create this lower high, if we manage to come back down and consolidate inside of this range between today and tomorrow, it's going to be looking very, very bearish for bitcoin
of course, right now, you know, you could have, you know, these are the two scenarios, guys
do you think bitcoin has created a double bottom and it's going to go to the 32 000 range? i want to know this in the comment section and the poll that i'm going to create right now
and i promise you, i'm going to take a look at the comment section right away and say hello to the community
so i'm going to go super fast and say hello, and and, and read the comments from the people
but do you think bitcoin? bitcoin is creating a double bottom um
and we going, i don't want to make it too long, and we're going to the 32k levels in the next couple of days
do you think bitcoin is creating a double bottom? adam and eve situation? adam and eve pattern
we are going to come and retest the thirty thousand six hundred dollar range in the next coming hours
we're gonna have a breakout, and we're gonna come up to the 32 000 range, which would be the projected move
we start breaking above this ascending channel, and we cannot make the descending triangle because we would have to have a lower high
and come down, you can already create this descending triangle pattern
you might see the balls actually trying to break this resistance
okay, and it does look like, it does look like, let me just zoom in here one second
well, it does look like we could have that, that, um, that potential breakout from this ascending channel
let me just show you here, on the 15minute chart, why there is an ascending channel
already, with these two high highs, you can already create this ascending channel, as you can see, all right
as soon as you have two higher highs, you have a potential base for the channel
this is also basically why you did get this bounce from this zone
you can create that channel with only two highs or two lows, you can start creating a channel
guys, this is something i want to explain also in my course that i will be getting prepared, prepared for the end of the summer
and basically, you can, you know, just by having these two levels, you can already have the channel, all right? you have this touch over here, and you could assume that this support level of this channel can get about
so, yeah, i want to know in the comment section, uh, we got 57 people already saying, yes, this could be a double bottom
is it going to be a double bottom? are we going to hit 30 600 in hours, potentially? or are we gonna get heavily rejected from this zone? okay, remember, it is the 618 from this drop right over here
if we start consolidating inside of this level, descending triangle will be confirmed, and will be very likely going to go to lower levels
and we'll be also finding some trading opportunities inside of this range
of course, by tomorrow, monday live stream, make sure to subscribe to the channel and let's make some cash, baby
let me read the poll, and i'm gonna go through the comment section right away
adam and eve and will be trading at the 32 000 range in the next couple of days, potentially
just a couple of days ago, there were more people that were bearish
as soon as we start getting above this range and start hitting the thirty thousand six hundred dollars, i'm gonna be, you know, i'm gonna start becoming a little bit bullish
i'm gonna say you guys, you know what? this looks pretty bullish
we this might actually break the zone, and we might actually go to these levels, and then we'll be taking those opportunities, of course
you need to learn how to switch from bullish to bearish, because of what the chart does
you know the deal? you've got a lot of people there being extremely bullish
in the mid long term, it's very hard to me to to see bitcoin bearish
during the bear market, accumulate as much bitcoin, well, i mean, of course, not financial advice
accumulate as much bitcoin ethereum, and good projects out there
seb, what are you doing? i just want to know which moderators are here
make sure to smash up the like button, because we're almost 500 people right now watching the live stream
i need you guys to absolutely destroy the like button if you like the content, of course, and supporting the channel for totally free
realistic technical analysis, looking at some major levels and looking for training opportunities, guys
i wanted to take a look at the bitcoin dominance, but this is always mission impossible
i think solana can get heavily rejected if bitcoin doesn't manage to get above this range where we are trading right now, we start being bullish
and we did, you know, if we are going to come down and revisit, okay, this happens 80 of the times
80 of the times when you revisit a low, you are very likely gonna get a shortterm bounce
where do you get that small bounce? we are actually trading, you know, at this zone here, this big zone here, where we did have a large consolidation and also a major reaction as resistance
if bitcoin manages to break above this area of 30, 150 in the next coming hours, then solana, i do see a big chance on solana to actually revisit the 45 all right, in the next, you know, 24 hours, 48 hours, if we do see that bullish momentum on bitcoin
if you start pumping on solana, you know, we have this big, big resistance
it's very possible that you are gonna get that rejection here from the lower high trend line
of course, we've got a major, major level, as you can see also, at the 48, approximately
okay? most important level for solana to break is this last big, major, lower high
so if you do have that price action, you might have that volatility at this range
if you do consolidate on solana at this level, okay, in between 45 and 48 dollars
if you start seeing some wicks here and some failed attempts, you are very likely going to get that correction back down to the 40 level
and then here, you know, who knows, you might be creating an inverse headed shoulder
if we do see that bullish momentum at 48, 40, 45, 48, that is a big, big level here, as you can see on the charts
very likely you're going to get rejected from this lower high trend line, had a failed attempt break out, and continue here, back down to the 40
this is only if we do break above the 40 and start trading in this range, of course, if bitcoin is bullish
so anyway, let me just go through the comment section here, say hello
mods, uh ole oleandi, andy bufor how are you doing? gmt update? joelle, okay, i've got a bunch of people taking, you know, asking for, you know, updates on different altcoins
can you please, um, please, the method you use to choose which crypto is better to analyze? um, which crypto is better to analyze which method, than ones that are less volatile? if you want to trade crypto, i mean, i hardly trade any all coins
of course, if they are all coins that have very low market capitalization, they have huge volatility
i like volatility, but, you know, these big, massive wicks on these or mid cap coins, uh, it's just not worth it because you can make such huge gains just by trading bitcoin and also by trading ethereum, cardano
i would be looking, you know, uh, cardano, polkadot, you know, tron, even avalanche, um, chain link, you know, these ones that do have pretty um, they are large market capitalization
okay, uh, below 100, um, the top 100 in market capitalization, they're just too risky
if you're scalping, scabbing is so, so hard on on all coins, because they're just so volatile with the moves
if you're using a little bit of too much leverage, yeah, you're basically out of the market in no time
so i would go with the top 20, top 30, of course, for for trading
and now we're just gonna, uh, just to go through the comment section
auntie, can you take a look at the, uh, can you analyze the dxy, yeah, absolutely
after gmt, i'll be looking at the dxy, lan, how are you doing? domeig, how are you doing? ethereum, please
hi, andy, what do you think of a butterfly harmonic on ethereum on the four hourly? okay, i've got two people already asking for ethereum
this is just, it's entertainment content, and it's also technical analysis, looking for opportunities of course, no financial advice
i'm just, i'm not gonna take a look at the the comment section anymore because i've already got a bunch of cryptos guys, and it's just, it's mission impossible for me
what is happening to gmt right now? we had this scenario over here where we did have a descending triangle and broke support, created this double bottom
did they take a couple of trades right at these levels, and also one over here
of course, was this descending triangle, massive selling pressure on gmt, right there
uh, you know, analysis on this super, super, super, super easy textbook
you know, we had this break out here of this zone having that volatility, and then, you know, reaching the target of this descending triangle
as you can see the back here is the projected move to that level, expecting that bounce from this 80 cent level, expecting the bounce, very unlikely to, you know, slice straight through
of course, if you go to the one hourly, you already seen that consolidation
you know, very likely going to get that double bottom in the immediate short term, you know, for a potential long opportunity right there
of course, who cares what happened? i want to know what is going to happen in the future
what is the higher probability? and this is why we are analyzing the charts
we have these aggressive lower highs, as you can see inside of this, you know, we had this small the descending triangle right over here
okay, if we do continue with this kind of situation, inside of this descending triangle, selling pressure is absolutely smashing it here on gmt
all right? not a ponzi kind of but, you know, it's a basically a pyramid where you need people coming into the project, okay, coming into the application, into this move to earn cryptos
and i think this is what these cryptos are gonna get, absolutely crushed
how can you get paid with move to earn, unless there's a huge bunch of amount of people, of course, coming in every week? uh, i'll tell you what, people are actually leaving
uh? so, yeah, you need, you basically need to buy these sneakers that are worth a lot, okay? and, yeah, and you need more people coming in
and this is how you actually pay the people that are walking to earn, right? move to earn
this is totally unsustainable, uh, way of of earning money, of course, only you're only going to pay newcomers, uh, old old people that are in the in the application with new people coming in, of course, you know, total pyramid scheme
and, um, i think this one is actually going to continue bearish
of course, we are having the selling pressure here, as you can see, retesting the 80 cent level
this was a major level that we did have a consolidation back here in march
why are we getting these bounces? you can see it on the vp vr
i see so many people, you know, talking about different moving averages on the chart
and you know this, you know, the bollinger bands and the ichimoku clouds are turning blue
you know? no, it's just getting, um, it's just this major consolidation right over here where you did have, look, it's just simple and easy, guys
big resistance at 80 cents back here in march of 2022, just a couple of months ago
guess where you bounce? yeah, you bounce here, right at this level
we were talking about also, this this range over here, the lower highs, this descending triangle
we were getting rejected also, from this major level at the 170 i shorted this range
i did enter a short here, um, because we were looking for that rejection from this level
and, you know, descending triangle right over here, formation
you know, it's, when we were trading at this zone, i was saying, guys, it's just very likely we're gonna have this retest at this low level because of this descending triangle, uh, pattern
uh? so, um, it's but it's basically like everything, you know, you need bitcoin to for the price to go up
but yeah, bitcoin does have solid, solid fundamentals, uh? so, uh, this is the thing, this is the, the probability on on gmt actually breaking this 80 cent level is, is very, very high in the next coming weeks
you know, the end of this apex of this descending triangle is round about the second week of june
so you could still see several days of of um gmt token trading at this range
now, is this guaranteed that it's going to break support? no, of course not
okay, for any people that are new and have absolutely no idea, descending triangle is a bearish pattern usually
okay, i would say 60, 65 percent of the times when you have a formation of a descending triangle, we create aggressive lower highs and a strong base
the probabilities and breaking down are slightly higher, of course
you know, you might have, you know, who knows, you might have tom cruise talking about gmt tomorrow on his twitter account, saying, i've downloaded the app and i bought these shoes
and what could happen? you can have an absolutely explosion to the upside um
but, yeah, looking at the technicals, it is very likely to get rejected from this lower high trend line and continue to continue to the downside, basically
tracy, how are you doing? i can see you in the comment section
scotty, um, how are you doing? uh, can you take a look at cadena? says, roshan, okay, absolutely
but first of all, what is about? what about ethereum? yeah, sammy, i'm taking out take a look at ethereum right away
so, yeah, we're taking a, um, we're taking a look at ethereum, right away, right away
something very interesting that i did do analysis for the bitcoin center's twitter account
of course, if you don't follow us on twitter, make sure to do that
we do share technical analysis ideas and also articles, uh, on on twitter
we've got all our socials down below in the description, guys
why is this a huge level on ethereum? let me just take a look at ethereum
and pretty insanely, yeah, um, shall i go logarithmic? hang on one second
if we take a look at the low levels from march of 2020, which was the c19 event, it was the black swan event, markets were crashing right there to the alltime high, you know, pretty insanely enough
when we had that alltime high here on um, on ethereum, the 7th of march, we had an alltime high hitting above four thousand dollars, four thousand three hundred dollar range
if you take a look at the low, this low over here, the low here from the actual start of the pump, right? because this is a big, major, large consolidation, you know, this is the start of the big, major pump
we we got an insane bounce at the six, one, eight fibonacci retracement from the march 2020 lows to the oldtime highs at the 618, to the to the exact dollar
here how we did get this big, major bounce, you know, to the exact dollar on ethereum, the summer lows, 1 000, not the exact dollar, but, you know, more or less plus minus a few dollars because of the volatility
but you did hold that range, the six, one, eight and okay, past performance, you know, stop taking it
stop taking a look at what happened in the past, and start doing some analysis to kind of predict what could happen in the future
all right, i know maybe a lot of you are thinking that right now
what i want to show you is the fibonacci retracement from the march lows, also to the alltime highs created in november of 2021
and we are also at this range, the 618 and 65, of course, important fib levels where you could consolidate at this range
okay? there is a possibility that if we do break this zone to the downside, if bitcoin is going to be bearish, ethereum's going to be bearish
if we do break the support level at the 1 700, it's going to get very, very messy
my major target here on ethereum would be actually retesting the alltime high from 2018, which is at the 1400 range
i mean, i would say 80 chance there's gonna be a bounce from this level
it was the alltime high here back in um, in in 2018, the high was 1419
close and open large candle here, with some pretty large volume also
if you know, if the price of ethereum comes down to this level, i'm going to, i'm not going to long, i'm going to extreme long
if we do come down there, a lot of people are going to freak out when once we start losing the 1 700 range, if that does happen, of course, i'm not saying it's going to happen, a lot of people are going to start freaking out
this is the moment you want to be ready for an extreme long position
of course, uh, it's going to be a potential small swing trade, because i do see us retesting it back down again
i'm just saying, if it does happen in the next coming weeks, i will be prepared, i will be prepared to to long this range
and, you know, who knows, who knows? uh, this might be bullish
what is bitcoin doing? it's not managing to get above this range
we're getting rejected from the resistance of this ascending channel
who knows? the more time we consolidate here, like i said, the higher probability of us actually getting that rejection in the next 24 hours, of course
we already seen multiple attempts in trying to break this level
several hours, several hours of consultation, will be the moment i'll be bearish
while most, not most, but a lot of the people will think that this is, oh, we are creating a a bull flag, and this is going to absolutely explode to the upside
like i showed you here on bitcoin, there was an insane scalping opportunity here
vpvr, this is the svp, taking a look at the biggest point of control from each day from the 1st of june
we touched it to perfection just a couple of hours ago, hitting the 618
you know, it's a quick scalp opportunity right there, to the 618
if bitcoin does manage to have this bullish momentum, this double bottom that we're talking about, if it does happen, ethereum will be bullish, you know
and what will very likely happen to ethereum is that we are potentially going to reach, okay, this is looking at the four hourly chart on ethereum
we'll be trying to attempt to break this lower high resistance trend line right at this level
we've got a strong range here, which is at the 1 900 right over here
the moment you start breaking this level and this lower high trend line, it's going to be looking very, very good, guys
major trading opportunities if you do have a solid breakout from this zone
very, very um, good trading opportunities if you do have that quick correction for that lego
of course, if bitcoin and it's it's pretty cool, because if i take a look at bitcoin, guys, it's super important to analyze bitcoin and altcoins at the same time, of course, because, um, you know, a lot of the altcoins, you know, follow bitcoin, especially ethereum um, depending on the bitcoin dominance also
but yeah, most, you know, if bitcoins going down, you know, most of the altcoins will follow
they will go down if and if bitcoin goes up, some all coins can actually push up
and i do think ethereum is obviously one of them, being the second largest to follow bitcoin
so bitcoin does manage to create this double bottom, does manage to get above the 618 level from this drop, which i think is unlikely
i think bitcoin will fail to break the 30, 150, remember, the 618
from this drop, we are very likely going to fail to break this zone, and we'll be creating a lower high and still form this descending triangle
you know, i think i'm a 55 60 bearish, thinking that this is going to fail and come down
uh, there is a 40, 45 percent chance, you know, that we actually complete this double bottom
if bitcoin manages to get above the 618, this level over here, it is very likely gonna come back up here to the thirty thousand six hundred dollars, if bitcoin does have that movement
we've got the biggest point of control from the volume trader on the first of june, which is exactly at this level
the most likely scenario for me is getting consolidation, getting rejection here in the next coming hours, and actually continuing to the downside
i need to see some more breaking some levels, some different price action
because, but what do you do when you you are 50 50? you don't trade
but this was a scalp it doesn't matter where you at, because you're basically gonna jump in a trade and take profits in less than an hour, potentially
but i, i mainly do day trades and swing trades 80, 90 of the times
and if you were to ask me right now, i would say, i'm i don't want to trade this
i don't want to trade it because you have the two scenarios that i do have on the thumbnail
and there is also the rejection here at the 618 from this drop
so got that rejection here, getting this consolidation at the six, one, eight, uh? i am leaning slightly, like i said, on the bearish side of creating a this continuation of this descending triangle, which would be very, very bearish if we do get this rejection from this level
and i can see in the comment section there are people that are slightly more bullish
do you think bitcoin is creating a double bottom and we are going to go to 32k levels? from 400 votes, i have 58 of people that are bullish
oh, there's people are slightly more bullish than bearish, uh, like so anyway, going with ethereum, guys
you know, if you, if you, and if you want to take a look at all coins, it should be ethereum
it should be one of the strong, strong, uh, strong um altcoins
if bitcoin, if bitcoin were to finally break this range, come here to the 30 600, i can give you the projected move, approximately, of what ethereum could do
and if bitcoin does go to thousand six hundred dollars, and make sure to take a look at ethereum, because i can give you the almost the exact projected move that ethereum will do
and that would be coming down to the one thousand nine hundred dollars
if bitcoin is trading in the net coming hours at thirty thousand six hundred dollars ethereum will be trading at one thousand nine hundred dollar range, okay? or maybe slightly below
it will be trading at this level where we'll be getting the rejection
we do have support level right over here, and we also got a lower high trend line
what will happen if you do hit this range? i will tell you right now
if we start having that price action to the upside, i'm going to be, look, i i will be quite bullish in the short term
it is very likely, after this attempt, you will be successfully creating a double bottom
and we if you are trading here at this range at the 30 600, it is very likely going to have that leg up to 32 000 range
and if you do see that happening on bitcoin, uh, in the next coming hours, few days, if you do see this kind of movement, you are going to see this movement for ethereum, you're going to have that stop at this big level, okay, the 30 the, sorry, the 1 900 range
from these lower highs, bitcoin trading at thirty thousand six hundred dollars
bitcoin, if it does have that breakout and starts trading at thirty two thousand dollars and slightly above that range, we are going to see some pretty nice bullish momentum on ethereum, potentially hitting the top of this range at the 2150
and, uh, you know, i will come back to the stream and say, you know, just to that for the projected move you know, bitcoin at 30 500, 30 600, ethereum at 1 900
now, that is the two legs if this, if um bitcoin were to complete this adam and eve double bottom scenario
double bottom for bitcoin? 59 percent of people say, yes, absolutely
can you take a look at cadena, please? says, star wars worlds absolutely
i mean, i'm leaning slightly to the, to the, to the bearish side
if we start breaking above here, the 30 150 zone, the 618 from this drop, and start, you know, pumping to thirty thousand three hundred, thirty thousand four hundred, uh, i'm going to start leaning slightly bullish, guys
cadena is looking, uh, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, uh, bearish and boring
it's just gonna, like i said, i am, i am bullish in this project for the long term
this is what happened after this massive, after the massive, aggressive drop in 2018
it was just boring, boring price action for a lot of the all coins
of course, you will get those relief pumps where people will fomo in a little bit, get over excited
but it's very, very likely going to be, you know, multimonthly bear market
you know, we're looking for six, 18 months, um, which is going to be very boring
we'll be looking for trading opportunities and looking for good projects
we'll be stacking up bitcoin ethereum together, and we'll be making huge gains in the next coming years
billions and billions and billions and billions and billions, guys, um, this is gonna be it for this live stream
not much to add here in the in the i've got my dog scratching the dog right now
i mean, if bitcoin is going to be bullish, i'm really bullish on this project
there is a possibility that we are actually forming a gartly pattern here
um, [Music], yeah, not much to add in the short term here on on cadenna
i think this one can actually come down to retest the lows at the 150
and you know, if you are bullish on it on cadena, are you looking for to trade it? i'm a little bit cautious, of course, in trading some all coins at the moment um, only focusing on bitcoin ethereum and some larger, traditional markets
it's going to enter a large consolidation, in my opinion, you know, a vshaped recovery in the next coming months, of course, is very unlikely
i will be doing live streams every single day from monday to friday
this is gonna be my goal with it will be and it will be in the morning
i'm looking for nine o'clock, ten o'clock, approximately central european time
remember, you've got insane bonuses on primex bt and also on buybit
if you want to take advantage of those bonuses, you got them down below
check out bitcoins website for the latest news, technical analysis, ideas
so today we're gonna go through, we're gonna go through monday and see, um, [Music] what can potentially happen this week
hello, how are you? angelo gertep mate, hello, how are you? are you? dele matt? matt, notebook in hand and ready for the study session
please go inside and like the live stream before we go into the charts
peter miguel, hello, how are you? is everything okay with you? okay, we can go into
okay, so, uh, next week we're gonna see if we have some potential news coming out
monday we got a lot of, oh, okay, monday will be all day, all day, all day
tuesday, we only have a little bit in the morning, a one small news coming out
so i don't think it, i don't think it will affect the market so much
okay, so we don't have anything special, uh, when it comes to news on usd uh, until friday, we have something, some small ones coming out on thursday
but it's always good to look at what the market can give you before hello
okay, so we can go into the charts on bitcoin and see what can potentially happen this week
so i don't, i haven't changed anything when it comes to the to the chart since friday, i think we were looking at dxi
um, the thing is, when it comes to to the dollar now, i do believe that we, we can actually continue back down a little bit, because if we look at the daily chart, we have a fibonacci, i have it on the lower time frames
but another thing that we also can see is that two days, okay? so this candlestick will open up tomorrow or today, in a couple of hours
and when we come back up and retest the preview support like this within with a hanging man um, this is definitely, for me, a sign that we will actually continue back down
that kind of makes sense when, hello george, how are you? uh, when we look at the lower time frames and we connect the the previous lower, high, uh, oh, sorry
and if the dollar drops, because i still believe that we need to come back down to potentially 100 865 for then see the market slowly instead, it reverse back up
how can i procreate your stigma and losing every day? practice the charts
and that's good, because i will be having a back testing stream
so you can just look at what i'm what i do, and you you practice that on your own charts
so if we, if we look at txi, it looks like we can be, um, uh, bearish
and if we look at, hello, samir, how are you? lister 333, we go to the higher time frames
i'm just quiet now because i just want to do it without talking
so, you know, remember a couple of, a couple of weeks ago, when i said that we were supposed to feel this week, and so many people said, no, look what happened
we came back down exactly to the targets, to the levels where i expected us to come back down to, which is really good
and we are right now retesting the three monthly, uh, 618 percent at 26 340
um, i still believe that we will continue back down, obviously
i i do believe that we just might also see the market break it a little bit
because if you're looking at the monthly chart, you have such, you have such volatile volatility to the downside
so for the market to just reverse from nowhere, i don't think that
um, slowly, steady, it will definitely happen, but i think it will look something like this, you know, slowly and steady, we we continuous up
so when we're looking at the monthly chart, i do believe that this, during this month, this candlestick, at the end of june, we will be down here
i will never tell you when to sell, or when to do something, or going to a trade and close the trade
i only share my my experience, or what i see, nothing more than that
we still believe, or i still believe, that we can come back down to 25 300, potentially at around these levels, maybe see the market break down a little bit more
so what i do when i, when i analyze the charts like this, it's just because this is how i read the candlesticks
so why i go through three months? we just break everything down
that's how, in my brain, i can, i can figure out how the candlestick on the lower time frames would work
what is going on? is it better now? lauren, you saw my face when i read good
i was like, is it better now? confirm? is it better really? [Music], hello, it's so annoying
can't you hear me now? now someone needs to tell me, is it okay or not with a microphone? no problem, lauren, no, no, it's good
[Music], is it better now? maybe if i have the microphone a little bit closer
um, still a very volatile candlestick that we did have, uh, since before, uh, was this to okay, so we do have another two weekly candles, candle
so we do have another two weekly candlestick opening tomorrow, or in 4 hours and 32 minutes
i want to use these wicks, and i just want to see how it looks on them
we're gonna adjust it a little bit so we can clear, everyone can clearly see that we are in a sideways market right now, but we are inside the fibonacci on the heart, the three monthly fibonacci
and that is between 32 480 [Music] and we and the other one is at also the 60, 51 of 50, or 61, 26 300, around that level
so what i do, overall, expect the market to do is obviously bouncing between these levels
if we from nowhere, would see the market actually reverse back up in the to where we have the price at the moment
and i would also want the market to to break the 50 percent at 32, is it 1050? yeah, the 50, the 50 at 32 000 and let's say 500
now, this is, this is if bitcoin would potentially be bullish from nowhere
so if you were on my live stream a couple of days ago, no, was it yesterday, we did speak about the, we did speak about the demand zone
so we do have a supply zone, and we're gonna use it from the, from the, we're gonna use it on the daily chart
and so i dragged the box from 31 707 back up to the week and that is also combined exactly with the 50 at 32 427
which means that if we see that, uh, bitcoin potentially could be bullish now, because i do believe that we will have it pushed back up, we can come inside these people, not at this supply zone, and then see the market reverse back down again
this is definitely something that can happen, because we broke this little, uh, downtrend that we did have with broke above
if we drag a fibonacci from the from the low to the high, we are right now inside fibonacci levels are between 30 170 and 29 770
and if we go down to the lower time frames, they pull, uh, the the pull back
this is what we this is what we're looking at right now on the four hourly the market created lower lows, lower highs
okay, so when we're inside the fibonacci levels, now, what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna drag, if another fibonacci from 29602, uh, back up to 29885
so what potentially can happen now, uh, till tomorrow, is that we could see the market pull back down to 20, around 29 780, potentially 29 750
and this could be the beginning, um, to these levels, or around, potentially 31 000 to 700
and we can also, i don't think that we will come up to, uh, to 32 400, uh, because if we're gonna use this as a supply zone, usually what happens is that the market, uh, you will see the market closing below the demand zone, candle, and then see the market reverse back down
um, but definitely, uh, what we're looking at at the moment here is a a pull back down and then a continuation to the upside, right? um, it's not valid
and so yeah, this is definitely something that i would first of all look at so as always, we drag a, or i drag a trend line like this
so if the market pull back down to it, um, we will have a alert
we're just gonna need to see and wait and see if the market is gonna do that
so, but if we, but obviously, if we see that you have a bigger push to the downside, and we see more volatility, we can definitely come back down, first of all, to the support, again, around 29 500
and from that level we decide if, uh, where i decide if i'm going to short the market, or go long on the market, or do nothing
but if it doesn't have the power to come up to these levels, we can see if we find another zone that we can retest
so this is also, this is also a a scenario that we can have, is that, because we're right now retesting also a fibonacci as a lower high
if we see that the market breaks below 29 817, and the market creates a lower low, because we need to surpass the previous
um, higher low that and the market pulls back up to create a lower high
um, but the only thing that i'm yeah, we just have to wait and see
um, when the market comes to these levels, or whatever they choose to do
um, i will take a decision from there, because it's really hard
now, when the market is very slow, and i don't go, i i don't go in and, you know, trade the market the first thing that i do
and, but if we also close like this, we're just taking everything away
we do close with an inverted hammer, also against levels where you've seen the market reversed so many times before
i definitely believe that this um, the beginning of this week, will be bullish
so usually what the market does when we usually fill the wake
maybe not the whole week, but if you go back in time, can you see right here? this was the same scenario that happened
but it was easier for me to take a decision here based on that we had the market pulling back down to the a previous demand zone
and then that was also, you you saw the market giving you the inverted uh hammer two times
so that for me, was definitely a confirmation that we would see the market push to the upside um
everything depends, right? but that is, it's definitely, it's definitely, we can definitely push back up to these levels
and remember what i said, this is a, this is a supply zone also, also
so fill the wick that we have on the weekly chart, first of all, this candlestick right here, on the daily it looks better
so we can definitely, first of all, see the market pull back up to 32, 350
if we see a break and retest, continuation to the upside, the market shows us
so this is what i see right now on ethereum, uh, thank you so much guys
we're gonna continue, but i just want to say, welcome everyone to this live stream
i've been doing it every single day, so that is why it looks so simple when i do it
i'm here to i just want to share my, my own experience with you guys
so if you're looking for a youtube channel where you can have free access to very good ta, my platform is the best for that
you can use this on index, on forex, on oil, gold, everything that i do when it comes to ta, you can use that on every chart
we're gonna go through some other coins too, before we go back and go deep into the back testing session
but if you want to go back, i did trend lines a couple of days ago and etc
uh, i do go through a lot with when it comes to the fibonacci supply and demand
i i hope a lot of people learned more about supplying the man zones, because it's really important when we use them on the charts
so if you are a beginner and want to sit and practice alone, um, you can go to crypto trading for beginners
market structure, part one and part two is always the ones that i that i push
because if you don't understand these, uh, if you don't understand this, i mean, you can obviously understand the other ones too, but market structure is like the basic of trading
hit the notification so you know, because we also have monday live streams
i don't know exactly where you live, but i guess you can find out when london session opens for you
so remember, one hour before that, you will also have the notification on youtube
and you can also be part of, uh, the bitcoin census community with me, if you want to have a a closer relationship to me when it comes to trading
and you have a, you have so many other wonderful people, very good traders
and lauren will soon give you the link to that, um telegram group in just one second in the live chat
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to 4 000 and 50 through bitcoin census
it's really good one, especially when it comes to swing trading, because you can have the very low fees
so this happens on every every time frame when you have the inverted hammer, especially at a high the market will definitely break down
and this was also something that i was talking about a couple of weeks ago
i strongly believe that we can also push back down to the to the sixty one point eight percent, around one thousand four hundred and eighty
with this huge candlestick that we do have on the three monthly chart, it is 25 days left
so at the end of june, we will have a new threemonth account candlestick
it's gonna be a little bit exciting to see where how this will end, how this candlestick will close
so now when we go down to the lower time frames, this is where we start to find where, uh, good
on the monthly, you don't really use those levels because you cannot see them, um, so much
so why i did highlight this level on the three month at three weekly chart is because this is a previous support
so if we would see a pull back up, um, on also on bitcoin and on ethereum, obviously we can pull back up to 2140
and if that happens, remember that this is a very strong level that we come back up and retest
so that could only be where the market needs to pull back up to to retest this price for then see the market drop even more, right? oh, no, steve
this is like the first green candle if we even close like this
so if we just go back in time, the 50 on the threemonth chart is exact
if can you see how when we just scaled down everything to the lower time frames? can you see how perfectly the market did respect these levels before we even knew the market would come back down and have this as a higher low
and the previous support that we did have is also exactly where the 50 is
so this is also a level um at the fifty percent, at one thousand nine hundred
we need to focus on that price before we're talking about two thousand one hundred and thirty
drag your feet from high? no, we just dragged fibonacci from the last high at 1996 back down to the low at 1773
so for the market, combined with the daily fibonacci 1884 and 1911, is really important levels for us to use if we see that the market pulls back up to these levels, which i definitely believe can happen
guys, please give me some support, because everyone's so quiet today
okay, so on the lower time frames, now, if we would see the market pull back up to these levels, we do the same thing
and if we go down to the lower time frames, now, the same thing that we will do
so we drag a fibonacci from 1777, to be precisely, back up to 1822
that gives us a if we see the market pull back down, we could see them
and then slowly steady, we could see the beginning for the market to pull back up
and okay, so if that is the case, take profit one would be 1832
take profit two will be 1856, and take profit three will be 1 876
but obviously, what would you expect the market to do is pull back up to 1 900
but we can obviously have a scenario where you see the market doesn't have the power to break up to these levels
so what we can do at that time, um, if we see that the market would close below this support channel, this resistance trend line, this is, this is where the magic starts to happen
and we can also highlight the higher low, the last higher low, in the small option that we have
so we could see the market pull back down to 1787 and 1783, and still see the market pull back up
but if we break this level, we will also break the previous higher low, which tells us that this could be the break of structure
and that is really important, because if we break the structure, this could be only a fake out
so the the clue for us to see, pretend, because you you never know 100 obviously
but if you see that, okay, this is definitely fake out, that's when we see, if we break below 1783, and you see the market giving you a recess around, you know, the same level, with huge bearish candlesticks, it will tell you, hey, this level will not be valid
so that is why it's also very important to to just wait for the confirmation
so don't go into a trade right away, and especially if you are not so used to it, um
but you should always know what to do when when you when you train right? not always
obviously, you need to practice it, because to become better, but have a strategy
and that is why market structure is really good to understand when it comes to my, my, uh, my videos, because i explained it very easily how to use them, but also how important it is to use okay, do you guys want me to look at any other coins? or do you want me to go directly to the charts? because no, you know what? we're gonna go directly to the charts and practice
because the other coins, just let the market do whatever it's supposed to do during today, because many of them already
we look at the pairs and then we go and then we go to the to the back testing
you already told me that you knew that your um analyzes words were correct with mine
what this is where you think the market will come to? only that one? what? okay, let's see what i can find
so so i i like to use the end of the week that we had from last month or weekly, because when the market comes to these levels too, the market will also react into it in some way
and if we go back to the monthly chart, we can also see that would you have, so i'm not gonna highlight this is pretty big, i think
and that is used as make no sense to have it like that, to be honest
i'm gonna take that one away, and we're gonna focus on [Music]
so we're gonna, we're gonna use the trend line, because trend lines is really good to use overall when it comes to trading um
so one of the things when it comes to inverted hammers also, you i mean, we, we can definitely fill this wick, but it doesn't have to fit the whole week, right? so when we go down to the 15 minutes chart, what i do is that i use this supply zone right here
so i drag a box from 5956 back up to the wick, and that should be at 61145
so even if we see that the market is breaking this resistance trend line, we can only come back up to this level, and then you see the reverse back down
you know what? when it comes to supply and demand zones, these are crazy
like, when i just think about it, when i back tested it before, the market is respecting these levels so much
and i know there's so many good traders that use supply and demand zones, and by my own experience, is also really good
and this is definitely, this week, i would use the supply and demand zone so much
and i did practice it a little bit before today, and it also works on the lower time frame
so i definitely, if you are new to trading, or if you don't, use supply and demand zones, just for my, you know, from me to you, practice it
practice applying the man songs and go back to my previous live stream that i did have yesterday
um, when it uh, um, supplying demand zones, because they are really good
do you understand what i talk about? so if we see the push back up and break 544, the market can come up to these levels at 5957 and potentially 6145
if we break these levels, we can come up to six points and six point nine 293 and six point four hundred and six
and if we also use a fibonacci from 7364 back down to 418, uh eight one, uh twenty, this is also combined with the fibonacci between six point seventy five and six point three hundred and ninety three
so these are definitely levels where a a drop can happen again, and we can come back down to the support at 46, 670 80
but these are definitely the first levels that i look at when it comes to near
also have a twitter account, and every single day, me and andy and our lovely sammy
of course, that takes care of peers of twitter, but sometimes me and andy also give out, uh, content
when it come to matic we do have two different, uh, two important levels to look at, and it is demand zone, supply and demand zones
and if we go to the higher time frames, i already have it as a setup, was that the weekly no, that was the daily
so if we see the drop back down, we can definitely, we can definitely, yeah
so if we see the continuation down overall, so this is long term, we can come back down to 0380
and if we go to the daily, you can also see that this is a preview support
we're still below the the resistance trend line, which means that we're still in a downtrend
if we go back in time, as you see, we broke your previous support
so i also now created, so you can see the market created a support, right? so we can definitely have a push back up
one thing that i also have in mind, uh, zero point six hundred and twenty five
if we go to the higher time frames, this is the close of a previous week, right? so i still want to use this one
if you go down to the lower time frames, can you see how perfectly you can see that the daily did respect these levels as a support
we broke below the exact same level again, retested it perfectly
so if we see that the market comes back up to 0622, this could definitely be where you see the market drop also
but if we break above it, go into the lower time frames, you can also see it holding it as a new support, right? and then if we break the resistance trend line, we could, potentially, we could potentially, okay, let's see
this is also a zone where we can come back up to, and that is potentially between 0658 and 0676, supply zone
remember, when we break uh trend lines, the market is usually faking us out
so if we see a break, we want to look at the candlesticks that comes after the breakout, candles, candle or candles
so if we start to see that we do have bigger movements, bigger bearish candlesticks to the downside, that is definitely the market only came back up and retested the previous uh supply zone
and then you see the drop back down if we break above this level
because this is technically also, this is also a previous lower high, but i would want to use this one
but if we break it, and we potentially can only come back down to resist it as a higher low, this could be pushed back up to zero point seven hundred and thirty and zero point seven hundred and sixty sixty eight, because that is the fifty and sixty one percent, sixty one point eight percent
at fifty percent, based on the higher time frames fibonacci, where a lower high can be created, and then see the drop
but first of all, but first of all, we need to focus on these levels and the break of the resistance
because whatever happens here, we don't care about that unless we're breaking these levels, right? so we need to go through some levels before we see, see matic push back up
that was all, these were the only two books that i've ever read in my whole life
uh, when it comes to candlestick bible, i actually translated that
um, i never read it after i i wrote it, because i learned so much while i was writing it
after that, i bought some courses, and i practiced myself, because practice yourself is the key
it doesn't matter how many courses or many books you read, you still have to do everything on the charts
um, i'm not gonna, i'm not, um, i'm not gonna analyze this fight like this
dt, do we have some setups on salon already? oh, what did i do with this one? two daily chart
uh, back up to potentially 4252 or put 4364, go down to the lower time frames
that is kind of combined with the lower low that you can see, but usually the market is not retesting it perfectly
so if we have a a fibonacci slightly above the previous lower low, this can definitely be where the market pull back up
also, combined with the trend line, you can see the returns and then see the drop
i remember, a long time ago, not so long time ago, but a couple of months ago, everyone was crazy
and i think, i think link also was something that, um, andy really liked
did someone say that bitcoin were pumping? you can go into bitcoin soon
so we can, we can see push back up to, i got four different levels when it comes to link
if we break that level, we can reach to nine point twenty three dollars
and nine points and ninety four dollars too push and then potentially see a drop from these levels
uh, what else you want me to look at? so, um, if anyone look at this later, no, i will create, sorry guys, i will create timestamps when the back testing starts, so when you want to go back, you know exactly where the back testing is
how are ya everyone? sebzep is starting his new work tomorrow
so everyone on bitcoin senses should support the best subset, the only subset we got
i remember that you will have a great a a, a new work tomorrow
uh, we would you have a previous support? also, the market has been very boring
if we see the market pump up like that, i seriously don't like this chart
also, the market is in a sideways market, right? and so if we don't, if we see the market pull back down to, uh, the support, i'm gonna use this previous support
so we can pull back down either to 18 points, around 18 points, 57, around these levels, also, 2384
but if we break the resistance, we can pull back up to 257, to 2 and potentially 2755 for a reverse back down
if this doesn't happen and we break below 1857, we could potentially see a retest and then see the market drop back down to potentially this the previous support, around 1126
but the most important thing is that when we are in a sideways market, what we still have to have in mind is that this is not allowed to happen, or it can definitely happen
but if you see it happen, if you see the break, and then the next candlestick around the support becomes very bullish, this could only be a fake out, as you see here
and this is why i use the preview support, because this support was where the market tried to break to create a potential break and retest, but it never had the power to do that
so that is why i use this previous report, because the market usually is retesting the same the support before the fake out in this case
so that is why i say that what are you talking about still live? oh, steve, yes, of course
i don't even know what you're gonna work with, uh, sam, but it feels like you can be a pilot or something
okay, we're gonna go to bitcoin again because it was something that someone said the market pumped
can you stop saying the market is pumping when it's not? it hasn't moved one bit
what are you seeing that i don't? i do pull it, but i'm getting free
we're gonna take two more uh, we we're gonna take two more coins
so the so the first two coins that is getting written in the chat now, i will look at, as long as they're not this the same ones that i've been looking at
then we go to the back testing part, because that is the most fun one
brent wants me to look at avox, and wayne wants me to look at eleven
please give me the likes for the live stream so we can reach out to more people
and we can reach out to people that need the help when it comes to trading
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, please going inside and do that, because i do have daily updates about cryptocurrencies every single day
uh, swedish time, so that is one hour before london session, every single day, monday to friday
we just go through the charts together to see the setups, so we know exactly what could potentially happen during the day
if you are new to trading, go down and look at my crypto trading for beginners market share for part one and part two
you choose whatever, but i would definitely look at these ones
i had with supply and demand zones, trend lines and the other ones
and a lot of uh with fibonacci, if you haven't, if you don't know, you can also receive a bonus on bible
it's up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
okay, so continue with avox and then waves, and then we're gonna do the back testing
and this is the good thing, when you back test with me, you can go to your own charts then and look at your coins, because that is freedom, guys
okay, so when it comes to albux, i use a preview support that we did have since april 2001, because that one makes more most sense to where we are at the moment
this actually makes sense from 20 okay, so february last year
as long as we're below this trend line, we're still in a downtrend technically
when it comes to the higher time frames, we can still come back up and retest these low, this previous low, and we're still in a downtrend, right? the market is, right now, on the weekly chart, creating, potentially a lower low
if we start to see a pullback on the higher time frames, if that will look like we're breaking from everything
you know, you can we believe the market will have this huge movement, but in real life, the market is only creating a lower high for then, you know, drop again
but we go down to the lower time frames just to connect everything together
we also have a previous support, support and resistance zone to daily right here
so obviously, before, if we think the market will reach these levels, we have to break so many different levels, uh, before that
so where that's why we're focusing on what's actually happening right here, so you can see how clearly the market created lower lows and lower highs
and you can see that this leg right here closed above so this is technically a demand zone, which you could see the market retested, right? and we're also going to use, we're also going to use a trend line on the daily chart
and can you see how the market is right now, retesting it? uh, perfectly
because if that is the case, because we are right now trying to break this level, right? and with that, i want to, if we see the market creating a higher high and then see the market drop a little bit
what i'm going to do is that i'm going to use this low at 2427 to the high the market will give us, potentially, if it, if it does um at that point, i will have fibonacci levels that can take me up to the higher time frames fibonacci for then see the reverse back down
so this is how i connect the fibonacci, uh, levels with each other
so this could definitely be a push um for us to retest these levels
and remember that this is also a previous support, also a previous resistance, but it's the lower, high um resistance
so if we break it, we can also come back up and retest the trend line
if we break this trend line that we have on the higher time frames, that could take us back up to 5143 or 5650
so wave usdt is the last one that we will look at, and then we're gonna start with the back testing session in now, starting up with the higher time frames
we're gonna take everything away so everything makes sense for me
so i did highlight this previous, uh, support, preview support, that you can see that on the monthly chart
so if we cannot break above 913, that is because this is a, this is a monthly support
okay, so if we also use the fibonacci, from a last lower high at 1554, back down to the support at 435, um market pushed exactly up to the fibonacci levels at 9924 and 1131
remember this line, 913, is the previous high, time frame support, or the monthly so this is a very strong level
and what we also can do, it doesn't look that good, but the last, the last higher low was above the monthly chart
so if we see, if we see that waves pulls back up to potentially 910, between 910 and 946, this could be where the market creates the lower high
based on this fibonacci, even though i'm no financial advisor, target 1 is 760, say profit 2 is 643, and take profit 2 is 544
so as i told you, we can definitely see the push back up to these levels
and to see the the move happening on the lower time for higher time frames, first you will see, the more you will see waves break this resistance trend line
and if we break above 87, to see 74, market can pull back down and then see the push, right? so we need to break this resistance trend line, because you can see the market creates lower lows and lower highs
but if we break that level, okay, we can say that technically the last lower highs at 851, but it's such a small one
but we can break that level and still come back down and retest this lower height, the last lower high, and then see the push
and now we're gonna look at ada before we go into the back testing
so okay, so we are right now trying to retest a previous resistance trendline
and we can use the push back down between two hundred and 06250, eight and zero point
and if you, if we, if i start to see that we have volatility to the downside, and we're close below the trend line again, you can see rita's from below
or i that could be the market um not having the power to reach these fibonacci levels at zero point six thousand seven hundred and ninety three and zero point seven thousand three hundred and ten, because the market needs to, market will try to retest this high before we reaches these ones
and this line that i have at zero points point seven thousand five hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that is a previous low
if we also go to the higher time frames, was it on the monthly chart? i think, what was it? okay, whatever it is, it is a previous low also
so we'll just wait for the market to try to push up to these levels
but if we see the market having the volatility, that is definitely from the sign that we are continuing to be bearish
but first of all, me and sub sub wonders, where guys are you from? my name is natalie
i know we have some people from, um, where do we have? uk, india, oh, belgium, dubai, south korea
i live in spain, but enter it and ikea and have been trapped here for three years
uh, i just need to go to the bathroom before we go into the to the charts
okay, seb step and lauren can entertain you, but while i'm gone
who? sep sep? you got a new name? what? one? one, one in a funny accent
who is, uh, who are ready for some back testing? i hope that you got your brain
if you are ready for some back testing, put one, one in the chat
so is there anything special that you want me to go through? because i've been going through trend lines
i've been going through, uh, what else did i go through? [Music], supply and demand zones
darren, so if there's anything special, but i will only look at the things that i already know
so if you want me to look at an indicator or anything, i'm not, i will only do that on the things that i already know, obviously, because you i don't know everything when it comes to ta, but i know the good things
i love the smooshy things, you know, when it comes to back testing
and i'm not sure if i want to turn up the lights, because i really don't like the lights
is there anything special that you want me to go through? is it supporters? oh my god
dave was like, no, he's really taking some time off the chats
but we missed you, tomeshu, is there anything special that you want me to go through? supporting resistance zones, trend lines, um fibonacci, etc
we're obviously gonna connect everything together either way, because that's how it's easier for us
but if you don't have anything special, we're just gonna go into the charts and, you know, just see what we what we see
okay? waking souls want us to use fibs, and matthew want us trend lines
and that is really good, because that's usually, this is how we usually, or i take my entries also, based with the support the trend lines and the fibonacci
so if we go back to the live stream, we spoke about this inverted hammer
so if you want to see the tas that we did on bitcoin, because now we will start with the bat with the back testing session
we will only look at the the charts and back test it so we know how to trade the market when the market is live
it feels like a, you know, i know exactly what happened to bitcoin from the 15minute charts
when it comes to trend lines, we can use, uh, we can, we use, we can start up with trend lines a little bit
so when it comes to trend lines, the trend lines is really good when we try to figure out where the market is
i'm gonna, i'm gonna make you not being able to to write in the chat because i'm getting so distracted
so i'm gonna put 200 seconds, and if you really want to ask me something, you can definitely do that
i really want to see what you're writing, but now it's study time
so when it comes to trend lines, um, we're gonna do this again
when it's an uptrend, it is always the higher lows that is maintaining a uptrend
okay? it doesn't matter how the higher highs looks, as long as the higher lows is is not broken
we're still looking at the market in the options when it comes to the downtrend, when it comes to the downtrend, we always connect the trend with the lower highs
so don't, don't try to to um, to fight the rules when it comes to it, right? so uptrend, we connect the dots with the higher lows
and if we would see the market try to fake us out, in this case, on any option, and you see that we're breaking above the trend line, and then you see the market, uh, continues to break down
what we need to do when it comes to the trend line, we need to adjust the trend line to the last lower high
you cannot have a trend line looking like this, because the next time the market tries to come and retest this trend line, it will only retest the market, uh, where the price uh, it will always, uh, respect the previous price
so it will not respect this trend line, because this is, this price is not, um, the one the market would want to to retest, right? so if the market pulls back up now, and you see the market retest the trend line based of this lower high
that's how you spot the next potential drop or break, retest the continuation
if we see that the higher low, try to we can come back down and retest the previous higher low, and then you see the market break above again
we need to correct the trend line based on that fake out, because it did break the support trend line, but then it came back inside again
so what we're gonna do is that we're gonna adjust the trend line, uh, to the to the previous uh to the new high low
and the same thing that we spoke about when it comes to the lower highs is that if we don't change the trend against the previous with the price the the you will not see the correct move the market does
so when you use this previous high low, you could either see the market come back down and retest it and then see the continuation
but if we break it, it's also very important because we need to look at the previous higher low
if you see the break, it reaches from below this trend line will not be valid anymore
or if we break it, come back up and retest it from above, market goes down
uh, what time frame do you use from high to low? i usually use to go on the higher time frames because the market always, always, always, always respect the higher time frames trend lines more
so in this case, if we just look at bitcoin on the weekly chart, we can just identify that
so we can now connect the dust, because we cannot, okay, we can obviously do this, but we also have to have in mind that the market is not going straight up the whole time
and when we see the break of structure of this trend line, because the last um, the last lower high, was this lower high, right? because market continued to create another lower low
we broke the previous low low, created another lower low, and then you saw the market breaking structure
so when the market is pushing back up and we see that the market is slowly starting to reverse, this is also, this is also where we use the fibonacci to calculate
okay, where can the next higher low be but we can only use the trend line when the higher low is created and you see the push, because that is giving you a valid high low, right? but then if we take back, take away the fibonacci, because we need to focus on the trend line
um, you have different trend lines everywhere, right? um, because if you only gonna use this one, you will wait forever to see the break
so this one, when you see the push, we can definitely use this trend line when you start to see the market reverses back down to it again
because it is all is usually the third touch when it comes to trend lines
you saw, this was kind of the second touch, the third touch, and then you saw this huge push
so i did look at this trend line, and i remember i saw the market at these, uh, candlesticks, when you saw this huge drop, based also with the fibonacci
but this trend line, you will not look at the trend line unless you see the price reaching it, um, because then we can use another trend line based on this huge push that we did
have to try to connect the dots, right? so you see the market creating small higher lows
and then when i go down to the lower time frames, potentially the four hourly, what i do is that i just adjust the trend line against the the four hourly, because you can see how perfectly the market is
then when we connect the dots from this push that we did, come back down and retest the higher time frames
can you see how how perfect the market is retesting these levels? okay, so from this push, we connect the dots together, market is just going up, up, up, up, up
and then when we finally break it, because you you need to follow it like this, so we're just going to start over
so we're expecting the market to create the higher lows, right? not when to check bathroom titles
you can obviously see that when we connected these, uh, these higher lows together, you, you then saw the market break
but what we do, because we know that the market can reverse, so we that's when we use the fibonacci
then you start to see the market consolidate, and then you see the market break the support trend line because we adjusted after the higher lows, right? so technically this was the higher low that would break
but remember that the overall, we knew from the weekly charts that the market from these levels came inside a fibonacci level
so only just because we see, just because we see the market pull back down, doesn't mean the market will, you know, change forever
so when we see the break of this trend line, remember that this trend line, we need to break it because the market will give you bigger pullbacks, right? and if we use the fibonacci now, combined with the trend, okay? even if you break the trend, the second thing that we have in our mind is that the market is pulling back
it needs, could potentially pull back down to these fibonacci levels for them see the push
so when we see this high low being created, what do we do? can anyone tell me
okay? so someone can tell me, what? what do i do from here? what do i do from here? what are what? what am i doing with the trend? so when i see that the market created this high low, what do i do with the trend line? this is where you need to have your brain
it's okay to have if you if you didn't, we adjust the trend line exactly to where move it down to the next higher low, right? and the next higher low is this high low
because we saw the market pull back down to the 50 percent, this is where the higher low could be expected, exactly
and you can see that what? and when we use the trend line, we try to connect it with as many as many candlesticks as possible, but never cut it
so from this higher low, you can see how close i push the trend line to, as long as not no cutting, no candlesticks at all
and the next time you see the market pull back down to these levels
can you see how perfectly the market retest that exact price, that exact price, only because we were so accurate with this higher low? and then what happened when you finally saw the break of structure? we just need to connect the dots
okay? so we saw this huge push to the upside, right? market push back up so much, then we need to go to the left, because we don't know
that's our goal, right? market is using, okay, this fibonacci, target one, target two
hey, we're actually coming back up to the previous alltime high that bitcoin had at the time, right here, right? is the echo still there? is everything? okay, kindly mention the prices, not all
[Music], is it better now? is it better? is it better? is it better? is it better? is it better? so fun
i just wonder what 114 people would do if i chose to scream, as i just finally thought, you know, okay, continue
so you're not allowed to write, because i will get distracted, and especially when it comes to sub sub
okay, will the market create another high low and then continues, etc
but when you see the market pull back up to the previous alltime high, i remember this so well
there was so many people that started to buy bitcoins, a bitcoin right here
and especially when you come to previous alltime high, we need to start to think that this could definitely be where the market have a bigger pool back down, at least a higher low
this was something that we did back test before, right? so when the market gives us one higher low, the next higher high, this is how we connect the fibonacci
so what we want the market to do is obviously to come back down to the previous support, to the 50 and 61 percent, at this case, between 54 530 and 51 827
so this were, this was where we could potentially see the market creating the higher loafer than create another high high
but we don't know if this is going to happen on or not, right so, but we're going to take that one away because we're, we were supposed to look at this
so when we see that the market pull back up, what can we do? we can try to use a just for fun now, just because we can do it
we use the close of the body from 57 935 on the monthly chart, back up to the week that is betw at 65 400
so we knew that this could be where the level push pushes back up
and this is also where we can see the market reverse back down, going down to the weekly chart to the daily chart, because that's where we were
and i'm gonna do replay so we don't have to do that all the time
okay? so we saw the market creating high highs and high lows, and eventually the market pulls back up to the demand zone, the previous alltime high
and what does the market do? the market, slowly, steady, starts to consolidate exactly in between these levels
but the market can still create a higher low, right? a bigger pullback
so what we're gonna do in this case, based on this, on the trend line, is that we're gonna use a fib from the last high low, in this case, at fifty six thousand and 50, to the high at, uh, 66 033
and the market came back down and and retested the fibonacci levels
and we also came back up and retested um all el were take profit
one got hit at six to eight thousand one hundred and seventy two um
but then we also need to remember that, okay, we're breaking the the supply zone the week, the monthly supply high, and that is at 65 420
so this is where, and then you start to see the market having bigger, a bigger pullback
we could still use the fifteen sixty one percent, in this case, between sixty one thousand and ninety two and fifty nine thousand eight hundred and eighteen, just to see, because previous, previous um fibonacci levels is really important to use um
so first of all, we had this higher low, but then you see the market, slowly, steady, give us other higher low
so we need to adjust the trend line to to the higher lows, right from this, connect it with these ones
and then you start to see that the market is giving you some a heavily bearish candlesticks, right? and then we also, let's see, we can use this previous high, too
remember that we have in our mind that, okay, we are right now on the monthly supply zone
and what does the market do? the market breaks the support trend line
and this one too, because now we can see the market is dropping, right? because we did break the support trend line on the higher time frames
now what we're gonna do is that would drag another fibonacci from the last higher low to the higher high
because this is where we when we see that the market is pulling back down now, this is where we start to think, ah, okay, this is where potentially the market can pull back down now to create a potential higher low and then see the market pull back up
because, as you can see, when it comes to the higher time frames pullbacks, it's so much bigger than the small ones that we see on the lower time frames, obviously
and that's why you can be a little bit confused sometimes when the market is giving you a bigger pullback
it looks like bitcoin, everyone is looking for bitcoin to go up, right? but just because we could potentially have some bullish momentum, like big bullish momentum, that can only be a pullback on the higher time frames
the market needs to create a pullback on the higher time frames, which means that you will have a bigger move, but the market will come to a place where it needs to create the lower high, and then you will see the next drop
and this is usually where people mistake a pullback with a reverse of the trend, which is not so in this case, when we break the support trendline, we don't know that this will happen, right? happy lucky
if you want to see the other tas, you can go back in the live stream
we did have the ta in the beginning, so now we have the back testing session
market comes below the previous higher low, creates the lower high
and when we break below these levels, the targets that will look for the market to pull back down to is the higher time frames, fibonacci, where the higher low can be created
and that is between, in this we waited for the market to pull back down to 54, 440 and 51 910
but what happened when we're, when we're reaching these levels? and this is where we connect the other trend line with the downtrend
so we're going to take this one away because it's not valid anymore
i think it was a weekly remember when we connected these, this trend line with this low, with this higher low
if we would follow market structure and the trend line, the trend line was so perfectly, perfectly combined with the fibonacci
and this was where we expected the market to create the higher low, because that is following market structure
does not look like the market will come back down in reverse, because with the help of this trend line, we know that, okay, we can come back down to these levels, potentially see the market consolidate
but until we break the trend line, as you read test, combined with the higher low, sorry, with the fibonacci
on the higher time frames where the higher low is expected, combined with the trend line
we could because we read, we read um candlesticks also, because the candlestick is showing us the way
so just because i have a a fibonacci level, a support level, a trend line, that that doesn't matter when you start to see the market is heavily pushing down
so for me to just go into, oh, yeah, but we are in the higher time frames, fibonacci levels, i i think the market will continue up
well, what you think in the market gives you two different things
your job is not to say what the market should do because you wanted to do that because you want to have a lot of money and invest in bitcoin
that is completely wrong and just so naive, because the market is screaming, this will not be respected
you saw this huge break also, of the weekly support trendline
so and also you could see how how huge of a candlestick that we do have
so for the for the market to break up, just, you know, break that, you need so much power
and remember, the trend now, we saw the the break of the support trend line
we also saw one retest on the lower uh on the daily market, then pulls back up
we didn't respect the higher low where the higher low was supposed to be created, right? so the the the structure on the higher time frames is broken
i took the fibonacci from 57 224 back down to, i think i also use this a level right here, or this support uh between, okay, for the six thousand nine and ninety four
remember now that we are still below the support trend line at the we're still below the uh 15 61 of the higher time frames
we're using a fibonacci now to potentially see if the market creates a lower high
so i i hope that this was good for you to because it's really hard, just using trend lines, just using fibonacci
i'm gonna, i'm gonna make sure that you can write in the chat now, um, because we need some break to to just study, study, study
will definitely tire your brains, and i don't want you to, i don't want that to happen
do you like the way i explained? did you learn something new? um, because this is, this is how i see the market
this the way i show it to you is very easy for me, because i can see the patterns
i do live streams every single week day, almost every single day, daily updates about cryptocurrencies and back testing
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that and put the notification because i have daily updates every single day, and you don't want to miss that, even though i'm no financial advisor
tomorrow i will have a morning live stream in exactly nine hours
so from nine hours from here, i will have a morning live stream
we will go through the charts and see what could potentially happen during the day
uh, i don't know exactly, but tomorrow, a lot of i think the market will be very slow tomorrow
guys, if we reach 200 likes in this live stream, youtube will send me a new microphone
so guys, we have 152 likes right here on this youtube live stream
and if we have 200 likes, youtube will send me a new microphone, which is so good
sebzep, do you contact them? i'm a master in space and time travel
yeah, you do the, you do the uh, uh, what is it called? out of out of body and outofbody experiences
what lifestyle do you want? and then slowly and steady, you will get there
everything takes time, but with the right focus, you will get there so much faster than you think
guys, how many likes to 200? i will not say that, because the last time i was like, one, two, three, four
and if you are new to trading, uh, crypto trading for beginners on my youtube channel
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
but by bit is really good when it comes to holding your position for a longer time with the very low fees
and the good thing when it comes to the good things, when it comes to buy bit, is that when you put your trades, you can also see exactly how much you are willing to lose, how much you are willing to oh, we have, we have a scammer in here, naked
this is, this is when we use our brains for good things, not some low vibrations, stupid things
okay, but we can go into bitcoin now and just say, do a little recap till tomorrow to what can happen tomorrow
i checking his website to find more evidence, of course you will
okay, so let's see, we can do a recap on what i think could potentially happen
no, it looks like we close with a inverted hammer against a previous support
so if we're looking at the weekly we do have the inverted hammer
and it looks like we kind of need the market to pull back up also
but going to the lower time frames, what we're also going to do, i'm just going to do the setups quickly so i can give it to you
okay, so we're using the daily trend line now, remember, because we went to, we were going through, we were going through the, uh, the trend lines before
we can never use this lower high, because if that's the case, we will break these ones, and the market will never respect this price the trend line will give us
and that is kind of pretty perfectly connected with if we need to fill this week, right? so if a a push back up to potentially 32 164 and 33 and 100, this could be where we see the market pull back up to, for then reverse back down
but if you also go to the 12 hourly chart, we also have a demand supply zone right here
so we just might only, if we now see the market push back up, we just might only see the market pull back up to potentially 31 612 and, uh, 31 940
you only see the market pull back inside of it, maybe half of the box, and then you see the drop
but we also have another trend line on the lower time frames, on the four hourly charts, the we did break it
and let's see, if we go to the two daily terms, we also have this demand zone from this candlestick
so go down to the lower time frames, we do have a pretty, uh, strong candlestick right here on the four hourly
i would use this one in case we see the market, um, only try to fake us out
the market is is, and this is the thing, the market is really ugly when the market is just pushing too
you will see the market either have some like a huge break to the upside or a huge break to the downside, because the market has been consolidating so long
so we're just, what i wait for is to be honest, only the pullback
where is the pullback? where will it be? will it be a bigger pullback, or a lower pullback? and the last low on bitcoin now is 29 457
so if you break below it, this could be only another lower high
we can create another lower low, come back up and create a lower high against the previous lower low, and that could be the continuation down
so you know what? i seriously just want to wait till tomorrow and see how everything, how everything looks
so we we i am always very careful when it comes to mondays to see what's actually happening
guys, i'm gonna start to end this live stream right now, because we're gonna see each other in a couple of hours
as i told you, if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that

we see each other in a couple of hours with some smile on our faces and a coffee in our hands
thank you everyone for taking your time to welcome back to the good to watch everyone
my name is josh, and right now, ethereum is flashing a new signal that we haven't seen since 2019, entering into early 2020
and this is happening at the same time as bitcoin attempting to break that massive streak of red nine weeks in a row
and the next weekly kindle close is coming up very soon, and i'll be talking more about that in just a moment
and obviously, as you can see here, over the past nine weeks in a row, we've seen constant red in terms of the weekly candles
previously, bitcoin has never seen nine weeks of red in a row until recently
but the next weekly candle closed at the time of recording this video, is in around seven hours from now
and at the moment, it's currently sitting in the green, which means we could potentially end this massive streak of red
and to help assist this weekly candle in staying as a green weekly candle, we do have this bullish divergence here on the twoday bitcoin chart, as i have been discussing for a while now on the channel
but in case you're new to the channel, a bullish divergence just means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, which is pretty much exactly what we've seen ever since we formed these bullish divergence a few weeks ago
and something else to keep an eye on is the bollinger bands indicator on the daily bitcoin charts, because right now we're still experiencing a massive squeeze in this indicator, which reveals another massive move is coming sometime soon for bitcoin
you can think of a squeeze in the bollinger bands indicator as kind of like a spring that is coiling up, getting ready to spring out
but in this case, we have the bitcoin price that is coiling up, getting ready for another massive move, like what we saw back here, for example
around the end of april, entering into early may, we experienced a massive squeeze in this bollinger bands indicator, which showed us that another massive move was coming very soon
and in terms of how soon we could see that volatile move, that obviously depends on what time frame you're looking at
and here on the daily charts, it usually takes around one to two weeks before we finally experience the volatile move from when we started squeezing in the bollinger bands
but in some more rare examples, we can squeeze up towards even around one month before then we experienced a massive volatile move
and then we entered another squeeze in the bollinger bands, where we saw roughly around two weeks worth of squeeze and then another volatile move
and now giving you a quick update on the four hour bitcoin chart, taking a look at the shorter term price action
at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is still finding shortterm support along this golden pocket sitting at around 29 and a half thousand
and like i've been saying in recent videos here on the channel, if we do see a confirmed break back below 29 and a half thousand, then we could head back down towards around 28 and a half thousand, where our next massive level of support is sitting at
but otherwise, if bitcoin continues these shorts and balance, our next level of resistance to pay attention to is coming into play at around thirty thousand seven hundred dollars per bitcoin
but in the meantime, while the bitcoin price is in between support and resistance, obviously we're looking more neutral above anything else, like what we're looking like a couple weeks ago
and now getting into the ethereum part of this video, starting off on the six hour ethereum to us dollar chart
technically speaking, we still possibly have this descending triangle pattern in its formation phase, unless we see the price of ethereum bounce back up towards this line of resistance without retesting this 1700 low
because in that case, as of right now, we have clearly formed a higher low at the time of recording this video
and in that scenario where we might form something like that, then obviously we need to readjust this line of support, and it would no longer be a descending triangle pattern, and instead more of a symmetrical triangle pattern or a horizontal triangle pattern
but as of right now, seventeen hundred dollars per ethereum is one of our most important levels of support at the moment
and whether or not we do retest that support either way, this line of resistance is still definitely an active line of resistance, considering these multiple tests
and that is currently coming into play at around 1930 to 1940 per ethereum
and just zooming out to take a quick look at the daily ethereum charts, specifically these bullish divergence that i've been talking about over the past few days
and once again, as i've mentioned over the past couple days, we're looking very similar at the moment to what we're looking like entering into the middle of march
because looking back at february, in march, that polish divergence expanded over around two weeks or so
and the moments that bullish divergence confirmed, we saw a shortterm bounce and then a pullback, almost back down towards that second low
but we still ended up forming a slightly higher low, and instead it forms something like a w pattern, which is very similar to what we're seeing at the moment
but this w pattern has not been confirmed as of right now, because we'll need to break a buff this high just here, coming into play at just above two thousand dollars per ethereum
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum short positions on the bifinix exchange here on the daily timeframe
and in fact, if i zoom all the way out to the weekly ethereum chart, looking at the ethereum price action on the weekly time frame once again, and looking at the ethereum short positions on the bifinix exchange on that same weekly time frame, you can see that right now, after the ethereum whales on this exchange have closed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ethereum short positions, these short positions are lower than what we saw in the middle of last year
and in fact, they're sitting at their lowest value we've seen since the end of 2019, entering into early 2020
and if i just place a horizontal line where they're sitting at right now, you can clearly see that the only other time throughout ethereum's history, and the history of this exchange in particular, where these ethereum short positions were lower than where we're sitting at right now, that was after we already experienced a lot of bearish price action
so essentially, we saw a lot of traders on this exchange take profits from their short positions as they potentially saw risk of more upside price action similar to what we're seeing right now, but on a much larger scale in terms of the dropoff
and what is really interesting is, just after we saw this happen at the end of 2019, we saw a massive pump in the price of ethereum by around 150 to the upside
and now i want to make it clear that i'm not saying we're just about to see another 150 pump
but what i am saying is these traders on this exchange, which historically speaking, have been very accurate, have already taken a lot of profits on their short positions
just in the last few weeks, they've closed hundreds of millions of dollars of shorts
and this potentially also means these traders trading with hundreds of millions of dollars, see risk of more upside price action, which is why they could be closing so many ethereum short positions at the moment to the lowest levels we've seen since the end of 2019, entering into early 2020, once again
and now taking a look at the ethereum versus bitcoin charts on the daily time frame, and over the past one day, we have now confirmed this bullish divergence
because, as you can see here, we've clearly seen lower lows in the ethereum versus bitcoin price action in terms of the daily kettle closes, and we've seen higher lows in the daily rsi, which means we could be due to see reduced bearish momentum, at least in the shorter term, for ethereum versus bitcoin
which means ethereum, potentially over the next few days, maybe even over the next couple weeks, could hold its weight against bitcoin and possibly slightly outperform bitcoin in the shorter term
but i do not expect a massive pump in the price of ethereum against bitcoin, because even though we have these bullish diversions active on the chart right now, we are still in a strong bearish trend for ethereum versus bitcoin
and definitely make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
how is everyone doing? let me know if you can hear me, if you can see me right away in the comment section, because i've been having some technical issues
okay, zooming in to see if we can find some scalping day trade opportunities
of course, i do see the btc price potentially continuing to the downside
the reason why we did get this major kind of double bottom, okay? we have
is it going to manage to come all the way back up here to the 30 600 range, where we've got heavily rejected? now, the reason why we got heavily rejected from this range, we know that this was a major, important level, okay? that we could have that corrective move from this point
mentioned yesterday, i was waiting for a little bit of more volatility, a little bit of more few attempts
but also, we did mention on the live stream that if we did break, okay, this kind of last lower high region, that it was very, very likely going to have that continuation to the downside
we know that this has been the value area high from the volume traded the last 25 days
before actually getting major rejection from the 32 000 range here, we saw this kind of diamond pattern, multiple attempts, very successful, short from this range
because we were also talking about this scenario over here, this major fractal from december of 2021, playing out beautifully
and if we take a look at the vpvr, but not on the side here, looking at the svp, all right, the vpvr on each day, you can clearly see there was this big, major consolidation
you can see the point of control right at this level, also getting rejected from this range
so also one of the main reasons we did get this bounce from this level, okay? just looking at vpvr, looking at fib levels, we had the biggest point of control being at this region right now, it is at the twenty nine thousand seven hundred dollars, round about where we're trading now because of this consolidation
but just a few days ago, it was right over here, right at this range, just at the 29 300, where we did get that bounce
and also taking a look at fib levels from this lowest point, okay, from this big, massive pump, we were hitting the 618, the 065, okay, fibonacci range right over here, and getting those bounces from this level
now, your question might be, are we going to go to lower levels, or are we going to go to higher levels? and this is something that we're going to discuss in today's episode, in today's livestream
sorry, um, i do think that it is highly probable that we actually going to roll back down, that this is not going to be a double bottom
i think we're going to roll down from this level to retest the 28 600 area
this is our next big, major support level here, value area, low
so i think, you know, with this massive, big pressure, i think continuation to the downside, there is a slightly more probability in this happening
because we're also taking a look at this fractal from december 20 20, uh, 2021
okay, big consolidation right over here, pumps and dumps right there, just after getting this big, major rejection
so everything points out that, you know, we can might be boring, and i think consolidation and a little bit of slight continuation to the downside is is very, very likely
now, is this a trading range? is there a trading opportunity at this level? well, in my opinion, no, if you, if i'm personally already in some trades, if you didn't actually short this level and take profits at these lows and protect your position, then, of course, yeah, shorting here is a little bit risky
all right? because we can actually do a double bottom and come all the way up here and come down here, i think there is slightly more possibility and getting a little bit of volatility and consolidation and continuing back down to retest the 28 600
now, i'm gonna ask a question here in the poll before i go through the comment section
we did see yesterday, getting a little bit of a pump, as you can see, creating a slightly higher low over here
is it going to manage to break and continue back up? and this is going to be very, very bearish for bitcoin
we can analyze the situation here, but i want to we can take a look at the bitcoin dominance also
it's kind of forming an ascending wedge, okay? it's kind of getting exhausted, as you can see here on the chart
and it looks like that, if we do see that correction on the bitcoin dominance in the next coming days, this is going to be very good, because a lot of the altcoins are kind of creating a double bottom
if bitcoin does behave a little bit, okay, a little bit of sideways action, and the bitcoin dominance does have a correction in the coming days, this means that the all coins could get a big, big bounce
so we have to analyze on the bitcoin dominance, you know, from what major support levels do we need to break? okay, to actually confirm that, it might be really good for the altcoins, for a relief rally, where we could take some opportunities also trading
guys, we got 55 likes, and we've got almost 250 people watching at this moment
i need you to smash up the like button all together at this moment
and i want to ask, what comes first? what comes first? guys, if you take a look at the btc price? all right, let's just zoom out here on the two hourly
and what i'm going to ask you, right? we are at the 30 000 range
what comes first? do we actually pump and come to 35 000? or do we dump and come to 25 000 range? what comes first? 25k or um, 35k? and i'm gonna ask, does um, 25k bitcoin first, hang on one second
does 25k bitcoin come first, first, then 35k? let me know, guys in the comment section
and i'm gonna go straight through the comment section right away
i've got the com uh, i've got the comment section here lagging a little bit, right? i'm going to go through the comment section, say hello
i did actually add to my position as soon as we started falling from this support line that we did talk about yesterday
yesterday we were talking about this scenario over here on bitcoin, all right, this kind of ascending channel
i did get someone in the community in the comment section saying, you know, is this a bear flag? and it did look very much like a bear flock, right where we were hitting this major resistance we're saying, right are we either consolidate at this level, or if we start losing, you know, the last lower high of higher low, sorry, over here, then it's going to be looking very, very bearish
i started adding to my short position over here to enter um, to have a a price entry around about the 3 800, and i'm still in that position
i've been actually taking profits at this low over here after this consolidation
um, as you can see here on by bit guys, i did have a position here, remember, round about the 31 800, taking a lot of profit after we started
and falling back down, i added to my position, got an average entry all the way here to round about the seven 30 dollar range, taking profits all the way down here
um, so let's just go through the comment section and let's take a look at some altcoins
i'm just going to go quickly through the comment section, get bnb ready and see what's going on with bmb, let's zoom out on the three daily chart
they're all making fun of me, these moderators, because of my spanish wifi
um, i think a lot of people, i got nepalese saying that 25k is coming first
esko, hey, andy, can you do bnb? yeah, i'm going to take a look at bnb right away
i've got a bunch of stable coins that i do not know what to do with them
kevin, i actually, you know, went through twitter, okay, and i'm gonna do bmb right now
i went through twitter, and, you know, a lot of people, you know, saying that their dollar cost averaging
and in the comment section of, you know, these people saying that they're, you know, dollar cost averaging, uh, is is ideal right now? at these price levels, so many people, so many people are saying, i am waiting for lower
and you know, this what usually happens with all those people that do not dollar cost average and wait for lower
but dollar cost average at this range is, in my personal opinion, the best strategy if you want to accumulate bitcoin
i mean, this is the thing, look, how many people want to buy bitcoin at 15 000? so this the thing is, it might and never ever happen
uh, andy, what's your opinion on the bearish price target of 21k ish, which is also at 200 ma weekly? i think it is very, very possible
i think it's possible that bitcoin could actually, you know, um, slightly drop below 25 000, 24, 23, 22, but not successfully breaking down 20, 20k
i don't see bitcoin trading much, uh, you know, much time before 20k
i don't even think it's gonna ever trade below twenty thousand dollars
and it could, probably, it could lead the price of bitcoin going down, uh, below 20 000
bnb, first, bnb, and i'll go through the super chat right away
and i think i'm just gonna change the chart, because this has been, you know, just old analysis here
let's take a look at bnb and take a look at the major zone levels
why is it solid level? because we had a reaccumulation here back in march, okay, february, march of 2021, reaccumulation, as you can see
remember in the summer of 2021, when we did have that big, massive drop in may on bnb, bnb went from almost 700 all the way down to 216 dollars, even wicking down that range
now, of course, this major consolidation that we did have managed to hold as support
so we are basically, you know, trying to look for nice accumulation zones
all right, the 200 range, i think a potential retest is very, very likely
i do think bnb will retest several times 200, or even below 200, creating kind of a descending, um, descending wedge, something like this consolidation
um, remember, i remember being, uh, seeing a lot of people very, very bearish
and of course, of course, this kind of price action makes people even more bearish, right? where you do drop and retest the lows, you have a kind of a fake breakout, then people get extremely, extremely bearish, more bearish
then you have another slightly fake out over here, more bearish
and then you kind of form a descending wedge scenario until you actually break the resistance of the descending wedge
so, in my personal opinion, retesting down to the 200 on on bmb
from the start of the drop, from april here, i would get fibonacci levels
the big, major drop here on bmb started here at the 460 dollars on the 6th of april
as you can see, did have a big, massive, dead cap bounce all the way up to the 50 percent fibonacci retracement, getting that rejection here to perfection
we do have also a major, major level, uh, right over here, as you can see, big, big, major zone that we did actually get a couple of bounces as support
this was in january and in february, bouncing from the 330 range, we dropped here aggressively pumped to the 50 fibonacci from the drop and hitting that major support turning into resistance, enough confluence for me to actually, you know, take that short position
so zooming in here right now, what could potentially happen? i think we are very, very likely going to form a kind of descending, kind of a descending triangle right there on, uh, bnb let me zoom in here on the one hourly
uh, the possibilities in having an abc correction here are very, very high
if we do break the resistance from these lower highs, all right, in the next coming days, then this is gonna, very likely gonna have a leg up to the six one eight
and we also, you know what the reason why is? because we're looking for that a, b, c correction and then continuation to the downside
um, we are just going to have relief pumps in in crypto, in my personal opinion
uh, when we have this aggressive fall and this kind of aggressive bear market, crypto doesn't have a vshape recovery
it's going to take quite some time, all right, to to have a a big recovery
i think it's just going to consolidate and go slightly to the downside in sideways
if bnb does manage to go to the 618, 363 dollars in the coming days, you know, if we do break this resistance, you could arguably discuss that we are going to have that leg up to this level
that is going to be a major, major level of rejection for potential continuation to the downside
let me just take a look at vpvr levels if we have any major spikes
if i just zoom out here, on the four hourly, the trading range in between, you know, january of 2022 till today
inside of these six months of trading, we have, you know, a big, massive consolidation in between 330 and 450, making this big, massive volume profile wall here
so the value area low is very, very likely going to be huge resistance
where is this value area low? this value area low is exactly at the 618, the 360 dollars
so if bnb does have that abc correction here, all the way up to the 618, it's an ideal short
and in my opinion, this would be an ideal short if we go up there, 360, huge level, 618 from the massive drop
and if you, you know, there's a really nice day trade, small swing trade here, trading the 363 dollars all the way down at least to the 330
you know, the likelihood of us coming back down to retest these lows after hitting the 618, 360 on bmv, it's just, it's, um, a high probable trade
this is a high probability trade where you can make some gains
i'll tell you what, i will be putting an alarm on this right away
at this level, slightly below 360, i will be putting an alert here on bmb
check out the charts, check out these levels, and see if there's going to be a nice shorting opportunity
of course, if we start breaking here, the 290 lows, it's very, very likely that we'll be heading all the way down to at least the 618
so i'll be looking for the 250, approximately, if we do break this low, having that leg, uh, leg down, very, very likely to happen
anyway, let's take a look at the superchat here that i do have
i've been a little bit too long, but bnb it's worth the analysis
it's a very solid, of, of course, cryptocurrency from binance
and it, it has a lot of liquidity, and, you know, the pro you can make some gains
so it's definitely worth to take five, ten minutes looking at the, you know, potential opportunity areas on bmb
i really like this one here at the 200 and at the 360 dollars
i'm not sure if we're going to reach there, but if we do, i do think that we're going to get heavily rejected from this value area, low and the 618, from this major drop, abc correction to continue back down
what's um going on with ethernet chain? right? uh, i would like a little bit of more price data
wow, this one had a, it's um, i mean, this is, this is the thing about this one, this one actually got into, um, the the set, you know, the hype in 2021
you know, just after july, you know, we got july bitcoin trading at 30 000 range, and then going to alltime highs again in november
and ethernet had that hype in that moment, all right, in between august and november
so this is very, this is one of those cryptos, in my opinion, that is just going to have a large, large, boring consolidation
and it's just going to take a long, long time, a long, long time
sideways action, some relief, rallies, some dumps here below this range
but i would say that this is very, very close to the bottom area
and i don't know, i have no idea this is going to go sideways for a long, long time
all right, taking a look at ada, um, you know, for the last few years, where we did have this huge market cycle, and it just went boring for, for for a couple of years, it just went boring
so in my personal opinion, you know, ethernet chain is, we are these potential levels right where we are going to see relief pumps, but it's just going to take many, many months just to have a large reaccumulation, a massive accumulation zone, for one, two years
if you do take a look at these two charts, okay? you can see these kind of two spikes, you know, this is a kind of a classic market cycle, okay? where you do have big, massive spikes here, as you can see, creating the lower high
you got a big, massive one, and then you got the second one, creating the lower height
and then, you know, you actually just boring price action, the confidence to be built on, on, on, uh, the crypto investment
okay, people to investing crypto is going to take a long, long time
in my personal opinion, i think we are around about these levels where we are going to go sideways, uh, you know, some relief pumps, back down again, retesting the lows
and all of this sideways action, for some of those good projects, is going to be the best buying opportunity, because at some point in the next coming years, you are going to see a big, massive hype again, a big, massive hype
if we're gonna take a look at the projection in the coming months, it's just gonna go, just gonna be trading inside of this this major, big box, uh, that i've just drawn here
the sentiment in crypto right now is, is dead, basically, so um
if we take a look at the four hourly, this basically has has just performed this dead cat balance scenario
there's not much to analyze on these volatile, small cryptocurrencies
it's just very likely to retest the lows, potentially, and go sideways for a long time with some relief rallies
i don't usually do analysis on these major cryptos that have these kind of big, massive wicks
nepalese, thank you very much for the um, for the super chat, my man
i mean, i've got 230 votes and, uh, in the poll here, does 25k come first, then 35k? and 64 of people say yes, there is slightly more people there are bearish
we're having a little bit of pumpy action right now on bitcoin
i want to take a look at some cryptos for the community we were talking about yesterday
so must have been taking a look at solana yesterday, where we were we were looking for that retest of the 35 000 um, and for that potential bounce
i mean, solana is getting absolutely, absolutely crushed compared to some other ones that are still, you know, creating a higher low at this region
so what could happen to solana is that we could potentially relief rally if bitcoin does behave
and taking a look at some altcoins such as ethereum, solana that have retested the lows over here, you know, there is something that is telling me that the possibilities in bitcoin actually recovering from this level is very, very possible
i mean, i'm going with the charts, and i'm following this fractal
of course, this fractal takes the bitcoin price to much, much lower levels
but, um, i do think that a potential retest of the six 25 dollar range is is very, very possible
we would have to break out for me to start becoming confident
to go to 35k, we would have to come back up after this rejection, come back up here the 30 600 range
if the bitcoin price starts getting above this level with high volume, this is going to be looking pretty good
i do see this, you know, potentially having another leg up to the upside, creating this dual bottom
and very likely we'll be retesting this level and and actually breaking it
um, so, yeah, if it all depends really on bitcoin, but solana is looking, it's looking very, very weak
i think, you know, maybe a little bit of volatility and a bounce, and then another retest of these lows, and then break down
i mean, this is a bearish pattern where you do have the selling pressure, of course, with the lower highs, and you do have a base at 35
could you break it in the next coming days? yeah, it's very, very possible
if bitcoin does drop, you know, and retest the 25k, 26k levels in the next coming days, it's going to be absolutely crazy for some altcoins
no doubt in my mind that, you know, celina will lose this, this, um, this level, this 35k level
this is where i expect a huge bounce on solana, twenty dollar range
massive, big pumps here in april, uh, all the way till may, till we had that major drop, of course
then in july, august, solano's when it went absolutely insane, all the way almost to the 280 but yeah, this this summer low area on solana
if it does come down there, if we break 35 dollars, the probabilities in solana coming down there is is very, very high
as you can see, it was a spike created on the 6th of july, 6 8 of july
and you can see the price action in between 20 and 35 was very, very fast
so if we lose 35 dollars, we basically haven't got much support below us
all the way down to 20, we could get that volatility, but it's very, very likely to push down to those levels if we do see bitcoin coming back down to retest the 25k range
if we do have a solid, four hourly candle with high volume, breaking down this low over here, with high volume right there, we do get a spike in volume, breaking the zone, get ready, because much lower levels will be very, very likely on solana
watch out for fake outs, of course, because if we start making this kind of price action and multiple attempts, i would actually be long in here, uh, on solana
if we do have multiple failed attempts, waiting patiently if we but if we do have a big, solid candle like this, boom, right there with high volume, yeah, you can expect that this, this rich, small consolidation or retracement will have continuation to the downside
solid breakout to confirm, with high volume if you have volatility here, few spikes, dipping below here on the one hourly, the four hourly, and actually staying at this range after a few days, it will be a time for a potential long opportunity, at least to the forty dollars, where i do have the next major resistance zone
wait patiently to see what kind of consolidation happens in the next coming days
this does look like it's gonna enter a big, massive accumulation zone for the next coming months
we had a kind of an ascending triangle fake out back inside of the of the ascending triangle
um, there's not too much market capitalization on this one, 96 million
um, [Music], we are basically trading at a large consolidation area from 2021
so we do, this is a reason why we do have this spike on the vpvr
so this could be a consolidation area where where it's just going to go sideways for a long day a long time
it might just consolidate, but it's just going to be very, very boring, guys
when i see this, when i see this on on the altcoins, you know, massive, big hype, massive, big drop, dead cat bounce right over here
and and this is just gonna, it's gonna take a long time, guys
it's gonna enter an accumulation zone for many, many, many months
um, [Music], immediate, short term on this one, immediate short term
i think long term, like i said, it's going to be a lot large consolidation
it's going to be very, very boring for a lot many, many months
short term, here, looking at the full hourly chart, we are creating aggressive lower highs, as you can see, getting very respected lower highs with this trend line
a reason why is because i'm not sure where you can actually trade this pyr um
this was an insane shorting opportunity, at least, you know, why would i ever have shorted this level over here, this pump, because of the big spike on the vpvr from this volume traded zone we're having the lower high resistance trend line
so you got two confluence, big spike on the vpvr resistance trend line
and you know, just to add more confluence from these drops over here, fibonacci, from this high to the low, you're hitting the 618 65 to perfection right there
that is a when you add up so much confluence, it's just, um, it's a must it's a must short position, right there
it's enough to to take that risk, short position, uh, risk some money and and get into a trade
and of course, i would, you know, you i would be aiming for the six one eight from this pump
and protecting my position, just in case you actually retest and break the lows in the coming days
so, [Music], what else? what else? what else? right? to keep it simple here, just to have something prepared here on pyr
i'm not sure if you wanted to know the short term analysis, or or the long term, what could happen
long term, i think it's going to be boring, many, many months of a potential accumulation zone, if this is a good project
so this is a level that needs to be, you know, considered here on pyr, right? which is, which is exactly at the 380
we've got the lower highs at this zone, right? so what we want to see if we do break this resistance trendline, we want to see a breakout above this level
a lot of people saying, um, you know, many, many youtubers and other analysts saying, you know, they, they draw a pattern, and and, and that's it, right? where you do have this kind of price action, you know, symmetrical triangle
and i do explain this a lot of the times, you know, stay cautious with fake outs
you want to break big, big levels, not only just the trend line
you need to add confluence to your trade, to your movements on the market
not just because you have a textbook pattern and you break it, you know, in an inverse head and shoulder, and you do have, you know, you break the neckline, are you going to be bullish then? no, you need to add confluence
you need to see major levels, vpvr, volume, fibonacci, um, you know, levels also
so if we do break the trend line, basically, i'm not going to be bullish
looking for opportunities would be when we break here, this point of control at the 470 range and this last lower high, you know, it's some, this is the big, major level where i would be looking for training opportunities once we break that level, this is very likely to be very strong support
of course, what would be a rejection range? well, i would be looking at this level over here
okay, so just to take a look at trading opportunities guys, because, of course, on the live streams, i do want to explain, you know, where would be the trading opportunities, of course
so we can see fibonacci levels with volatility the five dollar 520, approximately, which would be around about this zone you could get that volatility
so if you do break this level, you've got this level over here at the 460, you've got this level here at the 42430
so these, these are levels where you'll be very likely going to get some kind of reaction and some potential training opportunities
if you do, you see the price action breaking this last lower high, 470, you know, you have an insane trading range inside of this level, um which you could, should be taking opportunities
they do support, you know, over, they do support over, over 50 cryptos
you got an insane bonus down below, okay, to claim up to four thousand and fifty dollars
you do not pay any maker fee for 30 days if you sign up with my link and you got the insane bonus
i use buybit for swing trading, and i use primex bt for day trading and swing trading other assets such as s p 500
why would i short natural gas? with the current world situation, natural gas is going to skyrocket
because, you know, i do see, i do see, um, a distribution, a wyckoff distribution on natural gas
okay? if people are not aware of the wychov distribution that did happen in bitcoin back in, you know, april, may of 2021
that was the moment that i did take 20 of my profits of, uh, from my portfolio from, um, all of the crypto that i did by back up, uh, back did buy in 2019, 2020, right? but i only took 20 profits of my portfolio right at this level over here, right over here, because this made a massive distribution event right over here
as you can see, this was in, you know, february, march, april of 2021
this is, you know, smart money is leaving the market, okay? smart money is leaving the market at these peaks
and after losing this low over here, this is when i started to panic a little bit, saying, wow, i'm gonna, i'm actually gonna, you know, take some profits from all of those bitter crypto that i've been accumulating back from mid 2018, 2019, 2020, only 20 of profits
i actually rode chain link all the way up and all the way down
but projects such as v chain, bitcoin ethereum, i did take 20 of profits approximately at this level before the big, massive crash
of course, what you know, just a few weeks after, i was thinking to myself, why didn't i take 50 profits, or 60, or all of it, right? but this is the thing, you're never gonna, you know, you do have it
you do have doubts, but this is why you need to kind of percentage, you know, um, diversify your also, dollar cost, average in, dollar cost, average out, kind of thing as well
no, so anyway, just wanted to show you here this distribution event from from uh from summer of 2021, just before the summer of 2021, in february, march, april, where smart money is actually getting out, because these are not successful breakouts
and i do think that something very, very similar is happening to natural gas right now, where you are seeing, you know, these slightly higher highs
this is the thing, it's a very important commodity in in the world at this moment
but smart money buys down here, you know, february, march, when they see the tensions worldwide of what, uh, what is currently happening
you know, smart money gets in, you know, buys, uh, up or down at these levels, and then smart money, you know, distributes, uh, you know, at these peaks, ready for that potential correction
and why is it worth the risk? because my position here at this pump, okay, this last pump over here, you know, the stop loss is right over here
the risk to reward can be absolutely huge, because we could have a pretty aggressive correction in natural gas
another reason why is because in the summer, july, august, you know, all the way up to september, there is not, you know, that much demand on natural gas
but that's totally fine, because we've got a stop loss here to protect our capital bank
if this, if this happens on natural gas, then, yeah, it just didn't work out
let's scroll down here, through the comment section and check out here
can you please check out cartier chain? uh, will it fall below 001, uh, dollars, if bitcoin falls to 22k ish
let's take a look if we do have more price data here somewhere
of course, it's only at 15 cents, so why wouldn't it? why wouldn't it go drop, you know, half a percent more? it's very, very positive
i'm just trying to find if there's any more price, um, any more price data here on trading view
i mean absolutely, especially if the bitcoin dominance goes up
if we do start seeing the bitcoin dominance going up, i i do have a potential target in the coming months on the bitcoin dominance
i do think bitcoin dominance, in this bearish market, this boring, sideways price action that we are potentially going to see in the next coming months is going to take the bitcoin dominance all the way back up here to around about the 54 55 levels
this will be the moment it will be very good to enter some all coins, of course, the good projects
and if bitcoin dominance does continue to the upside, and bitcoin price does actually retest 25k levels, and that slightly dips below that range, of course, above 20 000, there will be a lot of altcoins that will be retesting much lower levels, such as cardio chain, going down to one cent
no, doubt in my mind that this could happen if bitcoin goes down to 22k ish? yes, absolutely no doubt in my mind
and, you know, people will get excited in this relief rallies
you know, several months, several several months, big investors will trick you
they will push the price straight back down, because they want to accumulate
you know, while you're coming down, they will manipulate the price because they want to buy at cheaper, cheaper levels
and it's they want to buy for many, many months, you know, even one to two years
so these big, major relief rallies, i would be looking for shorting opportunities
you know, if if cardiac chain does come back up to this let range, then, yeah, i would be potentially looking for some shorting opportunities at the three cent level, 382 here
you start seeing some big, major spikes here of volume on the vpvr
because of this consolidation range, it's going to be a a rejection point here for potential continuation to the downside
so anyway, your your question is, if bitcoin does go down to 22k ish, will cardi chain go down to one cent level? and yeah, my answer is absolutely, absolutely, no doubt in my mind
we would just have to lose this low that we did create on the 12th of may
and then, yeah, but this would be a very good buying opportunity, in my opinion, if you strongly believe in this project
let's take a look at v jane, let's take a look, see what's going on with v chain
and, um, does 25k come first, then 35k? and, um, 65 of people say yes
so we got more people that are bearish still here, looking at the pool
let's take a look at, um, let's take a look at vechain, see what's going on
i bought v chain at point zero, uh, point zero, zero, 29, right at this level over here, in march of 2020
we're, you know, looking at percentage gains, right? um, let me go to the weekly chart
but let's take a look at, i mean, this is just such a classic chart of, you know, massive, big bubble burst, and it's just gonna enter a large, large, large consolidation in the next coming months, uh, months
but, yeah, this will be the, the, the, the opportunity of the lifetime for a lot of good projects
it's going to be very, very boring, but it is, you know, boring is exciting
i will tell you that i wasn't bored when i was buying bitcoin in in 2018, 2019 and 2020
let's um and i think, you know, a good accumulation zone for v chain, if you strongly believe in the project and you do think it will succeed, you know, in the next coming years
we did get a perfect bounce from the largest spike on the vpvr from the volume traded the last three, four years
i wish i could get this, um, uh, you can't really see it on the logarithmic
you know, just want to show you here, the largest mountain here of vpvr starts right there
if v chain goes down to two cent level, it's a very, very good buying zone
in my personal opinion, i don't see v chain successfully breaking much lower than two cents
it's gonna enter a large, large accumulation zone for many, many months
you know, round about this two cent zone, kind of a three cent, 15 cent
it's just gonna stay around this range for a long, long time, in my personal opinion, and it's gonna be a great, great levels to accumulate
um, and, yeah, this is the thing, i think vchain is, is looking very good to accumulate in the next coming months at those levels, in between 15 cent and and three cent range is zooming in here on v chain, right? zooming in here on v chain
on the four hourly chart, we have a big, massive trading zone
so we have a trading zone here on v chain where we do have the lows here at the 28 cents, and we have the highs here at the 34 cents
as you can see, as soon as you break out from this box, it is very, very likely to, you know, if you do have a successful breakup with volume, if you go to the downside, this is the thing, you know, this is the, this is the risky thing of dropping down from this box, where you're going to think that you are going to get rejected from this point and continue down
if we take a look at fib level here, from the lows to the highs on v chain
yeah, the six one eight, we've got a large consolidation here
this is how you trap traders where you think you're going to lose the low, and absolutely, you know, continue to the downside, and you might have a big, massive bounce at the 618, large consolidation, you know, create a higher low and continue to the upside
if you lose these lows, most of the traders are gonna, uh, retail traders gonna think that this is gonna continue down
i would stay cool, very cautious from this dead cat bounce, or depending on bitcoin, of course, if we do break above this range, i would be looking for shorting opportunities
where would i be looking for the longs? well, let's take a look right now
i'm taking a look at the longer time frame to look at accumulation zones
of course, my opinion, like i said, long term, okay, zooming out on the daily threeday chart
large accumulation for many, many months, in between six months and 18 months, for major opportunities
short time frame, okay, looking for the next coming days, coming weeks, you know, the the potential levels that we could get and big rejection
i'm just taking a look at fib level from this high on the four hourly chart on the 10th of may, till the lowest part of the drop, and looking at the 61865 fibonacci retracement
and it is, it's almost touching this, this low over here that we created on the 10th of may
so it's a major zone where i do think we could get heavily rejected
and this is the thing a lot of the traders might think, okay, we're breaking a zone
and there's a highly, highly, highly um resistance level in between the 35, that's right there, 35, 36 level
if you consolidate a little bit, this is very likely going to get a correction and maybe lose these highs
so stay cautious with this, because a lot of people just focus on the highs here
i would be eyeing this, if you start making this kind of movement, double top
you basically looking for that kind of a b, you know, c correction all the way up here, getting above slightly the a point
but luna 20, i guess, is it? luna 20? luna 20, not the classic luna, right? because classic luna, the classic luna, is dead, i think
it's just, has been a big, massive ponzi pyramid scheme, kind of crypto and, um, very fishy action from from the the, the scammer of the of the creator
i just needed, we need to say it, you know, um, what is the, what is the new luna? how could i find the new luna? let me just check here, because i i can only see the old terra luna
we got this one, which is it is trading at 647, but it's the same name
which one is it? tara? yeah, we cannot, yeah, there we have it
they have combined, they have combined luna 20 with the old classic luna on the chart
so what happened here is, of course, you had a, uh, some charts
they have put it together, and this, you you cannot do charting analysis, unfortunately, on on tara luna, to look at major levels, because it's had a transition from the crap luna to a crap 20 luna, by the looks of things
you know, this is like, like, you know, what happened to bernie madoff? he actually made a big, massive ponzi
what happened? he, you know, he was sentenced to jail for over 150 years
this guy, the tara luna guy, i'm not sure what his name is right now, he made a huge ponzi, 60 billion dollars disappeared
terror 20 launch big, massive pump on the exchange, you know, and then, you know, sideways action
i think people were not, you know, lost interest, uh, it's just gonna be very, very boring
request network, i remember, had a massive, big pump all the way to around about the one dollar range or so
let's take a look at request here, at another chart, because we did have, this was an absolute fail because i was looking for request network to hold the 25, but then, you know, the market sentiment in crypto just got absolutely crushed
i did buy request network at about two cents and sold at six cents, made a 3x and sold
like i said, on many of the old coins, it's just gonna enter a huge, massive, large consolidation
and it's just gonna enter a large, large, large consolidation till most of the people are just going to exit crypto
they're going to think it's dead, it's not going anywhere, and it's just very likely to to have this kind of price action
uh, also, where is the lows, you may ask, on on request network? well, i think this is a big, big level over here where we very likely not gonna dip below the five cent level
we currently just hit round about the nine cent level on a request network
the moment you start consolidating and going sideways like this is the moment you can dollar cost average very, very heavily
people that think that crypto is going to have a vshape recovery in the next coming months, i think is a little bit foolish, because markets don't work like this
and the moment people give up is the best moment you can, you can accumulate, because then, you know, you can make huge, huge gains, you know, at some point in the next coming years
you want to know my long term, you know, potential range? i think round about the five cent level being realistic
you know, i think request network can come as low as five cents easily
we're still coming down, as you can see on the chart, no signs of stopping anytime soon
at least you have a curve here, back here in in 2018, at least you're having a curve
as you can see, you you're still in an aggressive drop on request network
so if your take is, you know, what can happen to request in the next coming months? i think it needs to find a flaw
it needs to have a curve action, all right? and it might be around about the five cent level
as soon as you start going sideways for many, many weeks, you can have, you know, you can see that the price is potentially bottoming out at those levels for a potential accumulation
i think request network is a pretty good project um shortterm analysis
i mean, it's a little bit volatile, a lot of pump and dumpy action here, as you can see, very risky to trade, in my personal opinion
but we we got to remember we are in an aggressive downtrend, so you're still creating massive lower highs, as you can see
i do think that we are going to retest the lows here in the coming weeks
you know, a little bit of volatility here and and then continue back down
is is what i think is going to happen on request network the next coming days and weeks
you can trade this, but, yeah, stay cautious, because these have big, massive spikes to the upside or to the downside that will liquidate you if you use too much leverage in no time
if you're an experienced trader, you know the deal? you've got an insane bonus down below
will survive? and what is the future price prediction, please? oh, wow
and if it goes sideways for a long, long time, it's going to enter an accumulation zone
all right, room get ready for some boring, boring price action, guys
a lot of you people, i know, i did ask a poll in the comment section, in the comment section, um, and i was asking, did did you get into crypto in 2020, uh, 2021 and 2022? and i think it was, um, about 65 or even 70 percent of people said, yes
um, and the the moment, guys, you if you guys stick around, the next coming years, we will be finding a lot of projects that will be going down, but i'll be accumulating
i'll be sharing what i am buying for the next couple of years, and hopefully we'll be making huge, huge gains
so just for that, make sure to smash up the like button and subscribe to the channel
okay, for this, um, all this live stream, uh, but first of all, yeah, cardio chain has been checked already
i got jojo here, one of my mods, saying, you know, cardio chain, uh, cardio chain has been blessed
you know, my thoughts on bitcoin, i think, you know, it's gonna be boring, of course, in the weekly weekend, it is usually boring on the weekend
you know what i think could happen in the next coming hours and days? i think just it's gonna basically do some sideways action here
i would start becoming bullish if bitcoin does manage to break above thirty thousand five hundred dollars, five or thirty thousand six hundred dollars for that double bottom, in that continuation to the upside till then, yeah, relief rally here a little bit
we might be hitting the six, one eight from this, from this drop, and create a low high, and maybe have continuation to the downside
it is more more likely, the probabilities to come down, you know, to the 28 600 is high
you know, there's higher probabilities in coming down to this range
check out the bitcoin sensors website for the latest news and articles that we do post every single day
check out this article here in the bitcoin census website down below
my name is josh, and in just a moment, i will be explaining exactly why 23 000 per bitcoin is very important
and later in this video, i'll be giving you a quick update on ethereum, as always
and if you've been subscribed to this channel for a while now, watching these videos, you would already know about this chance right here
but in case you're new to the channel, i'll quickly explain what this means
basically, the white vertical lines represent the times where we saw a bearish cost in the monthly bitcoin macd
and it's important to mention we did see a couple false signals in terms of the bearish crosses here on the monthly bitcoin macd during late 2019 and 2020
but if you're looking at those crosses just there, this indicator on the monthly chart was just switching between bullish and bearish over and over again
so instead, if you're simply looking at the significant bearish crosses in this monthly bitcoin macd, which are basically the bearish crosses that have happened in these two previous significant bitcoin bear markets, which are, of course, 2014 and 2018
and once again, the white vertical line represents when we actually saw the bearish cross which is roughly around halfway through the bear markets
and then what we normally see is roughly around half a year later, more specifically, at around five months later, we end up seeing the bottom for the bitcoin bear market around five months after that initial bearish cost in the monthly bitcoin macd
and if you're looking at where we saw the most recent bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd, that was during the monthly candle of january, which means now that we're in june, we're five months away from where we saw that bearish cost in the monthly bitcoin macd
and according to bitcoin history, looking at these previous bitcoin bear markets, technically speaking, in terms of the time frame, it's usually around this month, give or take perhaps a month, that's we reach a bear market bottom and begin an accumulation phase that lasts for at least a few months, like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear markets
entering into early 2019, we saw a couple more months worth of sideways consolidation, before then we experienced a 300 pump in the bitcoin price
and looking at the end of the 2014 bear market, we experienced quite a few more months worth of sideways price action, relatively speaking, before we then entered the next significant bitcoin bull market
and obviously, when you consider what has happened in the past around this monthly bitcoin macd, what has happened in these previous bitcoin bear markets, technically speaking, it is possible for bitcoin to potentially form a lower low, which means potentially going a little bit lower than that 25k low, like what we've seen in these previous bitcoin bear markets
now i want to make it clear that obviously this is not a 100 guaranteed this is just simply going off previous bitcoin bear markets, going off the monthly bitcoin macd indicator
but if this were to play out, if we were to break below 25k, where would i be targeting personally? and well, to look at that, i'll be looking at the weekly bitcoin charts
and more specifically, i'll be looking at these moving averages, which are the 1000 days simple moving average and the 200 week simple moving average, which are coming in at just above 28 000 and just above 22 000, respectively
and on top of that, i'll be paying close attention to these fibonacci levels, specifically the 382 fibonacci level, and i'll explain exactly why that is the case
first of all, if you zoom all the way out on this weekly bitcoin charts, looking at bitcoin's entire price history, as i've said time and time again, the best and most profitable bitcoin buying opportunities throughout bitcoin's entire price history have occurred when the bitcoin price is in between the 1000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average
and ideally, the closer towards the 200 week the better, which is the red line, what's now bringing out the fibonacci retracement tool from swing low to swing high, going from that first significant bear market low back in 2011, when bitcoin crashed all the way down towards two dollars per coin, and up to the next bull market top at above 1200 per coin
if you're looking at the next bitcoin bear market bottom, at the end of the 2014 bear market, entering into 2015, the lowest point in the bitcoin price occurred basically in between the 236 fibonacci level and the 382 fibonacci level
is now getting rid of that and taking a look at the next massive bull bear cycle, going from the low in 2015, just before the next significance bull market, up towards the bull market top at the end of 2017 at around 20 000
and if you're looking at the next bear market bottom, which was obviously at the end of 2018, that was right at the 382 fibonacci level
and in fact, if i zoom in even closer to the chance so you can see exactly what happened at that time
we saw pretty much a perfect bounce from the exact 200 week moving average and the 382 fibonacci level, because they were coming in at very similar prices
and something else to point out that is interesting is the fact that we did find some short term support at around that 236 percent fibonacci level, just before we bottomed out at the 382 fibonacci level, closer towards that 200 week moving average
and now looking at the present day, bringing out the fibonacci retracement from swing low to swing high, looking at the bottom of the march 2020 crash, up towards the 69 000 alltime high for bitcoin at the moment
this places the 382 fibonacci level at almost exactly 23 000 per bitcoin
and looking at the 200 week moving average, that is just above 22 000, more specifically, at around 222 k
but it is moving towards 23k at the time of recording this video
so we have both the 200 week moving average and the 382 fibonacci level, which is exactly where the bitcoin price bottoms out at during the 2018 bear markets
and they are coming in confluence at almost the exact same price, at around 23 000
but also keep in mind that 2014 bear market, example, we actually bottomed out in between the 236 fibonacci level and that 382 fibonacci level, and that's pretty much what we're sitting at right now
and going back to that other note that i added in about the 2018 bear markets, was the fact that we did find some shortterm supports at around that 236 percent fibonacci level, just before dropping down towards the 382 fibonacci level for the bottom of the 2018 bear market
and if you're looking right here, we have indeed found some shorts and supports already at that 236 fibonacci level before dropping lower
and if you've been keeping up to date with my bitcoin update videos, especially over the past few weeks, i've been talking about how the bitcoin bottom is most likely at that 25k low or a little bit lower, but not that much lower
so something like 23k, for example, would be congruent with everything that i've been saying in recent weeks
but whether we did bottom out at 25k, or if we have a little bit lower to go, at around 23k, either way, i'm simply dollar cost averaging into bitcoin at the moment, considering how close we are to these lows compared to the alltime highs, for example
and if this scenario does end up playing out, where we potentially revisit that 25k low, or even set in a new low at around 23k, at around those prices, the mid to low 20 000 price range, personally, i'll be going very heavy into bitcoin at those prices if we do go back to those prices
but i want to make it clear that it's not financial advice for you
that is just simply telling you what i am doing with my own money based on this analysis, and just giving you a quick update on the daily bitcoin charts, looking at this fractal technically speaking, it is still in play
and if you want more information about this fractal just here, check out my last video that i posted on the channel, because in that video, i went into more detail about this fractal, and i'm not going to repeat it over and over again for the ones that watch all of my videos
and the same can be said about the shorter term bitcoin price action
here on the four hour chart, not a lot has happened over the past one day
and so the important things to remember about this chart right here haven't changed over the past one day
and bringing out the fibonacci retracement tool from swing low to swing high
we do have the golden pockets coming into play at around 29 and a half thousand, where we have been finding some shortterm support recently
but for the most part, over the past few weeks, obviously, we've been relatively neutral, as i've been talking about on the channel time and time again, ever since around three weeks ago, just after that bitcoin crash down towards 25k
and as for the next volatile bitcoin move, basically we just need to wait for either a break of resistance or support
and now getting into the ethereum part of this video, here, on the daily time frame, obviously we still have this same bullish divergence
and once again, there's nothing much else to add here on top of what i said yesterday
so if you missed my last video, definitely check that one out
and the same can be said about the short term ethereum price action
technically speaking, we still have this descending triangle pattern forming right now
but what i mentioned yesterday is, if we form a higher low here and basically bounce back up towards this resistance without coming back down towards 1700, then in that case, that would potentially invalidate the formation phase of this descending triangle pattern, considering the fact that descending triangle patterns, as bearish patterns, are not meant to contain higher lows
they're simply meant to contain horizontal lows and lower highs
but as of right now, we haven't exactly seen a lot of confirmation for this as the low just yet
which means, technically speaking, it is still possible we could drop down towards around 1700 to put in another horizontal low and continue forming this descending triangle pattern
and this level of resistance is coming into play at around 1950, approximately
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum short positions on the bitfenix exchange here on the daily time frame
and you can see right here that today, alongside the last two days, we have seen more ethereum short positions on the bifinix exchange close
in fact, just within the last three days, we've seen over 30 million dollars worth of ethereum short positions close on the bifinix exchange
and if you're new to the channel and you have no idea what this means, definitely check out my last video, because in that video, once again, i went into more detail about what this exactly means for ethereum
and now taking a look at the ethereum versus bitcoin charts here on the daily time frame right now, if you're looking at the daily candle closes, the ethereum price has now confirmed a lower low on the daily time frame, which is the first step towards confirming this bullish divergence
but we still need to see step number two, which is basically confirming a green daily candle in the price action in order to confirm a higher low in the daily rsi
because right now, obviously the daily rsi is sitting in higher lows, but we haven't confirmed this higher low as a low just yet
technically speaking, we're still heading down until we at least confirm one green daily candle in the price action, because by default, the rsi goes off, candle closes
so we still need to see that extra step of confirmation in order to actually confirm this bullish divergence
and if this does end up confirming, this would signal to us that ethereum could be in for reduced bearish momentum when varied against bitcoin
which means, if this confirms, we could see ethereum maintain its value against bitcoin, or potentially slightly outperform bitcoin in the somewhat shorter term
but obviously, the overall trend is still clearly a bearish trend
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to make more money in crypto, whether or not prices are going up down or sideways
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
you can see that bitcoin has just lost thirty thousand dollars
once again, we're playing ping pong with that level, it seems, jumping up above 30 000, below 30 000
it's like this area has really been stubborn and resilient over the past few months, actually
and, i mean, if you're having a look at bitcoin over here, best case scenarios, you have this diagonal trend line that's tracking up
and price would pretty much need to bounce from right over here if the bulls have any hope, uh, of of regaining this
um, so, yeah, otherwise, we've come back down into the range, the original range that we had over here, which we're stuck in for so long, uh
um, in a choppy environment like this, you can get chopped in and out of the crypto market the whole time
probably going to break back below the key horizontal level again once you start coming down towards these zones over here, and especially when you start to target this area over here, which, just to let you know, is what most of the altcoins look like
most of the altcoins, uh, relative to that previous weak low that they had, are sitting in this zone over here
you know, if bitcoin, which is holding so much of the market dominance at the moment, has to lose these levels and start to target that weak low, can you imagine how bad that's going to be for the alt queens? it's almost inevitable that the altcoins are going to make new lows
that looks like a high probability chance that that would be happening
and speaking of those shortterm setups, let's go on to solano
everything is live and updated, and the link is in the description
but i mentioned that, look, i i am targeting a potential short uh on this particular coin
and this is essentially what i'm seeing, you can see you got lower highs throughout price
once this gets taken out, i would anticipate that price will rapidly move into the liquidity zone, which, just so you know, it's coming in between 1950
so anywhere within that zone is where i'd imagine the bottom will probably be found for something like solana
i do then think that crypto will probably go on to pounce and have some sort of a proper relief rally
but he has, your main momentum line is the one that's tracking those lower highs
he has a more aggressive momentum line over here, this one that's coming down
if i was going to enter this short with high confidence, i was looking to take that entry within the yellow circle over here
and the reason why is just because there's more confluence over here of key horizontal levels, areas of resistance, as well as, most importantly, i have a very easy level of invalidation
if price were to get back above that, my short trade would be invalidated
and the closer i can get to that invalidation point when entering a trade, then the lower my risk and more confidence i can have when taking that trade
once we lose that wick, then, i mean, hopefully you can bounce off of this level over here, that key horizontal
if you don't bounce off of that, then you're going to be coming down towards the next one
and this is the way that i would be playing it on a break over here
so if i were going to enter a short trade at the violation of this week, the way that i would do it is i would have a order set that as soon as it breaks, it immediately enters me with a stop loss right above that line like this
so if i take one of these horizontal lines like this, i would essentially be placing my limit order to enter the trade at the immediate break of that wick
so if you don't know what you're doing, definitely don't take this trade, because you're probably going to get wrecked
and the reason why is, i would anticipate that this will rapidly move down on the break of that
and what i said also, make sure you subscribe to the newsletter, because this is going to be in the newsletter
if you want a written approach, to sit and actually look at the actual charts, then the links for those charts are going to be in the newsletter
you can see it on my twitter account or on sheldon's twitter and you can subscribe over there
but essentially, what you have very similar to solana, right? you have lower highs price
uh, bear in mind that this area over here, this key horizontal
so moving this key horizontal onto daily and zooming out like that, this area has been hit many, many, many times, and it's just a matter of time before it's going to break through
it's like a bouncing ball on thin ice, right? the more times that that ice gets knocked, the higher the probability that you're creating those hairline cracks within the ice, and it's going to snap right through
because this is a descending triangle like this, price is coming down
if price manages to bounce back up over here, by the way, i would be looking to short from this level
so if you see something like this, i'd be looking to short from there and anticipating the same move
and that also comes into a strong liquidity zone, which is ranging between 1 100 and that 1 300 level
so anywhere within there, if you're looking to load up on spot buys, this would be your zone
so this area over here would be your zone to load up on spot buys
and you'd also want to be closing your short if you are going to short this from that level
again, as i mentioned, either testing on the top of that, um, this declining diagonal line
otherwise, what you need to do is wait for the break of this price that you'll have to see on a low time frame, charge something like a 15 minute price will usually bounce around, mess around, come up, retest over there, might even deviate slightly, and then the next round, bam, it's going to be gone
then you set your stop loss just above that area, and it's gonna tank
but it just makes it even more likely that the next time that it comes and tests this level, that price basically will lose that zone over there

in this episode, we're taking a look at the bitcoin price on the four hourly
now, we have been talking about this fractal it's almost been mirroring this kind of situation
so if you have been trading these major levels, you've made huge, huge gains
now i'm going to explain how the btc price can potentially hit the 28 800 in the coming hours, maybe go to slightly lower levels
and also look at this big, major rejection that we did get from this massive, insane level that we've been talking about, also the thirty thousand six hundred dollar area
so what are the most important levels? where could we find training opportunities? this is what you're going to find out in today's episode
new to the channel, make sure to subscribe daily on bitcoin crypto and also the live stream to connect with the community
now, we do have the four hourly chart here in the left, december 2021
since we were trading at 28 600, looking for that movement here to the upside, stopping at 30 500
another leg up, stopping at the 32 000 range, and then potentially getting this major rejection
now there's only one thing here that we didn't kind of mirror in this price action was that bounce? okay? potentially to the thirty thousand five hundred dollar range
if you have been following me for quite some time, you know that we do need, we need to see a consolidation at these certain levels to decide if we are going to enter a trade or not
i did take on this fall for looking for that balance, because i was already in my long and short over here from these levels, taking profits consistently from these movements
now your question might be, and also mine, are we going to continue to the downside after these major consolidations? well, as you can see, this is not very, very um same price action that is happening right now
why is this? because we are basically retesting this trend line, all right? as you can see here on the right, from these lower highs, managing to get support
we did actually get support here for some while, as you can see in december of 2021, when we were trading around about the 46 000 area
in the case of bitcoin, it is at the 28 600 range, as you can see
so i do see that potential leg down to this level to have a consolidation
this is where we did go consolidation, also, back in december 2021
remember, for all of those experienced traders, buybit, my favorite swing trading platform
you can get up to four thousand and fifty dollars claimed at the rewards hub
and on primex bt, my favorite day trading platform, up to seven thousand dollars
you basically get seven percent added to your initial deposit by using bitcoin sensors 50 as the promotion code
i got full video tutorials on how to use these platforms down below
i just want to jump in here on the two hourly chart, and let's just focus on what is happening today
as you can see on the chart, we did get that beautiful bounce from the point of control here, the biggest spike here on the vpvr from the volume traded for the last 25 days approximately
as you can see, all of this volume traded range the biggest point of control was right over here
the value area high from this volume from this range, the thirty thousand five hundred dollars
and you can take advantage of the market to make huge gains, if you know how to position yourself
now, what can i expect you for the btc price? well, in my personal opinion, it is just very, very likely, after the second retest, that this is not going to be a double bottom
we are almost, you know, 70 of of chance here in getting down to this major range
if you do take a look at the volume, all right, the volume is pretty high from this major drop, getting this resistance
so what is the major level that i am looking at here for a potential first stop, or a consolidation? if we do get that consolidation, you know, there is a possibility that we might bounce from this range
but as you know, this might be, you know, the time where it's actually going to break through
the value area low here from the volume trader the last 25 days, is the 28 600
so if we come back down and retest this level, it is just very likely, is it gonna get broken this time? because the more times you retest a level in the past and you come and bang the door again, it's just very likely it is just going to break through
now, if we do break through from this major level, the 28 600, where could we stop? well, i have some very important levels here on the four hourly chart, okay, which i do think the price of bitcoin could stop if we do break through the twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars successfully
if we do break through this range, i am not too sure if we are going to retest the lows here of 25 000 very, very fast
and the reason why i do think that this is going to happen is because we need to get the fibonacci retracement from the lows to the highs
and the 618 is already always an important level where you could get a potential balance
okay, this is the twenty seven thousand nine hundred dollar range, okay, where you could get that volatility
and it's also the four hourly close, okay? just slightly below the sixth one, right here at the 65, as you can see, major fibonacci level here, where you could consolidate in the next coming hours, a few days, if you do break this zone finally, and then get a potential big bounce
now, another reason why i do think that this is going to be a major level where the price action is going to stop, round about the 276, 279 k levels, is if we go to the one hourly, this was some mentioned by someone in in the live stream, of course, today that, you know, what if this is kind of a bear flag, right? and, you know, i was talking about, yeah, i mean, this is very likely to have continuation to the downside, and we are going to get rejected from this huge level
it's just very likely, we were talking about this in the stream, you know, that we were potentially going to break down
and what i want to show you here, if this were to be a bear flag, all right, looking at the one hourly, well, the pole, you could arguably discuss that the pole is, you know, from this high, or from this high over here, i would say, you know, this one right over here
the proper drop, this drop over here, doesn't start till this range
it doesn't really start here, because here what it does, it drops and goes sideways
so the proper drop, looking at the onehour chart, is from here
so you could arguably discuss, take take a look at the pole from all the way down here
if this were to be a bear flag, the measured technical move from the breakout, okay? it's putting the pole at the resistance level from this bear flag, okay, which will be around about this range
you can see here that the 28 000 level would be the potential target
so we were talking about that 279 which is almost hitting the fibonacci retracement
from this major drop, you could get that consolidation and a potential reaction, okay, from this four hourly close that we also do have here, round about that 276 k levels, major level where there's a lot of confluence
once we hit those levels, where do you think we can get major rejection? well it is at the twenty eight thousand five hundred twenty eight thousand six hundred dollar range where we do have those massive, big bounces as support
so if we start breaking this zone with big volume, big, strong candle closers, well below twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
so at twenty eight thousand, twenty seven point six, approximately around those ranges, if we do see big, solid, four hourly candle closers, then, of course, on this retracement and we, if we do consolidate at this 28 600 range, it is highly probable you're going to get rejected, and we might even continue to the downside
so this is the kind of trading range that i am looking for in the next coming hours and few days, guys
so make sure to subscribe to the channel, stay tuned for my major updates
check out bitcoin sensors website, because we got the latest news and articles here posted every single day
in the next coming hours and the next coming days, of course, we're going to analyze the situation to see what is the most probable scenario in the coming hours
and of course, i want to know your opinion from the community
is there those people still there think that we're going to hit alltime high in the next coming months? or are we going to go down to 12 000 bitcoin? i want to know your opinion
we're going to analyze the situation here, the fractal of course
we're going to go in detail of what is happening, all right? and see if we are going to go too much lower levels
because if we start breaking above this major range, it's going to be looking pretty bullish
of course, we're gonna go through natural gas, guys, because, you know, i am trading natural gas right now, and i do think that natural gas at this moment is in a huge distribution event right now, a huge wykoff distribution, and we're going to see natural gas have an insane drop in the next coming weeks
i want to know your opinion on this also, of course, because i can see, you know, a y cup distribution right over here on natural gas
what do you think about this? this is a clear, you know, distribution
in my personal opinion, this means that the money is leaving the market
professional investors, okay, on natural gas, invested in march
in march, they were buying natural gas at these levels, okay? and this is a clear distribution
this means that smart money is very likely leaving the market
you know, i do think it's going to go up in the next coming months, but in the immediate short term, i want to know what's going to happen in the next coming weeks, next, you know, couple of months
i know most of the people think that oil and natural gas is just going to skyrocket also, from this level
i want to remind you, it's already skyrocketed, okay, for the last, you know, three, five months, all right
and this, for me, is a clear distribution event on natural gas
let's see, i am willing to risk some of my capital, because i do see a potential big drop, going all the way down to six dollars, even five dollars, where we do have a large spike here on the vpvr
of course, i am shorting from this peak level on natural gas, waiting patiently
if i just zoom in here, on the four hourly, we're having massive bearish diverges on natural gas
of course, you know, i'd, i'm focused 90 on on bitcoin and crypto, but also, you know, if i do see opportunities and other markets, uh, then i will take it
i'm was waiting here, of course, for this, you know, this last high high over here
getting exhaustion coming back down, coming back up, entering into some positions, into this pullback, of course, over here, right there
i do see a very, very big drop from these levels in the coming weeks on natural gas
now, what is the matter if i were to be wrong on this distribution event on natural gas? well, of course, i am looking, you know, that stop loss above this level
so you enter a position here, and you have this kind of stop loss right up there
what is the projected move at least coming down as low as the, as the six dollar range, 650, at least to this range
so you can see already the risk to reward here is absolutely huge
so that is, you know what i think that is going to happen on natural gas
can this flip suddenly like this and go to much higher levels? yes, of course it can
it is slightly creating higher highs, not managing to hold our support, always dipping below the highs
anybody that is trading some other markets, what do you guys think about this? so anyway, let's go also through the s p 500
are we going to manage to reach the 4 250? that would be my ultra bearish zone, if we start consolidating at this level
if i do have a few minutes, i want to explain why we have the bearish shark pattern
we also have the 50 fibonacci from this high over here in march till the major lows here in may
we do have the d point on the shark pattern that we have been mentioning before
and also it is a clear resistance zone where the prize has struggled to break
okay, so anyway, let me just go quickly through the comment section
any questions i would like to answer? are we gonna see bitcoin managing to break this major zone over here
we do have this big resistance level that we have been getting a reaction as you can see, let's just go to the two hourly zoom in a little bit
we have been getting a reaction from this level, a major level that we have been talking about now for the last few days, which is this one here, at the thirty thousand five hundred dollar range
it has been resistance right now, are we going to manage to break above this range and continue to the upside? this is something that we're also going to analyze, of course, in today's live stream
we just got rejected here, beautifully, from this level, not even hitting the 50 fibonacci 382 around this range, you know, the value area high from the from the volume traded the last 25 days, right now, approximately getting that big resistance
if we do see a solid move to the upside, then this is going to be looking pretty, pretty good
i would be a little bit cautious, because we will be hitting the 618 and very likely gonna get a rejection from that range
but it's very, very possible that if we do break with large volume, okay, if we do see a nice, you know, one hourly, uh, two hourly, even four hourly candlestick here, with large volume from this breakout of this zone of the thirty thousand six hundred dollar range, very likely we're going to get one rejection
because the low here, the low part from this consolidation, is exactly at the thirty one thousand two hundred dollars
so there are some opportunities here for some potential scalp day trades, um and this is what i think about bitcoin
okay, if we do start breaking near this range, there are some major opportunities
now, a question of many, shall we long? shall we short? where is the price going? i do not know where the price is going
to be a successful and a profitable trader, you do not need to know where the price is going
you need to know what levels are strong for potential rejections, of potential bounces, in the case of support
so you can step in, risk some money and, yeah, make some gains
just go for jayco songs, yes? um, yeah, i think, uh, yeah, they're not, um, no, copyright
so, yeah, i think i could not put jay cole songs on the live streams
nicks, how are you doing? mark dutch, how are you doing? hello, crypto legends, i've got my strongest moderator here
mark dutch, how are you doing? i've got david here, also, very strong moderator
andy, what's up? monk, how are you? felipe? um, what's happening? not much
what would be the ideal scenario here? uh, for me, okay, there are two scenarios here where we could take advantage, where i could take advantage
i'm going to say that i'm going to take advantage, because i'm not going to tell you ever what to do
i'm just going to give you my personal opinion, no financial advice
best case scenario for me for bitcoin to, you know, enter a trade here would be getting a react, another reaction
okay? we're going to see another pump, likely on bitcoin to see if we're going to break the 30 700 range
so if we do try and break this range again and get rejected, see a consolidation on the next attempt, trying to break the 30 700, maybe hitting 30 800, which is the 50 level from this drop
if we see multiple attempts in the next coming hours, this is going to be a signal that the bulls are not managing to get above this strong level
and that could potentially be a sign of weakness, where you could enter the market, and you'll be looking for potential retest of these lows that we did create on the first of june, okay, which is all the way down to the 29 300 range
the biggest point of control from the volume traded, where we did get that bounce
you can see it right over here on the chart, where we're getting a reaction
so is it going to be a shorting opportunity? you know, maybe a lot of you have already shorted from this range
have i shorted? no, because i want to see multiple attempts a consolidation
i want to see a reaction, because i don't know whether if the price is going to manage to break it
you know, if it breaks, then i'll be looking, you know, potentially, this is going to be a good rejection at this level
with a 618 from the 31 200 range, 618 from this major drop, and then potentially get a bounce
it's going to be looking pretty good for bitcoin to actually retest the 32 000
i just want to remind you that i am actually still in this short position, okay, a small percentage, taking most of my profits of this position
and i still hold the long position that we were talking about here on the 29th of may
as you can see here at this level over here, the 29, the 28 000, um, 28 900 range
guys, if you are interested on bit, you do get an insane bonus
if you scroll down, you do have the bonus here, up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus, zero percent
primex bt, you get seven percent added to your deposit, up to seven thousand dollars
okay? it's another way to support the channel, for me to still create, you know, more content every single day
of course, it's another, you know, i do get a small commission, of course
um, through the comment section, summer is coming, absolutely uh
i um, if, obviously, if, if bitcoin does also, if bitcoin does want to have that major drop, if bitcoin does want to have that major rejection from this 30 600 range, then of course, ethereum will follow
ethereum and other altcoins are looking much weaker than bitcoin
and why is this? is because of the bitcoin dominance is actually going up
why? because you are getting selling pressure, creating lower highs, and it's getting very much respected
as you can see on the chart, we've got a solid base here around about the 21, 22 range
as you can see, it's very, very likely that we are going to retest this level
maybe potentially going to get another bounce, but this is usually a bearish pattern
if we start seeing bitcoin very, very bearish, then no doubt in my mind we actually gonna fall down the 21 range here, which is holding very, very nicely as support for the moment
so what would be the bullish case scenario? where would i be finding trading opportunities if avalanche does manage to break here? the 28 range, where we do have this major support level that, when we broke, managed to hold as resistance
it's also the last lower high from this pattern, from the, you know, we've been trading inside of this range for about 25 days right now
so if we do solidly break out from this last lower high here, which is the 28 range, approximately, we're on a solid breakout
i would be waiting patiently for a retracement and the consolidation at this range
if we do get that consolidation, it is one of the largest point of controls here at the 28 29 range, as you can see
and it would be the last lower high and a big, major support resistance that should be turning again into support range
that would be the kind of movement that we would be looking for this range on avalanche
if it were to be a bullish case, right? this descending triangle is a bearish pattern
we have the selling pressure, you know, probabilities also in breaking here
okay? that would be looking at avalanche on the immediate short term
of course, if we go to the three day chart and zoom out, you know what a major correction has avalanche had? it's gone absolutely insane
of course, there is a possibility that avalanche is going to consolidate at this range, not not seeing major, big movements
the reason why is because it's a major, major level here that we have been consolidating for many months back in 2021
so it could be a large, large, large consolidation with small dumps and small pumps
and i think it will be an accumulation zone, in my personal opinion, like like baby says, racing pixel
can you check btc dominance key levels? let's take a look at the bitcoin dominance
um, see what's going on here on the bitcoin dominance right away
i am looking for the bitcoin dominance in the coming weeks and months, just because of this solid breakout bearish sentiment
always, when we have, always, 90 of the times when there is crypto market bearish sentiment and we're having a massive, big downtrend, it is, um, you know, 90 of the times, the bitcoin dominance, um, pumps
and, um, you know, moving money from all coins into bitcoin, because it's the safest asset inside of the crypto space, right? it is, the more it is, the less volatile
it is more solid, and it does survive better, um, the dumps in a bear market
of course, you if you have a lot of all coins and don't hold bitcoin, then very likely you are going to be in in a much, much larger loss
so this is what usually happens key levels on the bitcoin dominance? well, of course, we do have this range over here
there is a possibility that you might get a small rejection from this range
forty seven point five percent, approximately, which is, uh, um, this lower high over here on the bitcoin dominance
and then very likely, you are finally, in the next coming months, going to see that leg up all the way here to the 50, in between 50 and 55 percent
and there is where i'm looking that it's to add a lot of altcoins
you know, if we do see the bitcoin dominance at those levels, it's going to be the moment, in my personal opinion, to absolutely stack a huge amount of altcoins
as soon as we see bitcoin dominance trading around about the 53 54 55 ranges, it will be the moment to enter aggressively into all coins
of course, you want to get into solid projects, of course, such as ethereum, you know, maybe cardano, maybe, um, some l2 cert jazmatic network, polygon matic, and it will be the moment to enter into some altcoins
and just to get ready for that potential bull run that will happen in 2024, 2025
so, yeah, it's going to be late 2022, beginning of 2023, where you are actually going to have, you know, insane opportunities to scoop up some altcoins that could have huge gains in the next few years
i think we could get a rejection where we could get some relief, rallies on all coins
at this level, at the 47 475, we could consolidate here for the next coming days and get a small pullback
of course, because markets move in waves, we could get that wave, and then the next big, major wave is going to be the one that actually massively pumps to around about the 54 um bitcoin dominance
all right? and maybe have that large consolidation at this level, and you might have a big, bigger, uh, you might have a lot, a lot of time here, several months, to actually scoop up some altcoins
usdt, uh, who has not smashed the light button yet and why? says tracy, right, yeah
oh, yeah, i've, i've got something here on polka dot we were analyzing, uh, at some point, i can't remember, this was actually used for a post on the twitter account on bitcoin sensors
i think we don't need to go as far, you know, on the daily chart, three day
um, reason, let me just clear something here, zooming out on this chart, one of the main reasons we're getting a consolidation, we're getting a stop at these levels, is because we did have have a consultation in january
okay, 15 days, consolidating round these levels in between eight and ten dollars
okay, we are getting this consolidation thanks to this spike on the vpbr, thanks to that reaccumulation that we did have in january of 2021
and this is, this is good to to check, check out the bitcoin dominance
um, let's go to the bitcoin dominance because, uh, zoom out a little bit
if we are going to hit, you know, if we have been pumping like crazy for the last couple of weeks on the bitcoin dominance, we have been pumping like crazy
um, we can expect some kind of retracement on the bitcoin dominance at these major levels, at the 475 approximately
um, we can get a rejection from this range, start consolidating, or maybe have a small correction
okay, so i am looking for that potential rejection from this range on the bitcoin dominance
so if this happens, you could assume, all right, this means that some money in bitcoin, some capital, will be flowing into all coins
so if you start seeing some all coins, such as polkadot, which is a very, very strong, solid project, and you start seeing this kind of formation here on the four hourly, it is very, very possible you are creating an inverse head and shoulder here
so the possibilities here on polka dot, potentially to come up and retest here the 1050 zone, is very, very likely
of course, an inverse head and shoulder is, you know, you want to see a breakout from this zone
uh, to actually confirm, if you do break out from this level, it is likely to get a bunch of liquidity all the way up here at the 12 range
so you start getting that breakout, that come back down, a solid breakout, retesting this 1050 range, you could assume that you are going to have that leg up, very likely to get a bunch of liquidity from this, um, 12 range, these highs over here
so, you know, potential liquidity grab maybe to continue to the downside
if you do consolidate right over here, it is likely to get that rejection back down, something very similar to what happened to bitcoin, right? but, um, right over here
we were looking for that liquidity grab at these levels, okay, at these highs
we have seen a lot we, you know, a lot of altcoins are not managing to go up there yet
but if the bitcoin dominance is, you know, been pumping like crazy, and we are ready, potentially in the next coming days, for the bitcoin dominance to start having a corrective move, all right, for the coming weeks, maybe, all right
we still could pump a little bit more, 4748, and then start getting that potential rejection here in the next coming weeks
so we could see this kind of scenario on polka dot where we may be going to manage to reach round about the 12 range for that liquidity grab
if we start consolidating at this level, of course, it will very likely gonna get, uh, get a rejection to continue back down
of course, you know, at the end of the day, we are in an aggressive downtrend
all right, um, i will, i'm, i'm not looking for any trades on polkadot at the moment
on on polka dot, you are seeing, you know, a small inverse head and shoulder here on the four hourly that you could potentially reach these levels to get that liquidity grab
so it's not off the cards that you might have that that potential leg up in in the next coming days on polka dots to to reach this high over here, maybe consolidate and continue to the downside
i think most of the people think that polkadot is going to come down to retest the seven dollars in the next few days
because, you know, if you use a basic market structure, you know, lower highs, you you're very likely going to think that this is going to roll back down and retest this range
um, but before that happens, i think a liquidity grab up here is very, very likely
because if i go back to bitcoin, guys, remember, you know, we were talking about the same thing on bitcoin, right over here, where we were talking about, you know, most of the people think that we are going to retest the 25 000 range, okay, the 25 000 lows
you're having this dead cat bounce, and you are creating lower highs
you're slightly creating lower lows, a lower low, right there
while most of the people were looking for that roll back down at this low, 25 000, what we were talking about here on the channel is that big, massive movement to get that liquidity grab from this last big, lower high range that wasn't retested yet
soon as you retested it, then, yes, we are ready to continue back down
as you can see, bitcoin dominance does help, uh, does help with this potential movement
it is maybe ready, in the next coming days, for that potential correction, consolidation
uh, you know, even if we consolidate, it might be good for all coins
um, so consolidation or retracement in the coming days, it will be good for that relief rally on some altcoins
uh, ftm andy, can you take a look at uh, at s and p 500? absolutely
it might have some small pumps to the upside, and i'm gonna explain why
we did have this correction, uh, right over here, and then we've had a leg up
so is it going to manage to have a little bit of more pumpy action create a slightly higher high here? it would be nice to see, you know, just for entertainment purposes, because this is not the best um indicator in the world, but that would be nice to see some bearish divergence here on on the rsi, on the four hourly, right where you are going to have that leg up here on the s p 500
i mean, today's friday markets close, yeah, it's probably just going to consolidate at this range
but it would be nice to see that leg up, if we have that leg up here by the end of the day to the 4240 4250
it's going to take a lot of power, a lot of, um, a lot of capital, to move the s p 500 all the way up there in the next coming hours
but if it does, you will be creating these aggressive bearish diversions, you know
and this is only one thing, of course, i do not trade um with the rsi just because of divergence, of course
you are hitting, you know, you will be hitting a major resistance zone, not because you are creating a lower high on the rsi here
so basically you have the rsi creating some bearish divergence, only if we were to have that leg up
if we were to have that leg up, this is a moment that i'll be extremely bearish
you know, this is the moment i will be ready to trade the market
so this is the thing, i do not know at this current point if the s p 500 is going to drop or is going to pump
so you might think, oh, you could not make any money then, you know, you cannot trade it because you don't know where the market is going to go
but if we do come all the way up here, you know, between friday and monday, and between today and monday, this is a huge level on the s p 500, the four thousand two hundred and fifty dollar fifty point
why is it such a strong level? well, first of all, we do have this shark pattern respecting very much this movement right over here
that d point, which is at the 4 240, is a strong, major level where we could get that potential rejection
this is a bearish pattern, shark pattern over here, that should be coming all the way down to the four thousand dollar point area
and, uh, because that is the target, all right? would be fifty percent, uh, fibonacci and six, one eight from c to d point
so if we do have that leg up, i do see the s p 500, you know, by next week, having this potential correction
um, why is it also a big major level? well, if we take a look at 50 fibonacci retracement here, from the highs of the 29th of march, we got the highs here all the way up at the 4 635 points approximately, down to the lows of the of of may
what else? we have the resistance trend line, let me just get fibonacci out of the way here
resistance trend line from the lower highs, you've got lower highs right over here
it's the, the trend line is exactly at this level in the next coming days, hours, at this 4 250 points resistance trend line
confluence number five, you do get that reaction in between four
um, four thousand two hundred and fifty and four thousand three hundred
as you can see, we created a kind of a double bottom right there
it was acting as resistance because confluence number five, it's a super strong level
if the s p 500 gets all the way back up here, there's so many things to add up on the chart that it's very, very likely going to get that potential rejection
but if it has that leg up, i would be ready with my sniper to actually give it a shot, give it a shot on a short opportunity, especially if we get that kind of consolidation a couple of weeks to the upside
that will give me confident i'll be, you know, definitely shorting this on on, on primexpt
if we do get that leg up, guys remember on primexpt, you got an insane bonus down below of up to seven thousand dollars
you basically get seven percent added to your deposit, seven percent added to your deposit
let's take a look here at the uh, paul m, thanks for the super chat
let me know if you want me to take a look in the comment section
uh, no questions from paul m, just saying that, hope we start a trend
i want to take a look at, you know, each kryptos and do a little bit of proper analysis, and then i'll take a look at waves, i promise
i mean, something interesting to point out on cardano is that we did, you know, check out this resistance trend line, okay? and this happens on a lot of assets where you are creating, you know, the lower highs, aggressive lower highs, and you start breaking here, this aggressive downtrend
of course, we are still in a downtrend, but this is just showing exhaustion
all right? as soon as you start breaking a resistance trend line, then you show an exhaustion
we actually retested this resistance trend line to perfection on the drop of the 12th of may
we have the resistance trend line from the lower highs, you break out of it, and you retested it, and get a bounce here to perfection, quite a quite nice, small swing
let's analyze the situation here and zoom in on the four hourly to see, you know, what could happen with cardano
let's see if i do have some some levels here marked up right? very hard, very hard to very volatile crypto, no doubt about that
if the cardano price comes down and retested this low, that would, that's where i would be finding my trading opportunity
we basically got one bounce from the strongest point of control, from the volume traded the last 2025 days, as you can see these, this is the four hourly chart, 20 25, uh days
um, we did get above some major resistance levels right over here, but we went up
so we did get a couple of bounces from this range, but we're not managing, you know, to see any strength here, uh, on on cardano, to to continue back up
what is happening right now, this is very, very likely to get rejected and come down to retest again the 54 cent range
if we do come down on cardano, retest the 54 range and consolidate, fail to break down below here, the 52 cent range, it is very, very likely gonna get a bounce from this level
and you might may ask, you think you may ask yourself, why? why do you think we're going to get a bounce from this range? basically we have the biggest point of control from from the last 25 days for about one month
and biggest point control is right there at the 50 to 53 cent level
it would, um, we've had massive volume, huge volume on this pump on cardano
it was a little bit of speculation either should i think there's some upgrades to come in june on cardano
so once that news, you know, was launched, of course, that, you know, the speculation was done already
people were buying up into that potential, you know, cardano upgrade that's going to happen in june
people speculate before the actual upgrade, or whatever it's going to be, happens
because 60 or 70 percent of things that, you know, uh, charles hoskinson says, uh, it doesn't happen
okay? he's been lagging so much on on cardano, you know, smart contracts and and many, many things that, yeah, is is basically a lagging uh, blockchain project
so anyway, um, talking about the technical analysis, a potential abc correction is very, very possible here on this potential move
you know, can this be the start, okay, of a higher low over here on cardano? i think it is likely
i think it is likely to come down to retest, you know, this 53, 52 cent range, dipping below slightly this range, looking for that abc correction
if we get that volatility, if we do get that consolidation, this is going to be looking very, very bullish at this range
biggest, stronger point, strongest point of control we've got
um, very likely it's going to be around about the 618 from this actual low of the pump
so yeah, that six one eight, we actually got the beautiful bounce already from the six one eight, almost to the exact, almost to the exact scent here, from the lows
i'm getting the exact low from the 27th of may here on the four hourly chart
the exact low and the exact high from the 31st of may, sorry, 27th of may, to the 3rd, 1st of may, look how the price of cardano comes to touch, to the exact scent, right? that 618 level
of course, it was a little bit aggressive because we didn't get a consolidation
on this leg up, you're hitting the six one eight to perfection, which is, i mean, whoever says that fibonacci doesn't work, i mean, you haven't, you haven't actually used it as much, uh, and traded, uh, fibonacci levels, because they're absolutely magical
um, what else do we have as confluence? i mean, this, you know, the the point of control with this major consolidation, six one eight
if you were to long this level, okay, where would you take profits
where would you take profits? and it's pretty clear you would take profits right now
okay? you were in a profit right now, you actually, the price is stopping there, so you can take profits, uh? if you were to long this 618 from this big, massive pump
you got large volume, okay? from this pump to get that potential bounce at the 618, and the largest point of control from the volume traded of the last 25 days
you know, that is a, it's a, it's um you know, you have high probabilities in having a winning trade if you long from this level, from this 53 level all the way to 60 cents, you know, all the way to this level over here, because this is where you are going to get a stop
it's a take profit zone, because you're probably going to get rejected and continue back down to retest again this 5354
and if you consolidate on the second attempt here, dipping slightly below the 53, you are looking for that abc correction
and all this points out that this could happen, if we do see cardano come down to retest the 53 cent level and get a consolidation, you know, and and you've got the bitcoin dominance, you know, it's just about to have a corrective move
you know, these large, top 20, top 30 blockchain projects, you know, some of them will potentially be getting this relief rally
of course, i could see that correction happening in the next coming hours, couple of days down, back down to that 53, 52 cent range on cardano
i just want to go do kind of not full analysis, because this is not full analysis
full analysis would be looking at daily levels, weekly levels, zooming out, you know, looking at elliott wave
i just want to focus on on basic, pretty basic ta, a little bit of fibonacci, looking at, you know, what could happen? what are the strongest levels guys? because, yeah, it's missing mission
okay? because, yeah, i really want to share, um, obviously, knowledge and technical analysis, and looking for training opportunities with, uh, with a team
okay, uh, for for this, because it's going to be absolutely insane
so yeah, if you want to join, i will let you know in the next live streams, of course, and videos for the world series of trading on bibit, which is going to be absolutely insane, coming up in the next coming weeks
uh, let me just point out here, we are a very large point of control, pretty large volume to the upside on on waves
if anything, i would be looking for shorts at this level, if we have a next attempt on waves, and and get rejected, if the next level is rejected here, we got one, we got three, we got two
if the next pump gets a big, large wick, a big, large correction here, we are very likely coming down on waves
and i would be looking, i would be looking, yeah, it take, i mean, a target area for waves here, it was going to be complicated
we'd be looking at these for for fibonacci levels, 50 50 is an insane level
it is exactly at this major support range, at the 780, 780 range
waves has had shown me that i need to stay away from it for trading
i need to stay, i mean, all depending if you want to buy and hold
i think, you know, it's been an insane project, been over five years, uh
it does have a pretty nice track record, huge investors behind it
but this is you know, pure manipulation on on on, on the price
i mean, i don't this massive pumping dump that happened in the last few couple of months
i did make some winning trades also, um, didn't make much on waves
i i stay away for trading on on waves, unless there's a very clear opportunity
so what i think here on waves is that you could get that rejection from this level
could you get another pump here? you're getting rejected from the 50, from this major drop
could you get hit the 618? maybe, if you hit the 618 and get rejected, you know, you are slightly creating higher highs
it's kind of small distribution, consolidation, ready to have that another pump to the downside, and maybe then create a higher low
if you consolidate at this level, i would be, i would wait patiently for the next leg up
it does look like it wants to have that next leg up, that next attempt to go to higher levels
if you start seeing rejection here, then, you know, potential stop loss is good at this range
if you do see rejection for that small correction here, down at least to this lows, to the, to these lows, at the 8780 range
so you could get that correction down to the 780 if you fail on the next leg up
first of all, is, is this bear fly flag in the 30 minute chart on, is this a bear flag in the 30 minute chart on bitcoin? natalie, thank you very much for the super chat
let's take a look at the 30 minute chart on bitcoin to see if this is a bear flag
um, is this a bear flag? on the 30minute chart, we are in a rising channel with the target of 29 300
i mean, this is a little bit overextended, but, yeah, this is a major level
i'm happy with my trade that i got in here and the one that i got here
i mean, it can be, it's a little bit over extended, a little bit over extended, but you could arguably discuss that it is a bear flag
okay, you could arguably discuss that, yeah, it's a kind of a bear flag, right? yeah
as soon as you start losing the last higher low, in this case, it would be this one at the 30 240, uh, you can probably get start to make an aggressive fall from this range
i mean, this is the thing, if we have one more last leg up, i mean, i'm so patient by waiting, i want to see, you know, multiple attempts in breaking a resistance zone
you know, try and break it, try and break it, try and break it
if it fails, if it has a large consolidation, then, yeah, it's very likely going to have that that move back to the downside
uh? i got someone saying that this bear flag is target is twenty nine thousand three hundred dollars
okay, if we take a look at volume, volume is pretty high from the drop
you know, you can see some spikes in volume, but the volume is much lower from the drop, as you can see
and this is the thing, you know, if you want to read volume, okay, i would also, i mean, volume is super important for me
this is something i will add up on a course learning how to read volume
all right, which is pretty simple, in my my opinion, where you do have, when you're going in a direction, you have big, massive pumps in the consolidations
if you see volume going down, it is very likely to continue the trend where the highest volume is, right? of course, this has been pumping for quite some some time, for the last few days, since the 28, 28 500 range all the way up to 32 000
there will be a moment, after creating several waves, where the price will be getting exhausted
there will be a moment, if you finish the waves, that you're not going to continue the trend
but this is also elliot wave theory, something that i want to explain also, but it's, it doesn't take five minutes, of course
so, um, yeah, this is why, what i think here, after this severe drop, who is winning the battle? who has broken major support levels? the bears
so looking at the probabilities, because i'm not going to say this is going to do this, bitcoin's going down to 25k
if you start, you know, having a large a ego and saying, you know, oh, yeah, the price is going here because i think so because of this and that
yeah, you're not going to be a successful trader if you start, if you do have big, um, large ego, if, uh, you need to take a look at the probabilities
probabilities is telling me that it is mo most likely that the bitcoin price is getting rejected from this thirty thousand five hundred dollar, thirty thousand six hundred dollar range, and we are going to continue to the downside
if you were to see this as a textbook bear flag, then, yeah, uh, the poll could, you could arguably discuss, you could get it from this range, from this one over here, and and this, depending on where it breaks out, where it breaks down, this could take you to this potential, you know, textbook target
but, yeah, the 28 000, 28 300, 28 300, 27 800, you know, it's, it's very possible, where is our next major liquidity grab? you know, below these lows, below these loads
so it does make sense that this is going to make this kind of price action it, you know, it could also happen
again, if we do have another attempt on hitting the 30 600, 700 range, have multiple failed attempts, then, yeah, it's, it's time to be bearish
i'm actually going to put an alarm here, because i will be finishing the stream
i'm going to create an alarm here, exactly at 30 700 range, approximately
once i get my message, i'm going to see how the price action is going to react
you could either slice through here this range, and then, you know, there's no trade opportunity for me
uh, if it's with large volume and we do correct with low volume, and we do get a reaction, that would be the next opportunity
uh, if we do see multiple attempts here, uh, once my i have my alarm on my phone, multiple attempts trying to break the zone
i'll be potentially be stepping into a trade for a short position, if this does happen in the next coming hours
um, but yeah, so far, you know, until i do, until i see that reaction, i'm not stepping in a trade because, you know, maybe a lot of people are shorting already from this level
and let me tell you one thing this too, it's probably too early
can we roll down from here? yeah, but it's probably too early to short
a lot of these over leveraged positions might get wicked out first, and then you're gonna go down
and this is what i am waiting for, these wicks, these kind of wicks to the upside
i'm going to try and do another live stream today, or a video update, focusing on bitcoin, focusing on, you know, some you know, i'm gonna, i wanna, i'm gonna ask the community in the telegram group, i'm gonna ask them for five all coins
okay, which one would you like me to analyze with my next bitcoin analysis? and i'm going to ask the community in the telegram group
so make sure to join down below in the description, the official telegram group

check out bitcoin center's website for the latest news articles, technical analysis ideas
thank you very much for joining the live stream, and i will see you in the next one
in today's episode, i will show you why i saw the market on bitcoin at 30 492
i went into a market execution, but we were inside the fibonacci levels 15 61, and i just saw the market because i knew this was where the market were supposed to pull back to give me a retest and then see the drop we are about to hit my take profit at 29 570
and i will also show you the super perfect entry that i had on aave, also from this morning live stream
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly, step by step, why i took this trade on bitcoin
but i sold the market at thirty thousand four hundred and ninety two and my target is at twenty nine thousand five hundred and seventy
i just saw the market because we were at the exact level where the 15 61 percent was, where i did expect the market to pull back up to
so i just went to market execution, as i said, and the market is now almost hitting my target
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on bibles up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this was not a swing trade, but swing trading is really good when it comes to buy bit because we can hold our positions for a longer time with a very low fees
and that is why it's good, not needed today, because the market went to my take profit in just in a couple of hours
but don't forget to claim the bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars
what we're gonna do is that we're gonna go to the two daily chart
and what we could see is that we tried to break this previous support
if we go back in time to july, we can we were below this level
so we saw the market try to break this previous support, turn it into a new support
but what happened the candlestick, after the breakout candle, did close below it
and when we go down to the lower time frames, what i did was that i took a fibonacci from the last high, the fake out, back down to the low that we did have around twenty nine thousand two hundred and ninety four
go down to the lower time frames, you could see the market came back up and retested the fifty percent that we did have around thirty thousand five hundred and twenty
one of the confirmations that i did was that this was the fake out
this was the break inside of the support that would try to break
usually you see the market pull back up to the exact same previous resistance
also, where you've seen the market try to break so many times before, you saw this exact same thing that happened here
you saw the market try to break the resi the support resistance
and this is exactly what we're seeing at the moment with this fake out that you could see
if we go back down to the lower time frames, what i also did, of course, if you've been looking at my videos, you know exactly what i do to figure out if the market is actually doing what i think it's supposed to do
we go down to the lower time frames, and this was exactly what i saw
so i took a support trend line, i just connected it with the higher lows
now, the 15 minutes, what i did was that i took the fibonacci from 30 and 600, from the last high, back down to the load the break of the supported trend line, and that was around thirty thousand three hundred and thirty eight
so this was exactly where i saw the market on a market execution on buy bit
i was looking at exactly the break and retest i saw the market
and based on this fibonacci, i didn't have these three targets
but based on this fibonacci, we also took target one, target to target three
so another thing that we can do we drag a fibonacci from thirty thousand two hundred and eight back down to twenty nine thousand seven hundred and ten, and we will at least come back down to this previous support that we do have, around 28 700
this is where i definitely believe that we can soon come back down to the same thing on ethereum, we're just gonna it just, we're just gonna take this previous report on the weekly chart, we go down to the lower time frames and we can just adjust it a little bit
and when we finally saw the break, market came back up again, trying to make this previous support as a new support
or we can just look at it, mark it, try to break the support, try to connect it, try to make another support
so we can go back and see now what happens on the lower time frame
so what we're gonna do is that we're dragging support trendline, because this is how we connect the dots
and with the dots, with this higher low, can you see how market broke it? you saw a little retest
and what can potentially happen now? well, i strongly believe that we will, first of all, come back down to the support around one thousand and seven hundred
this is something that i've been talking about also, for a long time
and if you were on my morning live stream that i did have this morning, even though i am no financial advisor, but this trade on aave was beautifully i told everyone that from this level, we can expect the market to drop
we do have the pullbacks, just the same way we have it on bitcoin and on ethereum
so we can drag another fibonacci from the last high to the low one
you can see how we almost came back up now, and we tested it 50
so we can pull back up to 106, or potentially 1075 dollars for then see the market giving us another lower high, and then see the continuation down
target 3, 100, and take profit 3 will be 97, based on this fibonacci
but target 1, on the first fibonacci that we did have, from 100, 110 dollars, take profit one, is at 102
so if you were in my live stream, even though i am no financial advisor, because i only share my thoughts, this was a great setup that i had for myself
thank you so much guys for looking at this video together with me
hit the notification so you know when i am live later today, because we will have a new york session live stream and a back testing live stream together with each other
so if you want to see more of what's happening with the coins, or if you want to back test with me in practice what i do on the charts, you hit the notifications so you know when i am live
and as always, i wish everyone a great weekend, and we see each other later
the fun just giving everyone the concept of my computer is so slow
so if there any any beautiful people writing to me in the chat, i can't see you, so just one second
but that's good, because while people are dropping in, i'm giving this the rest of them, the content to this morning live stream
okay, it's really starting to get annoying with the slow computer thing
i bought another oat milk, and it just doesn't work good with my coffee
how are you? uh, dickie, dick, did something awaken? soul blog
um, because if you're new to the channel, or everyone, i usually, i will have back testing sessions, but tomorrow i couldn't do it
um, so, yeah, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
have you ever thought about why they never show us any good news? because they want to keep you depressed
but it is the first, uh, uh, week of the month, so this is the time when you, uh, we have a lot of, we have a lot of news coming out
they give out new numbers on when it comes to employment and stuff like that
i'm not going to say too much, but i know that we, yeah, um, haven't had a tv since 2010
i gave it away because i'm like, i don't even, i don't even look at tv
okay, going to shall we start off with dxi? okay, this is obvious not gonna work, so i need to take it away
i was, i was looking at it like, a little bit wrong yesterday
um, because when we're looking at dxi, the market is clearly not done with the movement to the downside
and that is why the market is also going up on bitcoin, even if we had a drop yesterday
but if if we're looking at dxi, and we're looking at the daily, you remember when i said that we did break this previous support, usually can become a new resistance
so when, when, when this candlestick, i think this was a couple of days ago
so when we had these two pushes to the upside, bitcoin went, okay, make no sense
but anyways, i checked efib now from low, now, sorry, from high to the low on the daily now
if not, if we break, if we break below, uh, 101615, that is definitely, definitely, because we can still come back down to the 50 and then slowly see the market reverse
so as long as we are above, as long as we are above hundred and 101507, um, you know, you can see the marquee consolidate, and then maybe, you know, you see the push
now, if we close below one hundred, one point, five hundred fifty, so it's always around these levels, right? um, that could be us pushing back down to 100 points, 860
so if we go to to bitcoin to connect, or just try to realize to look at it
so the first thing that i saw, or the first thing that i did, was that, on the daily, i connected the trend line
i remember when i said that we are never allowed to cut down a candle, so we are never allowed to get cut these candles, just so, just because we want to connect, it with these, uh, lower eyes
we always need to follow this one, because what can happen is that when the market pushes back up, when the market pushes back up, um, to if, if the market does that, we can come up to the trend line, and you'll see how perfectly the market will retest this trend line, only because we have the trend line in such a perfect way
so when the market pushes back up to these levels, you can definitely see a drop
because usually when the market comes, remember also when they say it is the third touch of a support or a trend line, where you see the bounce
so if the market pulls back up to this, uh, level, that is definitely, you will definitely see a bounce back down
because it's so hard for the market to, you know, break in and then slowly and steady, uh, break to the upside
and this is also the daily so you will see on the lower time frame some movements
you just might not see it so much on on the daily candle overall
but the more you zoom in, the more volatile the the candlesticks becomes
because that's, you know, sometimes i can be, you know, we can look at the charts and then someone's like, oh, bitcoin is pumping
i'm like, where's the market pumping? but if you look at the three minutes chart, because some people does that, i'm like, of course the market is pumping, because you're looking at the lowest time frame
so that is why on the higher time frames you will not see the volatility as much
uh, can you look at october usdc, is that some subset joke, or am i confused? okay, so, but to look at b2c, what can happen? okay, so we i do have in mind that the market on dxi, it's on its way
so i think we took it to the we took it on the 12 12 hourly chart
we took the fibonacci from 36 068 um back down to the to 25 300
another thing that we can do, we can also use this trend line, or, sorry, this fibonacci against the against the wick at 28, no, sorry, the close of the body at 28 225
um, i think it's too tight to to where the price is at the moment
and it kind of does that when we look at it, because if we see the push to the trend line, you will also, and usually the market try to break the trend line
but that is only because we just might need to come back up and retest the 618 percent at 33 077
and then we just might see the market close below, retest from below, and then you see the market push back down again
because, as i told you, i don't think that everything is done yet
so the market is consolidating in between, uh, 31 twenty eight thousand six hundred and twenty
so the market is in a sideways market, and this is why we see the market bounce in between also
so when when we are in a sideways market, um, the mark we usually see a lot of fake outs
another thing that we can do is that we connect this support trend line on the day, on the 12 hour leave, because you can see how the market came back down and retested that level
um, you can see if we drag it from 28 624 back up to 31 780, that is also combined with the fibonacci level
so we can go down to the lower time frames and see exactly what happened
i mean, it we could obviously not have, you have used the trend line, uh, until this higher law was created, because you need to have, you need to have certain dots where you connect everything together
so this is also something that we can play around now, like, okay, so for example, if we know that this hasn't happened yet, we couldn't, in our mind be like, okay, but maybe if i only use the trend line against these two weeks, because that is it is showing us the way
and when we do that when we connect these two dots together, the market came back down, and we tested them so perfectly
and then when you see the market giving us the candlesticks as the higher low, we can just adjust it against this, uh, this price at 20 29, 674
so when we saw the market pushing back down to these levels, this was not how i was looking at the charts yesterday
and now i only do the back testing to make sure that we understand what, what is actually happening
because what the market does from here is what we what we look at, right? um, we can also do this
so, okay, so yesterday we saw the market having this huge drop yesterday
so there it's nothing, it's not good trendline to have here, to be honest
slowly and steady we are now, uh, continuing up, continuing up
one thing that i could do again is i drag fib from 29 504 back up to, uh, thirty thousand six hundred and eight
so if we still combining the support trend line like this, it could make sense, because the market, uh, could come back down now for a potential next higher low around 3075 and potentially 29 950
and then we can see the market push back down to these levels
okay? take profit one will be thirty thousand eight hundred and fifty two
take profit two would be thirty one thousand four hundred and eight
and take profit three, thirty one thousand eight hundred and eighty seven
but as you guys already know, we can also push back up to 32 060 and 32 960 if we break below the support trendline
if we see the market breaking the support trendline and you see a recess from below, that could be when the market doesn't have the power to continue to the upside
so this, this support trendline inside the sideways market, is really important for us, because you can definitely see the market just pull back down to the support again
and that is why it's really good that we're looking at the overall picture and always have in mind that the market can go down, the market can go up
our only job is to make sure that, you know, am i selling the market or buying the market? sometimes you're right, sometimes you're wrong, right? but this is what i see right now when it comes to ethereum, i hope you understood that
so if we're gonna do the same thing, we'll drag the fibonacci
we would drag the, we connect the dots with the trend line, because we don't have to focus on what's happening here, right? it has make no sense to look at what's happening here when we try to understand what's happening here
how are ya? but we also, we also came back down and we've been talking
but i think it's really important for us to do that, um, because that's how we all obviously also learn
how are you? one, one, one, guys, put one, one, one in the chat if you love this live stream, and if you love your life, put to 2, 2 2
if you don't like your life, so we just know where you are, so we can push you to love your life again
so many people feel good and all ready for new beginnings together with natalie
if you want to be part of bitcoin census community, name alone 222
if you want to be part of natalie's community, my community, you want to have more direct contact with me
and i'm so happy that you guys found each other through this community
i have so many, many beautiful messages telling me that so many people are happy that they have the community, and they finally find so many good people that can help them with trading, or just overall talk about things
you have the chat to my chat in the community, chat in the live chat
okay, so you're more than welcome we talk about cryptocurrencies
this is just for you and me to be able to talk with people that have the same passion
must be dreaming, you know, you're, you're, oh, you, you could be dreaming
you could, okay, but continue with ethereum, we connect the dots with the lower, the first push the lower high
we are at the support right? but we can also do this, at least that's how i can do it
you can use it in so many different ways, so many different ways
so what we're gonna do? okay, so we're slightly below the, we are slightly below the, oh, how do you say it? it doesn't look the same as some bitcoin
okay, so what we're looking at right now, we're looking at a demand zone
we can come back down to this level and then slowly, instead, you can see the market consolidate, or you see the market having to push to the upside
because when we come back to a previous demand zone, usually what the market does is that we just go down there quick, and then you see the market push it, right? um
so on the lower time frames, you can see that when we did have, um, a couple of huge care uh, we did have some huge, uh, candlestick, um, since, uh, 31st of may, we've been in a downtrend
and we can also see that on the lower time frames, you're also consolidating
so this is just a very ugly market for me, myself to be inside, because you can see the market also bouncing between
but what we can do is that if we break, if we break one thousand eight hundred and ten eight and around ten you see retails from below, that could be to push back down, because you just might see the market need to fill, uh, back down to 1760
so this is where you can slowly start to see the market push back up
so because, but we need to break, we need to break the the consolidation market that we're inside now
and based on this huge drop, but we're still creating, you see how we're still creating a higher low
and then slowly, instead of break up, right? i'm not saying that the market will break up forever
it's only that we just might need the market to give us a, um, a bigger, a bigger push, right? because let's look at the hard time frames
i just want to see how it looks so this is typically fake out
so what i did just so you can understand when we, uh, because we did break a support a couple of days ago
these two candlesticks right here were the fake out from the support
so that is why i don't use this level as a support, uh, in this case
so if we go down to the lower time frames, because you can already see that we did have a retest
so the market will always re the market will always uh respect the right, uh support resistance zone, not the fake out
this is how, at least how how i uh see it when i back test it
so you see the market break we try to break above it and create as a new support
but the market didn't have the power to do that, so we did close below
and on the lower time frames, this is always what i talk about
when you see the market try to break one level, you see try to break in, and then you have this huge momentum back inside
and then you see the market retested from below, and then you see the market break down again
so this is what i always, this is how i always calculate fake outs
so when we see fake out, don't use the fake out as a supporter resistant
so sometimes i don't even use because at this point we use the trend line like this, right? we use the trend line like this against these before we see this fake out come picking into the chart
you can see how the market on the lower time frames is doing the same thing
you usually see retest of the trend line, then you see the drop
okay, but this is definitely a good, a good thing to show you
from the trend line, it looks like the market is still continuing down
this is a clear sign that the market will not continue to the upside
because the fake outs is showing you the way, if it's called a fake out, it's called it's supposed to fake you out
it's going to trick you to believe that the market will reverse back up
because in this case, when we're breaking a trendline, resistance trendline, what you want to see is the market break, retest and then continuation
okay? but you know what? i would wait for now when it comes to ethereum, i hope
now, i don't, i want the market to move a little bit more before i actually give out anything
i don't, i don't, i don't like, i don't like use, uh, ethereum now
if you are new to the channel, subscribe to it, because i go through cryptocurrencies every single day
i have morning live streams, so these mornings live stream, i do them monday to friday, eight am, swedish time, every morning
so one hour before london session, i think you know it by now, and we look at the setups just the way we do now
and we're gonna go into the charts, uh, the coins that you want me to look at
we were supposed to have a back testing session yesterday, but i wasn't able to do it, so we're gonna do it tonight at the end of new york session
so we're going to combine a regular new york, new york session where we just go through the charts, but i think the market will be pretty calm
but then we're also going to back test last time on tuesday this week, we were talking about trend lines and how, and you can already see one thousand six hundred people looked at it
and if you didn't already know, you can receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you are supporting me, in bitcoin senses, by doing that
it's only because this is how we are able to sit here every single day with you or me
and by bits is also great, because you can have your positions for a long time with the very low fees
you can only trade a cryptocurrencies on this platform, but that is good, because every everyone here is a cryptocurrency nerd
and don't forget to exactly as svk esv says, don't forget to be part of the community where you have direct contact with me
guys, when i, when you come into the telegram community, out of respect, i don't do oneonones
i just want you to know that if you are a beginner, i i will not help you
from the bottom of that the community chat and youtube is for you guys
we have so many good people on the big chat that will help you
this is my work, and to try to try to contact me privately, i need to say no to that
we're also connecting the dots on your starting on you start on the weekly chart
so if we see that us 30 now is bouncing, because if if you bitcoin and all of the other prices going up and use these going down, if their u30 will also go up
this could be the push back up to potentially thirty four thousand three four hundred and retest the trend line
beast man, can i contact you? so if you're looking at the lower time frames, [Music], we also connect the dots
so remember yesterday i had it like this, because we came back up to a previous resistance at previous report that we did break
i was inside the cell, up the cell yesterday on us 30, but i moved my stop loss slightly below entry, so it took me out
uh, if we have a push back down, we can, we can come back down to around thirty three thousand and ten
we can also come back down and retest this resistance that we did break
you can see the market pull back down to exactly 33 090 before i push back up
so what i did was that i calculated um where the market can pull back down to
if we are not respecting 33 090, we can come back down to 32 890 for a potential retest
okay, if you see the market break the support trendline, also break the previous higher low, in this case at 32 070, that could be the rita's back down
so now when we we got the setups now on us 30 also, so we know what to do when the market comes to these levels, and that is not losing all of your money
and yesterday was so boring, it was raining, and it reminds you that you can be depressed sometimes, but today is lovely
i just, i just, i just want to say to everyone that's on this live stream, and if you're living in a country with a lot of sun, um, you are happy
what do you want me to look at while we have the time? um, let's see
so, oh, this was, no, i don't know when we were looking at 88 the last time, but it definitely our three targets definitely got hit
but what i did was that i took a fibonacci from 06396 back down to the low at nine hundred and 0593 six
so this was a beautiful train that um cardano has an event happening on the 11th
because if we see that the market is coming up to these levels, we know that you can see some rejections
um market came back down, created a support we could also have done this, just so we can understand, on the daily chart, we did break the previous in this little downtrend
how are you drag fibonacci after the break from the support, back up? so this is, we can do it in different ways
and you can see how the market perfectly came back down and retested the fifty percent at zero point
fifty four thousand and three go down to the lower time frames
we could also have take it back up to um, the resist the the top of the resistance
so you could see how the market came back up, retested the fibonacci, and slowly, instead, it went to the upside um
so we're taking that one away because now we understand the concept of it
we are right now also retesting a previous resistance at 06 000
and this is actually where you see the market is just bouncing in between
but we can see that more clear on the lower time frames, because what we also have done now, if we connected the trend line
so while i'm continuing to look at ada, you can tell me in the chat where you're from
and now, so you can tell me where you're from, while i continue to analyze ada, and then we can see
now we're gonna do it like this, [Music], if we're holding ourselves
because what, what, what i also did was that i drag a fib from 6554 back down to the support at 5513
this could be where the the lower high will be created at 6036, potentially 6153
but at the moment, i still need to focus on that we're actually in the consolidation market
we try to break it could be the fake out from the and you see the market drop a little bit more
and you can already see, we can also do this on the one hourly chart with draggy support trendline
if you see that the market breaks this level, rita's from up below, that could be the beginning back down
because remember, fake out, fake out from the resistance, huge volatility to the downside
market comes back up, retest the exact same resistance since before
if we break the support trendline, retest, that is the beginning of the market could potentially come back down again
so this is definitely something that we need to have in mind by just trying to connect the dots
or as you guys already know, you can obviously see the market break it, retest, continuation
so if bitcoin goes up, obviously you will see some other thing
roland isn't are you in london now? uh, lauren is from pleodena, tennessee, mongolia
it sounds like from the hobbits or something, from the lord of the rings
is it true that swedish people don't share their food with their guests? yeah
when i was younger, when i was younger, and if i stayed at people's homes, they never, sometimes they could be like, yeah, i'm gonna go to eat now
and i was like, so what happens to me? like, yeah, i come back soon
i was like, cheap family cannot even give a little child some food
when people come to my place, i give them everything you want, this, that and that
i saw that we did have some other coins that you wanted me to look at before we end this live stream, because i need to go in about 10 minutes
but yeah, this was beautiful because a couple of days ago, aave, and we were up, we did talk about it
so what i did was that i took a fibonacci from last highly low to the next higher high, market came back down to the fibonacci, created a higher high
so you saw, the market came to profit one, uh, fibonacci, 50 percent
so it's very good using a previous support that we did break, because you can see, if we close above it, that could take us back up to the trend line again
and whatever happens is, at that point, i can, i don't know now, but you can already see that you had the market trying to, we had some trouble to break this high
so what we're gonna do is that we connect the dots with the support trendline, because you can see how the market is creating the low, higher low, higher low, a higher high
so now okay, do we come back down to create another higher low for then dancing the push and continuation to the upside? or is it, is this the time when the market is just only come up to this previous support, turn it into a resistance, and then see the market drop even more
you saw the market giving on the four hour chart also, aim for a hanging man
and when you have that against the previous support that you tried to break, we can have our in mind that, okay, this could be the fake out
another thing that we could have done in this case, we dragged the fit from the last high to the low
and what did the market do? if we're taking this one away, market came back down and retested the fibonacci levels
we have it above these highs because we can expect the market to give you some momentum
and especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies, the market is really volatile
so i would also, oh, i always have my, my my stoploss above the previous high and on this fibonac on this fibonacci, all of the three targets got hit
okay, but what do we need to do now? so we're still gonna use the support at the previous support
um, another thing, we drag flip from 115 back down to the support at 104
and you can see that we are right now inside the fibonacci levels go down to the lower time frames
okay, yeah, it just kind of looks like we're going down on aave
could have taken a fibonacci from this high to this low, also this high
can you see how perfectly the kind of already happened? the market is going down
but looking at the hard time frames, yeah, this could definitely happen
okay, so it's, it's not the best people, uh, take profits, but still take profits, you know, if that is the case
so i would not be surprised if you see, at least see the market coming to take profit one at 101, because that is also combined with the support trendline
and we're based on that of the previous support that we did break on the higher time frames
guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that

later today, in a couple of hours, i will also have a live session together with you at the end of new york session, where we're going to go through the charts
and then we are also, ha, we will also have back testing sessions
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
oh yeah, i think there was someone that told me that was a little bit problem with the, with the support trendline with the bonus

um, i know we just might have smoking joe here to mess you if you're here, but not talking
i hope everyone is having a great day today, and i hope that you will have a great weekend
i needed some time off the charts yesterday because it it's sometimes it can screw your mind up
and that is why it's really important for you to take care of yourself first, and then you can take care of all of the other people
you know, everyone, my name is josh, and this bitcoin indicator is telling us another massive move is coming sometime soon for bitcoin
so i'll be talking about that in just a moment, alongside the stock market, which has experienced a slight pullback today, which is why crypto prices have pulled back today as well
and later in this video, i'll be giving you a quick update on this descending triangle pattern that ethereum is still forming, which will be important to pay attention to
and obviously, we still have this active bullish divergence in play
if you want to know more information about this, check out my last video on the channel
and the same can be said about this fractal on the daily time frame for bitcoin, which is still playing out
as you can see in this video that i posted nearly a week ago, the price of bitcoin was sitting at around 28 000
and due to this fractal, we've predicted and moved to the upside, and now a move to the downside
and if this fractal simply continues to play out like what it has been doing over the past one week or so as i've been covering it, then, technically speaking, it does suggest some more downside price action, possibly within the next one week or so, but overall, mostly choppy, sideways price action within the next one month or so, before potentially experiencing a bit more of a bullish recovery
and i want to make it clear that even though this fractal has been very accurate so far, i am not relying on it to be 100 accurate, because that is not a fair expectation
instead, i'm using this fractal as kind of like a guide alongside my other analysis to see if things line up
and you can see why this is the case, especially when you zoom into the four hour chart, looking at the same fractal, you can obviously see that it's not 100 accurate
we don't go to every single touch point along this fractal, but generally speaking, in terms of the down swings and the up swings, this has been pretty accurate so far, which is why i'm still covering it here on the channel
and while we're here on the four hour bitcoin chart, taking a look at this chart right here on the same four hour time frame, and just giving you a really quick recap
first of all, we had this bearish divergence, which resulted in more bearish price action
and then we found support along the golden pocket, if you're bringing out the fibonacci retracement tool, from this swing low at around 28 000 to the swing high at around 324 k
and then we came back up towards this line of resistance that i told you about yesterday, coming in at around 30 700
and over the past one day, we've obviously gotten a rejection from that line of resistance back down to this level of support at the golden pocket, which is sitting at around 29 and a half thousand
but if we see a confirmed break below 29 and a half thousand with something like a four hour candle close, then in that case, i would expect a drop down towards this level of support, the green line
in fact, i'll just take away the fibonacci levels, as this line of support is coming into play at around 28 and a half thousand
if we confirm a break below 29 and a half thousand, and if the price of bitcoin does end up coming back down towards around 28 and a half thousand, we could potentially see the fourhour bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories, because it is getting closer
and now zooming out to the daily bitcoin charts, looking at the bollinger bands indicator, which is still in this squeeze formation, which is revealing another massive move coming sometime soon
and if you've been keeping up to date with my videos over the past one week or so, you'll know that i covered this indicator right around here when we did initially enter into this massive squeeze
and just around the corner, within the next one to two days, we saw quite a volatile movement in the bitcoin price
but this wasn't the full extent of the volatile move because we're still seeing a massive squeeze in this bollinger bands
we did not completely release out of this squeeze, like this, for example
and as for the potential size of the next volatile move, according to the squeeze that we're seeing in the bollinger bands at the moment, i would expect the bitcoin price to reach somewhere in the mid 30 000 prices, at around 35 000 approximately, or the mid 20 000 prices, around 25k approximately, potentially revisiting that original low, which, according to that fractal that i just covered, could be the more likely scenario
but at the end of the day, it comes down to whether or not we break resistance or support, which is why it's important to pay attention to these two levels that i just mentioned earlier
and over the past few days, in the stock market, we have been seeing a lot of choppy, sideways price action
we've seen a bit of a selloff in the stock markets, which is likely one of the main reasons why we have seen a bit of a pullback today in crypto
but for those of you who missed my last video on the channel, definitely check that one out, because i talked about the potential scenario of the stock market having a bit of a relief rally, similar to what we saw during march
and in that case, we could see a bit of a relief rally in crypto
but once again, this is why we need to keep an eye on what the stock market is doing, and that is why i include updates on the stock market every day the stock market is trading in these videos
and now, heading into the ethereum part of this video, this right here is the daily ethereum to us dollar chart
and obviously, we still have this active bullish divergence in play
and right now, at the time of recording in this video, the price of ethereum here on the daily time frame, does have the potential to extend this bullish divergence, which could be done by forming a slightly lower low in the price action, while maintaining a higher low structure in the daily rsi
because right now the daily rsi is well and truly in higher lows, while the price action is pretty close to that previous low in terms of the daily candle closes
and something else that is important to mention is the fact that right now, we're seeing something very similar to what we saw in the last significance of bullish divergency on the daily time frame for ethereum
because back here in these previous bullish divergence that we formed in february and march, after we had already confirmed that bullish divergence with a lower low in the price action and a higher low in the rsi, we saw a decent shortterm bounce in the price of ethereum straight after that bullish divergence
and then we came back down, almost back down towards that second low
and at that stage, it looks like we could potentially extend these bullish diversions by forming a slightly lower low in the price action, because we were getting close to that previous low, while the rsi, on the other hand, was well and truly in higher lows
which, once again, is very similar to what we're seeing at the moment, which is something to at least consider
but when you're taking a look at the shorter term price action here on the six hour ethereum charts, over the past one day, obviously, the price of ethereum has had a little bit lower closer towards these previous lows, which is sitting at around seventeen hundred dollars per ethereum
and what i said in my last video is the fact that ethereum here on the six hour time frame, is technically forming this descending triangle pattern
but if we form a higher low, then that would essentially invalidate this descending triangle pattern
because a descending triangle is meant to have horizontal lows
so if the price of ethereum does make its way down closer towards 1700, even if it's a little bit off at around 1710 or 1720, for example, that's basically what we'll need to see in order to further confirm the fact that ethereum is forming this descending triangle pattern
because, once again, a higher low structure is not a descending triangle pattern
but either way, we still have this line of resistance to pay attention to, which has been confirmed multiple times as strong resistance
but if you zoom all the way out to the weekly ethereum chance, looking at the weekly ethereum rsi, we are incredibly close to oversold territories, which has only ever happened just one time in ethereum's entire price history, which was at the bottom of the 2018 bear market
now i want to make it clear that we are not in oversold territories just yet, but we are getting very close
and in fact, the end of the 2018 bear markets was the only time in ethereum's history where the rsi has now been lower than what we're sitting at right now
even during the march 2020 crash, the rsi on the weekly frame did not go as low as we're sitting at right now
so if we do end up going a little bit lower into oversold territories, that is an extremely rare opportunity that we have only seen just one other time
but right now, according to ethereum's history, relatively speaking, we're already at some very cheap levels according to the weekly rsi
but there is a little bit more room to the downside, technically speaking
and just to give you a quick update on the ethereum short positions on the bitfenix exchange here on the weekly timeframe
and you can clearly see right here that over the past few weeks, we've seen a lot of ethereum whales close their short positions
and if you're turning to take a look at the past, these traders on this exchange, at least, have been very accurate at closing their short positions
because if you're looking at the first example right here, showing a lot of ethereum short positions closing on the bitfenix exchange, that was happening mostly during september 2020, just before the price of bitcoin and ethereum both skyrocketed
and looking at the next time, where we saw a massive amount of ethereum short positions closed here on the bifinix exchange, that's happened during the second half of may, entering into june last year, which was at the bottom of a massive crash that we saw during the first half of may in particular
and not long after we saw a massive amount of ethereum short positions closed on the bifidex exchange
within about one to two months later, we saw a massive pump in both the price of bitcoin and the price of ethereum
so seeing this happen again after we have already experienced a lot of bearish price action, is very interesting, especially combined with the fact that the weekly ethereum rsi is very close to oversold territories this is also something to consider moving forward, the fact that a lot of whales are moving out of their ethereum short positions on the bitfenix exchange, which have historically been very accurate
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum versus bitcoin chart here on the daily time frame
and like i said yesterday, we do have a potential bullish divergence forming right here
but this has not been confirmed at the time of recording this video
because first of all, what we need to see is this daily kennel close as a lower low compared to this previous low
and then after that potentially happens, we'll then need to see at least one green daily candle in order to confirm a higher low in the rsi
and if that plays out, then that would confirm this bullish divergence here on the daily time frame for ethereum versus bitcoin, which would be good news for ethereum holders, at least in the shorter term, and potentially good news for old coin holders as well
because usually if your investor's bitcoin is a pretty good indicator for what a lot of the old queen market is going to do
because this goes hand in hand with the bitcoin dominance chart, which conversely, is forming a bearish divergence right now
but with that being said, as i mentioned yesterday, when it comes to this bearish divergence of the bitcoin dominance, chance it could take a while to play out
because in the past, looking at other bearish divergences, for example, what we saw during february this year, we saw this entire bearish divergence forming over the month of february, which took basically an entire month in order to actually play out
so once again, even though we are seeing a bearish divergence form right now in the bitcoin dominance here on the daily time frame, this could take a while, potentially a few weeks or so, in order to actually play out
and then we could see a bit of a relief in the old queen markets compared to bitcoin
but overall, in terms of the trend, obviously i'm more bullish for bitcoin than old coins at the moment
as i've been repeating over and over again here on the channel, i've been saying i'm incredibly light on alt coins
and when it comes to my personal investing strategy, at the moment, i am dollar cost averaging into bitcoin and ethereum, but much heavier into bitcoin than ethereum

i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
uh, i guess it did have a decent bounce early on this week, yesterday's red looks like it's slowing down, and there are a couple of green candles across the board
but is this bounce going to sustain? how high could it go? well, that's what we're going to have a look at today
so, and i'm also going to update you on yesterday's trades, for those of you that did manage to get into them
first and foremost, i'm going to start on the high time frame chart, just to get a little bit of perspective, see what the the situation is over here with the wicks
i am still eyeing that out as an important liquidity area to me, personally
it's just a matter of when we get to that level, not if i think, over time we will get there
whether this is confirmed as a local bottom for now, and it takes the next couple of months, that's, that's a different scenario
so at the moment, if this green candle manages to close above the previous two weeks, uh, red candles, then a weekly close like that will look quite bullish, at least for continuation back towards the 21 ema on a weekly scale
and then i would anticipate a most likely rejection off of that zone and then come back down for that area
and remember, when you look at a weekly scale, these type of charts can play out over months, guys
the histogram over here has one slight tick towards the upside, which is a good thing
you would want to see this this to slowly decrease and then move towards the green side if you're looking for a local, confirmed bottom and some sort of a reversal
i did say that i would still anticipate that any sort of a bounce that comes within this area is going to sit in the next lower high, and there would be continuation back towards the downside
so this zone on the lefthand side over here is where those precovered levels are
uh, expecting just shortterm bounces, relief, rallies, if you will
while this chart over here, we do know that it is, the vertical line represents not only the next bare moon, we'll see how this one plays out
and then you also have this liquidity zone over here, where price is coming back to test that area that was previous support as resistance
and then, of course, combined with the quantitative tightening, which began as of yesterday
so a lot of negative news, but that's why we're doing shortterm trades
if you do want to join sheldon and i, uh, on the journey, then just have a look over here
if you have a look over here, underneath the youtube video, in the description, you'll find my social medias
and then you can click the buy but link if you want to copy trade us, i guess, or follow us on the journey
and that's why we're taking shortterm trades, because the macro doesn't look good in the long term
and the funding rates went negative, much more negative comparison to the previous negative rates that we had
and what you'll find that means that more people have been taking on shorts
and that's why i'm leaning towards also a shortterm relief bounce
and touching on this chart over here, this was the tron shorts
it is going to be in the newsletter as well, so make sure you subscribe to that
i'm looking at most of the market to take a short term relief pump, and then probably get rejected off important key zones and come back down again
i said, you take 50 off of the table over there, and what would i be doing now? so currently still holding the other 50, sticking to the trade plan, but we lowered the stop loss down from at the top, down to this level over here
if this bounce carries on into the yellow zone, which is 008731, i would reenter that initial 50 profit back into that zone, shorted straight back into that level
again, take profit, and then stick to the rest of the plan, hoping to take profit in liquidity zone two and then liquidity zone three to close off the rest of the trade
if that fails, and price loses this diagonal and loses the liquidity zone, intake profit level one, then i'll just stick to the plan and just take your next profit, 30 off the table there, and then close the rest at the bottom
looking at roon on a slightly high time frame, i gave a 15 minute chart with the previous call that i had
you can see that it was in this down, uh, parallel down channel over here, broke up to the upside
i said, if you lose the key horizontal zone, which is over here, let's just grab a brush over here
so i said, if you lose this key horizontal zone, that would be confirmation of a bearish continuation
now i'd watch for possible retests into that area, and then same thing, you could probably short straight back down
so what does that look like on a low time frame? well, if we look on the 15minute chart, this is essentially what we have
initially, you would have entered into the short position in this zone over here
i said, enter on the break of that line, where you see the circle
i said, if you break that line, then the short will accelerate very quickly into the liquidity zone
and now you can see, okay, well, look, you would have been stopped out
so i've done this chart for the newsletter as well before the show
and the reason for the stop would be you have a long term trend line that's going down, which means it could be following this plan, right? so on a high time frame, we're pushing back up towards this zone
and now i can recreate this chart and say, at a later stage, maybe we'll be preparing for the next short within that area, which is coming in at about three dollars and five cents
but have a look on my twitter, because that's where i'm going to give you the proper outline of that information
and then i really wanted to touch on solana very quickly, because solana, i saw, was shut down or something for like four hours yesterday
um, again, they say that the chain is has a lot of problems where it's constantly offline, uh, which is not obviously good for cryptocurrency
but you had this main area, i said it was trading within the range
so top of the range, bottom of the range, in the bottom of the gray zone, you have that declining, uh, trend line over there, which is tracking price down
and the last line of support here is your weak low, which i would anticipate would not hold
so in summary, for solana, i would say, solana could be in some serious trouble
uh? it's interesting always how the charts show you these things and then the fundamentals of follow on, like basically them being offline for five hours
so the next liquidity zone, i would think solana could potentially come anywhere as low as 19 and 77
so i know that's hard to believe, especially if you're a solana holder, but bear in mind that the initial investors at the seed round got in at four cents for solano
imagine how much they still up, something like a hundred and sixty seven thousand percent, despite the selloff that it's had
and the top of the liquidity zone is going to be around 26 dollars
especially once you break and you lose this wick area, once you lose this zone over here, i would think that this will just freefall straight into that zone over there

how is everyone doing? hope you are having all a fantastic day today
and we are going to analyze the situation here for bitcoin, of course
we're gonna take a look at something that we have been talking about, you know, for the last, you know, two, three, it was even four days, you know, this possible scenario, this possible fractal that did happen on december of 2021, happening here
we didn't actually get a balance from this major level over here, the thirty thousand five hundred dollars, as you can see, we're expecting i was expecting a balance at this level we've been talking about
okay, we can jump in here on the buy bit chart here that i do have with the volume profile
so why didn't this level hold? well, i did have some questions in the telegram group from somebody, you know, you said that we were going to get a pound from 30 000, 500
and, you know, we just need to take a look at, you know, the high probabilities and what i mostly want to expect from the price action to decide if i'm going to take a trade or not
remember, yesterday on the live stream, and i just took it just before the live stream
it would have been nice to do that live short trade that i actually hold still 40 percent of the trade here on buybit
okay, still 40 from this trade that i did take here, just slightly below the 31 800
okay, there was a diamond pattern here, as told by someone in the community
i did not actually, you know, eye this diamond pattern, but, um, very interesting
you know, i was looking for that third attempt to fail and i was happy to start taking that trade over here
and of course, if you do have that leg up and actually close below this high over here, even better
okay? this was a little bit of a risky trade that i did take, all right, with a stop loss, you know, quite a few dollars on top of this last wick
why do you have a take profit one if you do think that this level is going to have a big, massive bounce? because what if we do not get the balance? what if we do not take, you know, what if we do not have that reaction at this level? and this is why, the reason, you know, of having to take profit one at a big, major support level, right? it's just very much explained, i try and explain, uh, you know, as best as i can, you know, the take profit one, you know, why would you have a take profit one? why don't you take all of your profits if you think this is gonna bounce? well, you know, like like i just said, you know, probably it might not hold, and you are gonna, you know, slice straight through this range
remember guys, remember the last couple of days we were talking about this scenario, okay? we were talking about, you know, this kind of fractal where we're going to get liquidity, you know, at this range, all right, at this lower high and get a bunch of liquidity
and, you know, my idea of this was, you know, it's very likely gonna get rejected
but if you guys been following the live streams, if you guys have been following the videos, did i take a trade here? did i take a trade? right over here? this is, let me just go to the two hourly here
uh, did i take a trade here? did i take a trade here? i did not take a trade
why didn't i take a trade? because i was talking about this potential scenario of getting rejected from this zone and continuing to the downside
why didn't i take the trade? if you are talking about this possible scenario, because i need to see a reaction at this level
i need to see the price action failing to attempt to break this resistance
as soon as i see the price action failing to break the resistance, i am going to jump in the trade right over here
after this consolidation, we had a nice value area high created here, as you can see, you know, just waiting patiently to see multiple attempts to finally decide and jump in a trade
but why didn't i enter a long position at this level if i did know that this was supposedly a very strong range, looking for that potential bounce? we can see december 2021, you know, very similar experience, right there
big resistance level, retesting the low, coming back down and actually having a big, massive bounce
but, um, you know, we did have on the four hourly, you know, you can zoom in on the two hourly chart
the two hourly chart is the one that i'm actually analyzing here on on, on by bit
let me just go back here to december to see this kind of price action
and what happened yesterday is that we did not have that reaction
so i if we would have had a reaction at this range for a few hours, i would have probably would have considered too long this level
and this is why, always on my videos, you will see me talk about major levels
and i will only take a trade if we do see a large consolidation, if we see the balls are the bears failing to attempt to break this major level, then is when i am going to jump in a trade
so let me just go here, quickly, through the comment section, just a quick explanation on this, guys
because on my latest videos, you know, the deal, we were talking about the levels
we were talking about these levels, these levels, you know, could we get that bounce here? and then potentially another attempt and create a double top or a lower high, yes, of course
but, you know, you you can see i only took, you know, these last two trades the last week
there was one over here that i did take also, but one over here for this long position, looking for that stop all the way up here that played out beautifully
and looking for that short position here to potentially go to this level and potentially even go to lower levels
so, of course, this would have been a good trading opportunity, but only if we would have had a consolidation, guys
so i just wanted to clear that out for the community, of course
you know, why is your stop loss here? and, yeah, make the most of it, guys, because you watching here need to learn, and you need to become professional traders to have another source of income, right? which is the whole idea of trading
if i do get someone in the comment section, can you take a look at smp500? what do you think? you know? uh
i got someone in the comment section saying, can you analyze gold? and as soon as i analyze gold, i pretty, like, i really liked this kind of structure of higher lows, pretty nice, healthy uptrend
all right, since, you know, the 21st, sorry, since, uh, january, february, you know, since 2021, since we created this low over here in in march, sorry, this is march of 2021
and also, we have a pretty nice, beautiful bat pattern right over here that looks pretty cool
this back pattern should have, you know, that leg up in gold to 1920 the ounce
and as soon as we were analyzing this yesterday, i jumped on a trade on prime xbt, thanks to someone
okay, in in in the comment section, you know, talking about gold
and i think, you know, this could be a potential swing trade, because we do have a bat pattern right over here, which looks pretty, pretty good, you know, hitting that point 88 with a little bit of volatility, holding this support the trend line
you know, this is very likely gonna hold and get that leg up to this range, which would be my potential target, the six, one, eight, from c to d point
looking for that potential, you know, consolidation, take profit area, absolutely
uh, we could probably hit that 1 920 an ounce in the next coming days
you know, this is, i'm looking for a week around about one, two weeks approximately
anyway, just something i wanted to point out, you know, just going through the last live stream, i like to do five, ten minutes looking at bitcoin, looking at some different, you know, assets, um, that i've actually taken a trade off for because of someone in the community
and guys, before i continue, i need you to absolutely smash up the like button if you enjoy this content
makes me want to do videos every single day and live streams every single day
okay, so let's just stop the analysis that i have, you know, the explanation that i give you from my, you know, things that i'm trading, and let's jump straight away in the comment section and say hello
are you talking about this? uh, immediate short term pump or yeah
i mean, this is, you could arguably discuss that this was a bull trap
how many people, i'm going to turn the ac off because i'm freezing here
um, how many people on youtube? i mean, it was, i i, i don't want to talk about, you know, people because it's not fair on them, of course
um, but yeah, i did see quite a few youtubers, right, analysts, whatever, you know, being extremely bullish at these levels
you know, some of them even longing at this range okay? and it was just like, stay cautious because, you know, look at, i mean, the similarities that we were talking about at this range
you know, this was a huge, huge level of 32 000 long in here, is was absolutely suicidal
but you could see that bullish sentiment, you know, the last few days when we were having that price action, you know, breaking thirty thousand, thirty one thousand, thirty two thousand dollars, and, and, yeah, what happened? we had a massive, big correction, guys, that we were absolutely anticipating
my question is, my question is, i think i did ask this question also yesterday
check out this kind of price action that we've been talking about
what happens next is that we do get a bounce from this resistance, as you can see, turning into support
um, you know, it's not the exact same, uh, price action, because this price action over here, we should be, we should be trading around about the 28 600
basically, do you think you know, this fractal that we have been talking about the last few days is going to play out to the downside in the coming weeks
will we get a large consolidation here at the 30 000 range, all right, for the next coming days, and potentially continue back down to retest the 25k levels? and i'm going to keep it pretty simple here on the poll
it's already, it's really good to see, you know, the the what people think about this
so my question is, are we testing the 25 k levels in the coming weeks? guys? let me know in the poll right now
okay, are we going to retest? because if we were to follow this kind of fractal situation, we would have to have a consolidation at this range and then potentially drop down to retest
we we should, we should be taking a look at the most important levels
funny fact here, that the price of bitcoin dropped to the exact strongest point of control that was created for the last, you know, 20, 25 days, 25 days, trading volume profile, biggest point of control was exactly around about the 29 range
we actually got that about from this level, which was pretty insane
you know, this is why sometimes point of control volume profile value very high lows
my trading is based a lot on on on this major, on these major levels
okay, so anyway, let's scroll down here through the comment section
are we testing the 25k levels in the coming weeks? 83 percent of people are saying yes
um, andy, what about solano? says, natalie, what? natalie wizard
what's going on with salon? um, [Music], me just zoom in here
because on the daily, i do think that solana will enter a large consolidation in between twenty dollars and forty dollars
these this major consolidation level on solana, i think this would be the bear market low
um, for the coming weeks, it will enter a large consolidation, in my personal opinion, uh, if, you know, if bitcoin does go to 25k, 22k, then this one, the lows would be 20 dollars, 25 for solana
in my personal opinion, it might be very, very boring price action for the next coming months
okay, the the people to gain confidence right now with the current world situation, the market situation, everybody, you know, is, is, is in doubt, you know, of what could happen
so to gain confidence in the cryptocurrency market, it's going to take, um, several months
but it's going to take many, many months where it's very likely going to enter a large consolidation, accumulation, kind of, um, you know, kind of, uh, pattern, right? um, because the reason, and this is where most of the institutions are going to start buying in, okay? they buy in, they pump the price, they dump the price, and they accumulate at the lowest levels that they can
is going to be one of those, you know, projects that will survive, in my personal opinion
so anyway, you probably want to know shortterm analysis on solana
and basically what is happening right now is that we are retesting, you know, this low zone
it's very well we haven't retested the 35 dollars, and this is very, very possible
uh, some analysis that we were talking about on solana was, you know, getting this rejection from this level
we had a, we kind of formed a descending triangle right over here, right where we broke down and came back up and retested, you know, beautifully
um, it was definitely a resistance you have the lower highs from these, uh, this lower high trend line, as you can see on the four hourly chart
you have a big, major, solid support level right over here that you break down, you come back up, and you finally get rejected
and by the looks of things, we are just about to lose this low over here at the 40 range, which is consolidating here a little bit
not a successful breakout yet, but, you know, the probabilities in solana coming back down and retesting the 35 low over the 12th of may is very, very high at this point
of course, we're only five dollars away, uh, if we do retest this low and start making some crazy price action with a couple of wicks and a couple of consolidations, you know, we need to eye what is going to happen as soon as we hit the 35
and, you know, i am going to actually put an alarm here on on um, on trading view, of course, so i can get that message, you know, create an alarm just if we do hit that 35, because we could create that swing failure pattern, create that double bottom scenario to look for higher levels
then i would be confident to say, right short term, we are potentially going to create double bottom heat on solana
but so far, what i could say on solana, you know, if bitcoin is going to continue this kind of bearish price action that is having right now, this consolidation, and retesting 25, you know, basically it's, it's, uh, inevitable that solana is going to retest the 35 and even, you know, which down to 30
if we do see that bearish price action on bitcoin, to come down to 26, 25 000
whatever bitcoin does, you know all coins will follow, and even stronger
if that moves down five percent, then, yeah, some all coins will move 10, 15, 20, you name it
almost 200 votes on the poll, and we see, are we testing the 25k levels, uh, in the next coming weeks? and 78 percent of people say yes
i mean, when you see this in the chart, you know something was going on here on waves in between, you know, february and may you know, just in a matter of two, three months, you do have this insane price action when it where it goes from eight, nine dollars all the way up here, having a 650 pump in in the middle of the bear market, you know, breaking alltime highs
you know, stay cautious with these kind of projects, because, you know, there's, there is some, some inside movements on, on, on, on, crypto's projects that make this kind of price action
i have absolutely no idea why this happened, but, yeah, it's having pretty nice volatility waves
and just to be pretty clear, we are at a very large level right now where we are hitting the strongest vpvr level
okay? let me just yeah, from the volume traded for the last, you know, five, six months, we can see december right over here, of 2021, the biggest level right now we are crashing
okay? we are hitting a major consolidation from end of january and the entire month of february, basically right now, on waves, hitting that big spike on the vpvr
so, yes, what happened here, very likely, looking at the four hourly, is that we created, you know, a kind of a, you could say a descending channel, uh, descending channel right over here with with bullish divergence, i bet you know, i don't even need to take a look at that
but very likely, when you have a major drop like this, and you slightly drop like this, it is very likely to get some some pumpy action at some point
these are are one of the best trades, where you have a big, aggressive drop, and then price action slightly creates lower lows
and this is, you know, the same to the upside, if you have a massive, big pump, and you start creating slightly higher, uh, higher highs
you know, this is a kind of a distribution pattern right there
so, um, basically, right now on on waves, we are hitting this straw, a big, strong level on on the volume profile, in my take here, zooming in on the four hourly
you know, if you think to yourself, where could i take fibonacci levels from this high, from this high? well, this big, major drop, you know, you could arguably discuss it starts from this level, and that would be a good fib level to take a look at
and we're basically, you know, about 10, almost touching the six, one, eight
we've already got rejected once here, getting that consolidation before
if it reaches the 12 range, then, yeah, and gets a little bit of consolidation
it's very, very likely gonna get rejected and continue to the downside
i mean, the insane, the pump has been absolutely insane, no doubt about that
but, yeah, i think, you know, this is very likely going to continue down, uh, at least to retest the the low zone
i know it's a very, it's a great project, but, yeah, i think it's, it will enter a large consolidation, in my personal opinion, after this volatile, huge volatility
i mean, i've heard all sorts on xrp, and it only did about a 10x in the ball run
it's been, i mean, i room, i have so many, um, you know, i would i wouldn't say friends and people that i know that were absolutely xrp maniacs, okay? and, um, putting a huge amount of their money into xrp
and it's been such a bad performer in the ball run, i am not going to buy xrp if i want to make huge gains
i asked you about the diamond pattern yesterday, and now i think i'm spotting, uh, evening star on the daily
what do you think? a ko power absolutely phenomenal with a diamond pattern
it wasn't the most beautiful, but it played out pretty, pretty nicely at the end because, um, we had, like i said, most importantly for a diamond pattern is to have that big volume spike in the middle
the volume spike in the middle of the pattern is is what you want to see
and you want to see very low volume at the edges of the diamond pattern
so that was pretty much kind of, you know, this is just volatility right there
it was pretty much valid for this diamond pat time and pattern scenario
i mean, you talking about today? well, of course, we would have to close today
evening star, so we could not confirm if you are referring to today
i guess you're talking about this slice through, because we have been talking about this major level, guys
and, you know, it would have been nice to see at least a few hours
you want to see those consolidations before you actually, you know, take the decision
the consolidations are, you know, it are to decide, you know, trying to catch a falling knife here
you nee, you you want to, you know, when i enter trades, it's up consolidations
i saw all my ex i sold all my xrp and put it into our elf one month ago
why not? you know, because if i see someone in the community saying, you know, i sold all of this to put all of it all into here
as long it's not, is it? it is not a meme coin, i will take a look at it
you know? why not? uh, i made huge gains on, on, on metis because someone talked about it
you know, the the med is that i did buy back in, uh, when it was around about 25, um, sorry, 45, round about the 43, 45 dollar mark, i bought my metis
the the 50 meters that i did buy at 45 43 is um, you get a basically 50 down
um, layer two for the ethereum network, and it's got gotten absolutely crushed
but i remember somebody in the comment section talking about meters
you know, check out mentis l2 for ethereum and and there's room for a bunch of l2s
uh, i liked the team and made huge gains on buying matters, thanks to someone in the comment section
obviously, me afterwards, doing my research, and i looked, you know, i was pretty happy to invest some of my capital into metas
um, now it's going to enter a sideways accent, you know, bear market, sidewalls, action accumulation zone
i think it will enter one two years accumulation zone, potentially, maybe not as much
so, um, of course, there is room for a lot of projects such as, you know, avax cadena, but ethereum will remain number one, in my personal opinion
and there will be very important in the next coming years, l2s um
so i think, you know, investing in l2s is is a good, is a good move for the coming years
this is the thing, when you have this fishy price action, you know, i would be very cautious
maybe this one in the future will do well, but when i see a project making this kind of price action, you know, um, this doesn't give me any any confidence at all in such a short period of time
over five years, waves has has been existing for anyway, let's scroll down here through the comment section
what i do have here on ethereum? and i guess we do not need to analyze, uh, take a look at the daily because we are at the most important level here, which, well, we did bounce from the most important level, which is the summer 2021 lows round about the 1 700
will this level hold in the coming weeks? well, if bitcoin does drop down to the 25 000 range and have that volatility, ethereum very likely will lose the 1 700 area
and one of the latest things that we must have taken a look, uh, at from ethereum is this over here
you know, this is the only thing that i have on ethereum, right over here
i mean, we must should have done some analysis yesterday on ethereum
and what we have here, you know, similar, similar on what bitcoin did, but not the same, not really the same, because bitcoin actually came all the way here to retest the lower highs from the 12th of may, 13th of may
ethereum should have, should have done this kind of price action, just like bitcoin, to retest the highs, right? this is aetherium, if you take a look
and bitcoin, you know, bitcoin did actually come all the way up here to retest the last lower high from the 11th of may, uh, 11th of may and 12th of may, as you can see here
so, why didn't ethereum follow bitcoin? why didn't an ethereum have that price action to the upside? reason number one, i would say, is the bitcoin dominance
okay, just a quick explanation on just, you know, maybe some people have that question
you know, bitcoin dominance is actually having, you know, some pretty nice price momentum to the upside, some pretty nice price action to the upside
so if bitcoin dominance does go up, all right, while the bitcoin price does go up, you are going to see a lot of altcoins stuck
you're just going to see them stuck because basically a lot of the money from the altcoins are flooding into bitcoin
and that is that if the bitcoin dominance does go up and the bitcoin price does go down, then all coins will go down even further
because, apart from the market sentiment going down, you're having the all coins, you know, money from the old coins, capital volume from the old coins, pouring into bitcoin while the market is going so that is, this is also, you know, gonna go, uh, you know, bitcoin goes goes down, the all coins are going to go even much lower
so bitcoin dominance is always good to take a look at to see the kind of, you know, movements of the altcoins, you know, in between bitcoin and bitcoin dominance
what we did take a look at, let's keep our eyes on ethereum, we had this trend line from these lower highs
this is what i had on the chart, getting that rejection, getting this consolidation, hitting the biggest point of control, not managing to successfully break above this range
uh, in my personal opinion, of course, this is a moment to be bearish, especially, you know, this was on the 31st of may, 31st and 1st of may
where was bitcoin on the 31st and 1st of, uh, of june? sorry, not may
so just by, you know, analyzing bitcoin and my, you know, 70 percent, uh, i was 70 confident that this was gonna actually get rejected
you guys know this, if you are an old subscriber, you have been taking a look at this, you know, for the last few days
i was looking, you know, when i longed here, i was saying, i'm bullish here
um, you can check those videos, all right, from the 28th of may till today
and if if bitcoin is bearish here, if i'm bearish on bitcoin here
and then i go to analyze ethereum, and i see ethereum is here on the 31st of may and first of june
we are at the biggest point of control from the volume traded for the last 20, 25 days
it, yeah, you just need to be bearish, you know, right? you need to be better
you know, it's very, very likely you are gonna get that drop down
if, if i'm looking at bitcoin right now, if bitcoin does have continuation to the downside, you know, we are potentially going to have a third retest here on, on, on, ethereum
ethereum is very likely going to retest the 1 700, potentially in the next coming days, maybe hours, maybe, maybe a few days
could this also be, you know, an inverted copping handle? i would say, i would say no, because this handle is is going well over 50 percent
but anyway, this cup in hand, inverse cup inverters cup and handle, you know, is is very likely going to have that third retest out the 1 700
um, andy, do you think the cme futures gap 10k on bitcoin will ever get filled? that is a very, very good question, george
there are some analysts that are call, is calling, you know, bitcoin that can go down as low as 9k, 10k levels
i'm not to say, i'm not going to, you know, as a trader, as a man, traders mentality you need to have, you need to see the possibilities of bitcoin going down there
you know, if you, if you want to take a look at basic technical analysis, you know, and, um, just go with the fact of this bear flag target
and you could arguably discuss that this is a bear flag out of this massive, big drop that we did have from november till the 30th of january here, right to the 29th, approximately
basically, from november to january, you had this aggressive drop
and, you know, the sometimes basic technical analysis, you might be surprised, but you do, you know, it does play out pretty nicely
i'm looking for day trades and small swing trades, trades that can last for a few days or a couple of weeks, maximum
you know, i've never managed to hold a trade for over a month
i'm a small or day trade, not scalping, and not long swing trading
since we did manage to break the support, you know, this was a level where i was starting to become embarrassed quite a lot
i was thinking that, you we might get this balance from this level
but as soon as we did break down, and the width of the channel, the width of a channel, especially of a multimonthly channel here, you know, going from january all the way to may, the beginning of may is when we started, sorry, yeah, the beginning of may is when we started dropping here, the width of the channel could be the potential target from the breakout
and, you know, we actually came all the way down to this, you know, textbook potential projected move target
and the textbook target from a bear flag is getting the poll right? i mean, this is just basic technical analysis
all right? you you need to add much more things as confluence
but, you know, this would be like the the bear flag, um, you know, target
okay? you get the the actual move, okay? uh, from the the top to the ent, into the into the bear flag, and you put, from the breakout, you put the highest point to the resistance of the flag, which would be here
and, you know, this one right over here is taking you down to the thirteen thousand dollars
so if there is a cme gap round about the ten thousand dollar range, then, you know, as we go with that low, you know, you what, anything could happen
you know, if i do zoom out here on on the threeday chart, zoom out a little bit, you know, we do have the largest point of control at those levels
and i've explained with many other charts also, guys, when price action moves very fast to the upside, you don't leave, you don't leave a track of of big volume
it's just a big, massive hype driving the price up to see if it's going to be sustainable
is this price of bitcoin going to be sustainable at these levels? and if it isn't, as soon as we start losing strong levels
and on the vpvr, i do explain how this 30 000 range is the strongest level on the vpvr, you know
and anyway, what i wanted to show you here is that the strongest range on the vpvr is at the 12 000 range
so, i mean, if bitcoin does come down to this level, it's gonna be such a golden opportunity
it's gonna take, um, days, or just weeks at the most, down at these levels
we have so much money, and most of the volume traded in between 2018 and 2020, 2021
so round about three years, you know, has been range trading in between these levels
so anyway, what i wanted to show you here with the vpvr that we don't have much, much levels here
if this is why we're having this consolidation, this is why we are consolidating at this level, because it's been a huge support back in 2021, we have a massive value area low on the vpvr
if we start losing this level, it's not going to be looking good for bitcoin, the price action from 20 000
there's no doubt in my mind that bitcoin will stop round about the nineteen thousand dollar range if it loses thirty thousand dollars, uh, if um, if we do lose it, because we went so fast all the way up here, from ten thousand dollars all the way up to thirty thousand, even forty one thousand dollars, you know, it happened
the you know, you come so fast up to this range, you can come as fast down to those levels
can the ten thousand dollar gap be filled? it can be, you know, it can be
um, andy, please, your thoughts on avax? short term, says, dreamer
what my shortterm thoughts on avax? i mean, i think avax is a pretty cool, um, l1 project
it's just another one out of the the dozens that the ones that they are there
short term, what can i say? what can i say? you know, short term analysis that we do have here, uh, as you can see, you know, this is the two hourly chart, we've got a beautiful rejection from this level right over here, continued back down, you know, hitting the 50 percent, approximately, fibonacci levels from this high to the low, 618, actually, 6182, perfection right over here
i mean, shortterm opinion, i think avax could potentially, could potentially enter a large consolidation at this level
but shortterm view, shortterm view on on avax, going back to the four hourly, let me just, you know, just for entertainment purposes, let's take a look at the rsi right away
it is creating some, you know, pretty nice bullish divergence, where we are creating lower lows, high lows on the rsi
could we attempt to break the lows here and get a big bounce? absolutely
i do think that we, you know, you could create that kind of swing failure pattern
if you do lose this low and start consolidating at this range, it's very likely going to get a big bounce on
i know a lot of people do think, you know, if we break support, um, if we break support, of obviously, you know, we're going to much lower levels
but if you slightly break support and consolidate, you are very likely going to create a big, massive bounce
um, so, yeah, i would be eyeing the consolidation here on avax, because you might be getting a bounce from that 20, um, 2019 range
sometimes the live streams get a little bit crazy because we just take a look at, like, you know, a lot of all coins, and, you know, just a quick analysis, i really want to go through the comment section, but this is, you know, just, you know, a little bit of an overview on the altcoins
of course, the proper analysis, the proper thing that i do on my videos is focused on bitcoin, guys
i might get an altcoin and do a little bit of more analysis, but you know that i basically focus on bitcoin
so anyway, um, we can jump into bitcoin to see what is going on
also, most importantly, guys, we can take a look at bitcoin to see what is going on
um, so, yeah, uh, wanna be a mod? can i pass my resume? i mean, moderators are created if you are joining the live streams a lot, if you are giving support to the channel, if you are going to be here for several weeks or even months, and you do and you are here consistently and you give support, of course, then you might become a moderator
i'll tell you what, maybe tracy wilson will become a moderator before you
who knows? who knows? i i can see tracy has been here for quite some time, so anyway, who knows? uh, your strategy and expertisement is, uh, impressive
it was insane, the amount of volatility that we were having here, all the way up, you know, massive, big pump the dump
and as soon as we created this, i was staying away from this crypto
you just need one, two assets, of course, to to make huge gains at the end of the month
and, uh, these all coins sometimes are just extremely, extremely risky
but if you want to know, you know, my overview on the on on this altcoin, i know a lot of people, i mean, this is just coming down to to um 2019, 2020 levels
it's coming all the way back down to that range, to that accumulation range
what do you want me to say? um, what do you want me to say? this is very likely going to be an accumulation zone for h bar
so if we do enter a large consolidation, i'm not going to talk about trades here on hbar, because uh, i don't like the analysis
so i would, i'm just gonna not do technical analysis in the sh i'll take a look at the four hourly, of course, for you
um, but if we do enter a large consolidation here for the next coming months on h by, okay, in between, in between the levels that we did create in 2019 and 2020, then, of course, i'm going to say, you know, this is very likely going to be a large consolidation, and at some point in the near future we're going to have an insane rally, if it manages to have a large consolidation
i know the project, the team is pretty active, but that is as much as i know on h bar
andy legend, where's d you are an absolute legend for coming here and joining the streams and giving support
this is something that i am going to definitely work on, because i am going to get a course, okay? i will be getting a trading course at the end of the year, is my goal
of course, there will be some merch, okay, for some people that have been doing the course, that have been actually, you know, successfully trading
also with me, i'm going to be super active on a private discord group, all right
and thanks for the idea that says crypto legends, all right, and the crypto legends or something like that
i have, i have no um, doubt, you know, that h bar will probably, um, probably do very, very well in in the next coming years
um, what do you think about eos? eos has been such a bad performer
it's, it's down the sad thing about eos, i know it's a chinese project, if i'm not wrong, we are trading at march of 2020 levels
you know, i think you're probably not going to make huge gains on on this in the in the future
this is below the large accumulation from 2019, you know, 2020, part of 2021
first few months, we had a, we had a a massive crash in march of 2020
will it be the bottom, and we're going to go up here from here? well, i mean, this is up to you
it's only done about a 3x, all right, since the the low levels
of course, in crypto we do want that more, those multiple x's
uh, i don't follow the project, but just by looking at the charts, it's been a such a bad performer compared to other cryptocurrencies, below the summer, below the march 2020 crash
all right, and take a look at the where the march of 2020 crash is, is all the way down here
you know, it's all the way down here at the four thousand dollars
i mean, and this is how bad it can get for for some altcoins such as eos
we having a little bit of bullish momentum here on and bitcoin
your question might be, and let's just focus with with bitcoin here for just one second
i will definitely buy your courses, cornell, uh, absolutely phenomenal
and the, not only the course, i am going to be extremely active in discord, of course
i'm going to be, you know, 100 on on on discord, you know, every single day, you know, sharing analysis on bitcoin and some altcoins, but basically focusing on bitcoin and obviously some all coins, of course, if we do see those opportunities
i mean, that's the most importantly, you know, you absolutely support the um, the the community
i mean, if if bitcoin is going to continue down, bitcoin cash is very likely gonna gonna go down also
uh, huffy says, i told you it's going to break 32, uh, 32 500 today
so you think that bitcoin is going to have a big, massive bounce from this level to the upside? it is possible
i'm, i'm going to tell you what could be a great trading opportunity on bitcoin
and this is, if we do come all the way up here to the 30 500 and get a consolidation at this level, this time, if it does happen this time, and we do consolidate at this range, and we do have a couple of wicks here on the one hourly, i got to say, i got to say i will be bearish
if we do get a large consolidation, and we do see multiple attempts in trying to break this range, it is very likely going to continue back down
it's a super, super strong level, uh, especially if we've sliced down through this range that easy
and, um, this level has only been rejected for the balls, okay? the balls have got rejected at this level
so very likely that the balls will, will get rejected at this level only if we do consolidate at this range
of course, you would have to wait patiently to see the reaction
it was probably not even the 50 fibonacci fifty percent is at the thirty thousand eight hundred dollars
so, um, it's gonna, it's definitely gonna have, there will be some levels here to trade
there will be some volatility if the bitcoin price does manage to get up above this range
if it does get up there, it does get up there, and has multiple attempts in breaking the zone
there will be a moment that you'll have to decide, will this get rejected? will we continue back down? um, whoever hits like number 300 during the live stream gets a free crypto legend tshirt, signed by andy
we actually don't know who's gonna be the number 300, but, yeah, that would be absolutely insane if i couldn't know
you know, i will be doing some, definitely some, some giveaways on crypto legend tshirts
but the most important here for being wrong, after doing technical analysis, you do not need to be the best at technical analysis to make money in the space
you're going to see a bunch of traders and alice saying, you know, technical analysis is 10 psychology is 90? well, i think it's 20
and i would say psychology is 10, and technical analysis is another 10
because if you take a look at the two trades, the last two trades i take, i've taken this week, and i have, still have them open
and i still have, uh, forty percent open of the trade that i did take here yesterday
i did take the the trade yesterday on the just before the live stream
and i've also got that trade open on the btc usd pair on the long position
and guys, anyway, for all of those that are experienced traders, all right, they are experienced, and they do feel confident with their training
then on vibet, you did get an insane bonus of up to four thousand and fifty dollars
okay? you need to go to the rewards hub and follow the steps if you want to claim this bonus
i got the gold trade that is, you know, in some pretty nice profits
because i get the community saying, can you analyze this? and we can do the analysis, and if i like it, i'll, i'll trade it
and the good thing about primex bt, primex bt is my go to place trading platform to trade different markets
of course, i don't, i don't trade 20 markets, because i think that's an absolutely insane i think that's absolutely insane
if i feel confident in trading them, then, yeah, i will trade it
i might trade s p 500, and maybe i'm into natural gas and oil right now
but, yeah, you don't need too many markets, okay? because obviously, if you gain experience, then, yeah, you can take a look at five, you know, six different markets
but you need to focus on one or two to make really good trading
and what i wanted to say here about primex bt, this is my trading platform to accumulate bitcoin
i'm going to accumulate as much bitcoin as i can here with my trading, because i'm using bitcoin as collateral when i'm trading crude oil, s p 500, gold
you like ethereum, and you want to accumulate ethereum, they will pay you in ethereum
and if you don't want to risk any of them, you want stable coins, you can use usdc or usdt as collateral, which is absolutely phenomenal
so you can actually, you know, you're using stable coins, using crypto
you get seven percent added to your deposit if you use my link down below, and bitcoin census 50 as the promotion code
they got over 50 different assets, not only cryptocurrency, they also have forex and all, you know, natural gas and all different type of assets
they're great with commissions, not for swing trading on crypto
i've got to say this, if you swing trading cryptocurrency here, hmm, they're a little bit expensive
this is the thing, it's so cheap to trade gold, oil and some different assets that are not crypto, for swing trading
and of course, if it's another way to support the channel, okay, if you're using the platform with the referral link, absolutely great platform
i just, um, i i got racing pixel here saying, we'll unlike right now so i can hit it again
i just want to explain the two trades that i just took, two trades on bitcoin, of course, this last week, right? and just to explain how risk management is key, is absolutely key for successful trading
but i have this trade over here that i did take down at the twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
and the the the that i did actually take it from the six one eight, from this major rejection
i did explain why i took this pre trade back here on the 27th of may
if you haven't checked out the video, you can go to the 27th of may, and i explain it
i was saying, you know, we were, we're very likely going to have, you know, most of the people, most of the people think that this is a dead cat bounce, and we are just about to roll back down to retest the lows
this is what most of the people think we're gonna have that roll back down
and when you see this big, major support level getting failed to break, uh, break down
where is most of the where is most of the stop losses if you do, if you do see, okay, just a quick explanation on this
okay? it moves like this with this volatility, because it's searching for liquidity
uh, where is the most liquidity? right over here, on top of this peak
so if most of the people think that this is going to roll back down to retest these lows, and i'm going to say thousands, tens of thousands of people are entering trades, short positions, all the way down here, especially with this wick over here, massively entering trades
if these traders are confident that we are going to retest the lows, because we roll them back down, most of their stop losses are going to be above the last lower high ranges
okay, look at this last lower high from this level right over here
what happens? you get that liquidity and you continue to the downside
you know, if i am risking, if i am risking this okay, right over here
and i am looking to gain, to gain this, you know, it's, it's a four, five to one trade
um, and i also, you know, i took thirty percent more profits at this range reaching that target
and also, right over here, if i'm taking this trade, my stop loss was slightly above this rate level
of course, this trade was a one, one and a half to one, because i was eyeing this level
you know, the risk to reward here was absolutely insane, because the probabilities in getting that drop here, also, maybe it was also there
you know, what happens if we do not consolidate at this range and drop lower? so you have a, you know, as soon as we hit this level, i said it yesterday, i'm taking 50 of profits, and i'm protecting my position
because if it doesn't hold, you got a riskfree trade right there
i'm in a long here and i'm in a short here, and they are both protected
i'm in a free winning trade, whatever happens, wherever the price goes
of course, in my course, i will be talking about hedging strategies
it didn't manage then to actually, oh, let me just go to the daily chart
we were talking about the dxy breaking this last lower high and potentially creating a lower high
i do think that we could get a leg up on the dxy in the coming days
why do i think this? because we've broken a big, macro, macro, macro, uh, you know, parabolic uptrend
and i do think, you know, that we this is the end, you know, then
breaking a trend line doesn't mean that you're already going to create, you know, a massive, big downtrend
you could come as high as, you know, the highs, or even slightly high high, uh, but you're actually gonna get rejected from the, from the higher low, uh, trend line
so there is a possibility in creating a lower high, a double top, a slightly higher high, and then it will be the moment where where we'll be entering a massive, big downtrend
we've got big resistance on the dxy um, [Music], yeah, we need a responsible adult here in the comment section, says, tracy wilson, oh, my goodness
what are you guys talking about? i am going to end up the stream, guys
if you want to support the channel, also, just smash up that like button for the algorithm
check out these exchanges that i got down below, if you are interested in trading
and if you are an experienced trader, of course, smash up the like button
i said, are we testing the 25k levels in the coming weeks? i have over 500 votes, and 72 percent of people say yes
we have more people that are bearish, that do think that we are going to come down to retest the 25 000 range
so if most of the people think that we are gonna come down here, do you think it's gonna happen? that is the question that you need to make yourself at the end of this live stream
we do have the latest news, okay, and articles regarding crypto projects
[Music], guys, just one second, i'm just going to give everyone the content
um, i'm tired today, but it's just raining so much outside in sweden, so i think that could be one of the reasons
if you have not already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
um, yeah, we're just going to wait for some people to drop in
if you are new to the channel, my name is natal we will always have, uh, morning live streams from monday to friday
um, so what we're gonna go through this morning is, uh, the setups
um, i can already see, when i look at the chart, that either we will break below this trend line or come back down and retest it
yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna gonna go, gonna go through the setups
oh, why? why? is it anything? what are you up to? what are you doing? are you doing? why are you having a holiday and not the rest of the world? what's so special about you? just joking
i made an, i made my setup an hour before your stream, just to check if i learned good from you and and if it's the same when you start
last time saw was that the third it was? no, yeah, it's crazy
as i said, we have, uh, news coming out 8 15, 8 am on usd i don't know how this is going to affect the market, if it will affect the market, very much
which news was it? not? adp nonfarm employment change? that's what we have, estimate change in the number of employees, your people, during previous month
so, yeah, if we look at dxi, we have the xi on the left side because we did break yesterday
i'm gonna take, sorry, i'm gonna make it a clean chart of btc on the left side, because on the left side i always have my, my, my lower time frames
but now, when we want to compare the pairs together, so everything makes sense
so we hit, we did have this huge drop yesterday because we were inside this fibonacci level, uh, on that on the four hourly, but i, i think i took it on the two, on the two daily chart
but the question is, now, such huge candlestick do? sorry, one guys
i just need to, i need to stink with my little brain, you know
okay, so one thing that i think about when it comes to to the dollars, we are above the previous high at 99800 on the weekly chart
we did have one huge green candlestick, uh? not one huge bearish candlestick that we did close with last week
we also came back, we also broke this previous support at 103 point 100
the only thing that i think about is that, if we're closing above, just one second, i mean, we could technically come back up and retest 103100 again and continue down
based on the the huge candlestick that we do have to the downside
um, we could obviously have one huge, green candlestick, you know, but it doesn't make sense
but based on this low that we did break, i mean, yeah, if we close above, if we close above 103110, in potential retests, that is definitely a continuation for the market to continue to create high highs and higher lows
but we can also come back up to that level [Music] and find it as a resistance, and then come back down again
so looking at the lower time frames now, it looks like we can have a pullback, at least before we're reaching those levels
it looks like we can come back down for a pullback to 102 point, 170 102017, and then see market push back up
if that is the case, we can come back up to, we could come back to 103223, if we combine that with bitcoin
on with, as i told you, we were inside, uh, we were inside the fibonacci yesterday
okay, so if we're looking at the two daily charts, these two fake outs
is a fake no? these two candlestick could represent a fake out from the previous resistance at three thousand, thirty thousand two hundred and thirty
and remember, when i say about the fake outs, is that we usually come back up and retest the previous resistance, and then you see the continuation of the drop
now what i did was that i took a on the 2 12 hourly chart, i took a fibonacci from the high 31 790 back down to the previous high, low
but usually i use it to the higher low that just creep was created
and that kind of makes sense, because if we look at the where the where the resistance is, it is at thirty thousand four hundred
and when i drag the fibonacci from, uh, from this height to this low, that gives us fibonacci numbers between thirty thousand one hundred and ninety and thirty thousand five hundred and sixty five
so we could definitely see the market pull back up to these levels for a retest, and then see the market continue with the drop
so this is definitely, if this is the case, this will definitely be a very good set up for for me to sell the market
if we see the market across this line, it will give me a notification
and around these levels, i expect the market to drop even more, kind of like the setup, actually, hopefully
so next video, my mark is going to be like this, and i'm like, oh, i was so wrong
uh, learning a ton from you, but i have a question about the fibonacci i get multicolors
how do you change that in yours? oh, you just go into whatever settings you have
it's just like everything, um, settings, and you, you can change everything
it's about you, every it's very important that the color, for me, the colors, is really important
i want to show you how my okay, i know i'm not gonna do that, if i'm gonna screw everything up
i had blue, uh, blue candlesticks when it was, uh, bullish candlesticks, and white candlesticks when the market was going down
hey, now, ellie phillip, why are you late? why are you late? i'm just joking
i'm just gonna do a little if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that, because i go through cryptocurrencies every single day
this morning live streams is every single day from monday to friday, one hour before london session
because, as you see now, we have the overview of what actually could potentially happen during the day on bitcoin
so we, we are in some of the steps, you know, you know what i mean
now, we expect the market for a pullback, because we also came back down and retested the trend line, which means that, okay, we can have a little pullback, but then the continuation back down, right? and to tonight, let's say, so it's gonna be around like 15 hours from now, i will have a study and back test ta live with you guys
i i think a lot of people actually learned a lot when it came to the trend lines
i was, i was doing a lot of fibonacci, because fibonacci is definitely one of the biggest tools that i use when it comes to training
market structure, part one and part two always something that i, uh, that i push because you obviously need to know these parts before you you're looking into the other ones
you have to make sure that you understand the whole concept of how the market is moving
that's the only thing that i do, because that's the only thing, not the only thing that i do, 99999
some of you ask me questions, do this, do that? and i always do it
so now my question is to you, do you, do you want to learn? or you do you just want someone to tell you what to do the whole time? what do you do after the live streams? do you practice it? because i know what i show you, and if i were you, i would take advantage of what i do so much
i'm not joking when i say that you're very funny when you try to be
okay, so, and don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on bob, it's up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you're supporting me and bitcoin senses by doing that
so i can sit here every time, ahmad, you can go into my previous back testing live streams
we could potentially, as i told you, i have an alert at 30 240 if the market pushed back up to these levels
if that is the case, i'm waiting for the market to reverse back down
uh, another thing, if we don't have the power to because, uh, the daily candle yesterday was very volatile
but if we go down to the lower time frames, in case we see that the market is not giving us the biggest push, because it just might not have the power to reach these levels
i will also look at twenty nine thousand nine hundred and seventy
so depending on which level the market will respect, i will see that when the market comes to it, hopefully lots of content in library
then two years ago, some bad ah you don't have the guts to hold their bitcoin wells will take profit so fast
we drag fibonacci from the last push to the downside, from 1936, back down to the low at 1 810
that gives us fibonacci levels 1873 and 1880, if we have a push
but remember that we did have such volatility yesterday, so we just might, only, we just might see the drop right now
how does it look on the higher timeframes though? okay, looking at the three hourly charts, it definitely looks like we can have a drop right now
i really like the ethereum chart so much better than i like but okay, so we're gonna do this
if bitcoin, i just really like how the chart on ethereum looks better than bitcoin
now, 26 665, that is the last higher low, uh? because you can see the market doing the pullback on the lower time frames now, because the market needs to make a pullback, but we did have such a huge candlestick yesterday, so it could actually be that we only see the pullback and and then we reverse back down from here
but on bitcoin, i mean, i can obviously go into it right now, but i'm, i'm a little bit unsure
but so that's why i say, if we break below 29 670 and we see retails from below, that is definitely a sign to for me to sell the market
if you're looking at ethereum right now, we came inside fibonacci levels
we broke the support trendline with so this is what we're looking at right so we broke the support trend line, and we also came back up and retested this previous higher low w formation, which is also a sign that the market is on its way down
so when when i trade the market, when when i sell the market from a level that we broke from yesterday, i put um
i have bigger positions, but when we are as slow as we are right now, i just cut them in half, if that makes sense
so i'm no financial advisor, but i just saw the market on ethereum
okay, so i just sold the market on, oh, i need to make it on by bit too
just one second, one of my mentors, i just need to sell the market
someone wanted me to look at dxi on the was it six months? oh, sorry about the echo um
why you remove some of the fib levels and while you choose only those, are you asking me? so, okay, so sorry guys
but we already went through dxi, so we have kind of the understanding of it
and before we go to a bnb, if you want to be part of my community, bitcoin census community, you have it in the chat, in the live chat
if you want to be part of the community where we talk about cryptocurrencies every single morning, you have more contact with me, lauren, just put that link to that telegram group in the chat
so you're more than welcome to be part of that, because we sp we speak about cryptocurrencies every single day, which is really beautiful, because we love that
um and tamesha said, you studies trying to create inverse head and shoulder on the daily
okay, we're gonna go to use third, because use third is also something that i won't need to see over the day, what actually happens
so we're looking at, uh, b bnb because we, we need to, obviously need to go through that, because i promise you
so another thing that we can do right now is that we drag another trendline, because the market did break, another little uptrend
so it's always on the lower time frames where i find my, it is always on the lower time frames where i find my entries
so in this case, what i want b b to do, because we're obviously in such a heavily downtrend, so i'm never gonna look at buy opportunities in a dungeon like this
if i do that, you know, please someone come and push, you know, do this on me, because that's just stupid of me, if i would do that
so if we break below, um, three hundred dollars, and you see a pullback, potentially against the support trend line that we did break, or if you if i use fibonacci against again, that is that, that is, for me, a sign that we are going down, um, based on this fibonacci that we are inside
and the third target is combined with the higher time frames, fibonacci target, the first one
so i definitely believe that we will have a push back down to these levels
because from this fibonacci level right here, take profit one is the one that needs to get taken at 288
i am very honored to have such a great community following me every single day
to be able to work with your love with people that also love it
how are you? okay, so what did uh, to measure? you said something about use third is trying to create inverse and shoulders on the daily
so many things on the charts, tomasso, where? oh, you mean this? i guess that that is what you mean
but the thing is, when we look at the overall picture, it's such a strong, uh, push down, right? and it's a, okay, we have a new monthly chart
i'm not joking when i say that this this week will, oh, okay, so if this week will be filled, we are exactly now at the right point to find, potentially a sell order
because if the market pull back down to this level, from where we are right now, it's so good that i looked at the monthly from where we are exactly now, back down to this level, that is 21, that is almost 22 000 pips
so if if i find a great look at this, okay, we broke your previous resistance, previous support, right here
but that is totally fine now, because we just want to see the overview
and we're in the fibonacci and take profit one is slightly below the low of last month
we have a double information, which means that this could be the drop that we see
oh, i definitely to sell the market on on a theory, on you is 30
so right now, when it down, zoom out and all to measure, your like inverted hammer
you know what if the market on on us 30 now doesn't have to happen today
thank you too, mesh, so much for from for taking, uh to talk about this
okay, so i got four different levels now, either 32 900 or 32 967
from these levels, this could be the entry for me, because i'm no financial advisor, but this could be the continuation of the job
but we can also, if we see a bigger momentum to the upside, because use 30 could be very, it can be very volatile
we could also come back up and retest 33 028 and 33 121, and that could be the drop that we see back down to 30 462
because the monthly, when we look at the previous monthly candlestick, the wick that you can see, the wick that you can see needs to, needs to be filled
maybe not the whole the hole, but we're definitely going to come back down to 30 31, 700, 50 of the candlestick
and we also saw the market retesting this support on the lower time frames from where
because overall, on the higher time frames, the market has broken the uptrend
and now you see, i'm definitely gonna sell the market on us 30, and i'm gonna have my targets pretty far away
um, someone asked me where i, uh, prime expertise is one, uh, platform that i trade
and on prime expt you can also receive a bonus through bitcoin
up to depends on what you are [Music], how much you're depositing
and on buy bait, you can receive a bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars
so on bible, you can receive a bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars
we have this week on the, yeah, on the four, i believe that we just might need to film and then see the reverse back down
so we are at a great, we are at a great level right now when it comes to us 30
no, we didn't look at, we did not look at cardinal, we were looking at us 30
that is why it's so good when when i trade on the lower time frames, uh, when i trade the market when we're this far down, i always, always, uh, trade with lower, uh leverage or lower lot size
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
i don't know exactly what time that is for you, but from this moment now, from this moment, 12 to 13 hours from now, we will have a back testing live session
so if you want to learn more about the technical that i do, that's what we're gonna go through
and as i told you, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy, but it's up
if you did like this live stream, we have the setups right now
um, i went to some short positions right now on ethereum, so we're just gonna have to wait and see how it looks
i hope everyone will have a great day at work, or if you are at home
if you are, whatever you do, i do wish that everyone will have a super great day
and if you want to be part of the community of bitcoin census with me, you will also have it in the live chat pretty soon, because lauren will give it to you
lauren is my wonderful mother moderator that always helped me out
and before you go out from the live stream, please go inside and like it before so we can, as i told you, reach out to more people
uh, what did you say? should i, should i after the stream in the comments section, do the link to fabstan, oh, you can do whatever
my name is josh, and right now the bitcoin price is finding some support along this importance moving average, while the stock market is back in the green today
and we're also forming a brand's new ethereum pattern right now and a new pattern in the bitcoin dominance, which could potentially result in a reversal for the bitcoin dominance, which is good for alt coin holders
but i'll be talking about all of that and more later in the video
and what we have right here is the 000 day simple moving average and the 200 week simple moving average
and these are currently coming in at around 28 and a half thousand and around 22 000, respectively
and you can clearly see that recently on the weekly bitcoin chart, the price of bitcoin has been finding a lot of support along that 1 000 day moving average at around 28 000, approximately
and if you're looking at the last time we saw a lot of support for the bitcoin price along this 1000 day moving average, that was basically at the end of 2019, entering into early 2020
and at that stage in the market, we had already experienced a bunch of bearish price action, and that turned out to be a local low where we saw a pump in the bitcoin price by around 50 percent approximately over the next one to two months
and then, of course, we entered into the march 2020 crash, where we basically bottomed out around that 200week moving average
now we did see a decent week to the downside, but the weekly candle close was at around that 200 week moving average, right where we bottomed out at the end of the 2018 bear market and also at the end of the 2014 bear market
so for now, once again, we are finding a lot of support at around 28 to 28 and a half thousand, according to this 1 000 day simple moving average, which could turn out to be a decent bitcoin bottom, at least in the somewhat shorter term
but if we do end up seeing a confirmed break below 28 000, potentially with a weekly candle close, for example, then technically speaking, according to bitcoin's history, it is entirely possible we could bottom out at around that 200 week moving average, which is sitting between 22 and 23 000 per bitcoin
but obviously there's never any guarantee that we actually make it down towards those prices, which is why i'm simply dollar cost averaging into bitcoin, and i'll go heavier into bitcoin at that stage, just there if we do end up dropping down towards around 22 to 23 000 per bitcoin, but i'm certainly not 100 on the sidelines waiting for those lower prices in order to go all in, because that strategy is extremely risky when it comes to bitcoin
and another reason on the chart that supports the idea of a potential relief rally, maybe even over the next one month or so, like what we saw at the end of 2019, entering into early 2020, is the fact that we're currently seeing a twoday bullish divergence
and the last significance bullish divergence on the twoday bitcoin chart that we saw was back in the middle of last year
and obviously we did end up seeing a lot more bullish price action after that
but keep in mind, during that stage in the market, we saw a lot of bullish price action in the stock market as well
so i'm not necessarily expecting that exact same outcome there, but potentially a bit of a relief rally, something like what we saw between january and march this year
and what we have also just seen here on the twoday bitcoin chart is a bullish cross in the twoday bitcoin macd and the last time this happens on this time frame for bitcoin, it was back during february this year
and the time before that was at the beginning of october, just before we experienced some more bullish price action, and also back in june last year
which is another similarity, on top of this bullish divergence on the twoday bitcoin chart, between what we saw in the middle of last year and what we're seeing at the moment
and just taking a quick look at the daily bitcoin chart, looking at the fractal that compares what we saw in the middle of last year to what we're seeing right now
but according to this fractal, we should technically experience a bit more of a dip within the next one week or so
otherwise, if we don't really see any more downside price action over the next one week, it's pretty much safe to say at that point that this fractal in particular has been invalidated
but whether we do or don't, revisit that initial load that we set during may like what we saw in the middle of last year
either way, this fractal isn't here to tell us an exact bitcoin price prediction
instead, it shows us previous bitcoin price action so that we know at least what is possible
and for the most part, according to this fractal, it does suggest more choppy sideways press action over the next one month, relatively speaking, and then a bit more of a bullish recovery heading into july and maybe into august
but if you're looking at the shortterm bitcoin charts, on the fourhour time frame, what we see right now is a perfect bounce from this golden pocket, as i discussed yesterday
and in case you missed my last bitcoin update video, this golden pocket is coming into play at around 29 and a half thousand, where once again, we found perfect support
and right now, at the time of recording this video, the price of bitcoin is approaching this line of resistance, coming into play at around 30 700
and if we end up seeing a confirmed break back above 30 700, then i would expect bitcoin to revisit this high, coming in at around 32 000, approximately
but on the flip side, if we do end up finding some more resistance along this level at around 30 700, and potentially get a rejection from that level, which is possible, then i'd expect the bitcoin price to revisit this low, coming in at around 29 and a half thousand
and anything below that, we have, of course, major supports coming into play at around 28 and a half thousand
and as you might have already guessed, if you're a regular viewer here on the channel, one of the reasons why we've seen a bit of a bounce today in the bitcoin price is due to the fact that we've also seen a bounce in the stock market after yesterday's selloff
and if you want to know one of the main reasons why we did end up seeing a bit of a selloff in the stock markets yesterday
definitely check out my last bitcoin update video that i posted yesterday on the channel, because in that video, i talked about the fed news yesterday, which was the fact that the federal reserve is beginning quantitative tightening
and in recent videos here on the channel, i've been comparing this bullish move in the stock market, specifically in the nasdaq 100 index here on the daily time frame, to what we saw during march this year
because just before that rally in the stock market, we saw a w pattern form, which is exactly what has formed in recent weeks for the nasdaq 100 index
and another similarity is the fact that march is the last month of the first quarter, and right now we're entering the last month of the second quarter, which could potentially be another reason, on top of that w pattern on the charts, as to why we could experience a bit more of a relief rally in the shorter term, looking over the next couple weeks or so
and in that case, if that scenario plays out, that would be good news for the bitcoin price, because the bitcoin price and the stock market are correlated a lot of the time
and in case you're new to the channel, this just means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum for ethereum
and ever since we've formed the bullish divergence, that's pretty much exactly what we've seen
and once again, the last bullish divergence on the daily ethereum charts that we've seen of this size was back during march, just before we experienced a relief rally, while the stock market was pumping during that time
and just giving you a quick update on the ethereum long positions on the bifenex exchange, which are still expanding
and within the last two days, we've seen over 180 million dollars worth of ethereum long positions open up
and at the same time as this happening, we've seen another decline in ethereum's short positions today on the bitfenix exchange
and if you want to know exactly what this means for ethereum, definitely check out my last ethereum update video that i posted yesterday on the channel
because this is just a quick followup from yesterday's video, because in yesterday's video i went into much more detail about these charts
right here now, taking a quick look at ethereum's shorter term price action on the six hour charts
and technically speaking, ethereum is forming a descending triangle pattern, which is traditionally a bearish pattern, because the price structure itself shows lower highs and horizontal lows, which reveals an increase in selling pressure and stagnant buying pressure
but right now, at the time of recording in this video, the price of ethereum has not made its way back down towards this line of support, at least just yet
so if instead we form a higher low, then that could potentially invalidate the formation phase of this descending triangle pattern, which would be a good sign for ethereum
because, of course, a descending triangle pattern is, once again, a bearish pattern
so if we invalidate the pattern with a higher low forming instead of another horizontal low, then that would be good news for ethereum
but with that being said, we'll still have confirmed resistance coming into play at around 1950, approximately
because regardless of the descending triangle pattern, that is already a confirmed descending line of resistance to pay attention to
and now looking at the ethereum versus bitcoin chart on the three day time frame, and obviously we're still looking more bearish than bullish in terms of the larger trend here
and that shortterm bounce after reaching this support line in the 3day rsi was obviously shortlived
but if you're zooming in a little bit into the daily time frame for ethereum vs bitcoin, we do have the possibility of forming a bullish divergence here
but this has not been confirmed as of right now, i want to make that clear
but we do have to set up in place, because the rsi is well and truly in higher lows, while the price action is nearly in lower lows, if you're looking at the daily candle closes
so all we need to see is lower lows in the daily kennel closes, while the daily rsi stays in higher lows in order to actually form these bullish diversions, and then to confirm the higher low in the daily rsi, we will then need to see a green daily candle
and if that happens, then a bullish divergence for ethereum vs bitcoin on the daily chart would be confirmed
and if that plays out, we could reduce our bearish momentum here for ethereum vs bitcoin, which means ethereum could hold up pretty well against bitcoin, at least for the next few days, maybe in the next few weeks
but if you're looking at the bitcoin dominance chart, we're forming basically the opposite, because, of course, the bitcoin dominance usually does the opposite of ethereum versus bitcoin, and so on
the bitcoin dominance chart here, on the daily time frame, we are forming a bearish divergence
and technically speaking, we already have one confirmation of a bearish divergency on the daily chart for the bitcoin dominance
and this just means we could be losing some of this bullish momentum in the bitcoin dominance, at least in the shorter term, which could be a good sign for old coins
but i want to make it clear, this does not confirm a massive altcoin season as of right now
it just means some of the pressure might be taken off the alt coins, at least in the shorter term, if this does end up playing out
but keep in mind, if you zoom out a little bit further, we have seen bearish divergences in the past that have taken quite a while to play out
i'm talking about one month or so in order to actually play out
so for me to flip much more bullish again on the alt coin markets compared to what bitcoin is doing, i'd like to say more than just this
but with that being said, this is still a good sign, at least in the shorter term, for the alt coin market, because, like i said, it could reduce some of that extreme selling pressure we've seen in alt coins recently
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so what exactly is going on over here? well, let's take a closer look
so taking off of yesterday, where i showed this chart over here, i said that bitcoin could potentially push up into the circle area
i mean, we can kind of move that along yet, because not even aligned anymore
so we can lower that level so it's around the 33 800 level, and then i would expect a more than likely rejection from that level and for price to come back down
so it's showing some sort of area of, uh, indecision, and it could potentially take another leg up
but when i look at the altcoins, i'm noticing a lot of weakness
and i'm only going to show you two specific alt coins, uh, one that i have actually taken a short position on
i'm gonna zoom out first, so let's go into the eight hour chart
essentially this is the broader picture of what you'll see with tron
so you can see you've got the trend line that's governing the highs, lower highs throughout, and then you do have higher lows throughout
was a bitcoin in 2017, and i don't know if they've revamped, rebranded, what exactly they've done
but essentially, it's just a very good risk to reward ratio, which was my reasoning for looking to take this trade
but what i have over here is the previous, uh, wick over there
so i've said to myself, well, hey, i'll place my stoploss just above that wick if this trade manages to trigger anywhere within this yellow circle
but if price were to break anywhere above this week over here, then i'm probably wrong
and i'm pretty much, i'm just looking for quick sculpts, small part of my portfolio
i'm taking about a one percent risk on any of these trades that that i have, meaning that if i'm wrong, i only lose one percent of my trading account, which your risk to reward is important, right? so if you have a look at this, uh, let's just take that down
so if you have a look, let's say you enter on average around there, you got 13
and of course, this is going to be dependent on what bitcoin does, and if bitcoin shows any sign of weakness
of course, we have quantitative tightening beginning today as well
but zooming in, i can give you a closer perspective over here
i think i went really, really close to the invalidation point, which is over here
and by the way, guys, this is in the newsletter, so if you have a look on my twitter, i'll share the link
again, if you subscribe to the newsletter, you can get a more high quality view, so that you can actually look and toggle on trading view to see exactly how and we have entered these trades
and oh, by the way, if you do wish to take these trades, please make sure that you have a look on, uh, buy bits
it's pretty much the only way that, i guess, you can give back, unless, okay, so if you have a look over here, and you go down below, you'll see all my details are there for my twitter
and then underneath, we do have the bybet link over there, if you want to join sheldon and myself on the trading journey
i'm not going to say that i'm as ambitious as he is in turning 400 into a million, but i'll do the best that i can
so i'm taking very, very secure trades, as i said, that's why i'm looking to go as close to that invalidation point as possible
then i'm about thirty percent entered over here, fifty percent entered halfway through, and then i leave the last fifty percent for right before
which means that if i'm wrong and price goes against me, i stop out very soon afterwards
over there you can say, well, it's invalidated and you are out of the position
so if you take a look at roon, we kind of had it, uh, in this parallel channel, making low lows and lower highs, sort of tried to break out over there
and then i said in the newsletter that if on the horror key, horizontal level, it started to show weakness over there, and lose that level, there could be a potential opportunity on a short trade over here
and i have a more zoomed in approach of exactly how that's working out and what's going on
so if anyone took this, i don't know if the newsletter is even out yet, you would have been stopped out
so if you have a look at this area over here, this is now in the 15 minute chart, by the way, if you manage to take that zone out, then you've created a new swing high, and i'll be stopped out of the trade
but any if you broke this trend line over here, i was looking to build an entry and scale in bit by bit
i have posted everything on my twitter so make sure that you follow me over there
you can see you would have already got the chart update with everything even before the show began
not much has changed, uh, compared to what we're looking at yesterday
everything is kind of still the same trade setups that i showed yesterday on the eight hour chart

well, you one of the key correlations that you'll see me mention is the correlation between bitcoin and us
the nasdaq moved sharply higher, but bitcoin failed to follow
and that was quite concerning given what's happened in crypto over the last few weeks
the nasdaq moves sharply higher, but bitcoin failed to rally last week
and now we're seeing some consolidation at the highs for the next leg higher, potentially
i do very much believe that it is the nasdaq and the bitcoin correlation that is going to force the market in one way or the other
the nasdaq will probably lead, and it's coming into some resistance at about the 13k handle, and it'll be interesting to see what it does
there if it can flip that resistance as support, we should see another leg higher, and bitcoin to follow
but failure to close above and flip that level, we'll see another leg, probably down to the lows for bitcoin
today is the day that the fed will commence their tapering process
markets per minute, and that will ramp up to as much as 22 million dollars down towards the end of the year, towards september
obviously, as there is money and liquidity being pulled out of the market, there is less capital to take on risk
and i've spoken about that in my newsletter and in recent videos, if you'd like to go and check those out
but essentially, less capital available to take risk means that risk assets need to be repriced
but how much of that has already been priced in is the question
now here is the correlation between bitcoin, us equities and the fed balance sheet
the fed balance sheet, obviously, has been moving parabolically ever since the global financial crisis, during massive qe programs ever since
but now we're moving into tightening and a shrinking of that balance sheet
and they have already moved lower because of the fed's forward guidance
up to date, ever since quarter three, quarter four, 2021, we had guidance from the fed that they were going to start tightening their monetary policy
and the markets have reacted ever since, and we haven't really had a substantial bounce in risk assets
i think that the forward guidance from the fed will continue to drive markets
and perhaps the fed have already done most of the tightening via their language and by their forward guidance onto the market, to allow it to organically price in what they're saying each time they speak
so to sum up that tapering process, what's involved? for treasury securities that the fed has been purchasing, the cap will be initially set at 30 billion per month in their roll off of the balance sheet
in three months, that will increase to 60 billion dollars per month
for agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities, the cap will initially be set at 175 billion dollars per month, and after three months, will increase to 35 billion dollars per month
so for the first three months, you'll see about 50 billion dollars worth of roll off of the fed balance sheet
and that will ramp up to about 90 billion dollars worth or 95 billion dollars worth towards september and into the end of the year
and obviously what they do from there will be dictated by the data
if they need to pause and stop tightening, that will be very bullish for risk assets, very bullish for bitcoin and us
and that guidance will come off of the back of poor data, deteriorating data, that says that the fed have tightened, they've changed the conditions of the us
and obviously, when they've tamed inflation, we will see them shift and pivot to a more neutral stance, and perhaps even a more dovish stance
and at that point we will see a macro bottom in crypto and in equities
i still think we're a little while away from that, because of the current conditions
we're seeing data start to peak, but it needs to peak consistently over the course of perhaps even a few quarters
so this narrative still has a little while to play out into the end of 2022
but there is light at the end of the tunnel, i think right now the fed are saying that they're thinking that a 50 basis point hike is appropriate for the next couple of meetings
that would imply, june july, we see a 50 basis point hike at each meeting
and as you can see here, the market is pricing in with a 968 probability that the fed hikes by 50 basis points in june, and then with a 942 probability that they do that again in july
and as we've seen so far, during 2022 and late 2021, the fed meetings, the fomc meetings, have been a sell the room us to sell on a bit of fear into the event
but once we see a 50 basis point hike that's already priced in, it's a buy the news type of events
so to sum up the macro side of things and the positioning of players in the market right now, they're all playing that narrative of the feds forward guidance
and when that forward guidance begins to shift off of the back of data shifting, we will see a macro bottom in crypto and in equities
it's going to take, like i said, a few months of data for that to play out and see whether conditions are tightening enough for the fed to start to pivot
the data that impacts and directs the fed's mandate of stable pricing and maximum employment is really key now that's going to drive what they say into the future
on friday, we have us employment data, which guides the federal reserve's policy setting in accordance with their mandate
but other than that, there's not a whole heap on the calendar this week that is set to drive markets
next week will be the key week, with cpi data due, inflationary data that affects stable pricing, the fed's mandate
that will be a very, very key event that drives markets and gives an indication as to whether the overall forward guidance and the tightening process commenced by the fed is having an effect on the market
if we start to see that inflation rating peak, the markets will begin to have some relief, and we can see a bounce, potentially, in risk assets, including crypto, that core cpi rating comes in on friday, which is a bit of a change
usually it's earlier on in the week, but next week it is on friday
so keep an eye on that, and i will keep you informed when it comes time

[Music], my crypto legends, i hope everyone is having a fantastic day today, wednesday
let's analyze the situation here for bitcoin and see what is going to go on in the next coming hours, next coming days
what is the highest probability scenario to happen for bitcoin? all right, and this is what we're going to analyze, mainly focusing on bitcoin, of course
i want to talk about some major levels, what could happen, of course, in the next coming weeks
and also take a look at the immediate, short term scenario, the scenario that we have been talking about in today's video the last few days, the kind of movements i was potentially expecting, and what could happen from this range
and i would say there is a higher probability and coming at least, to test the 30 hundred, thirty thousand five hundred
all right, bitcoin losing a thousand dollars of its value approximately in the coming hours, maybe before the end of today, after this consolidation
if i just go to the one hourly chart here, zoom in a little bit, we can see, all right, the price of bitcoin having this attempt yesterday
i mean, this next one now was the moment to actually try and continue to the upside
this little pump that we did have just about an hour ago was the opportunity for bitcoin
could it come back up right now and retest again? yes, it is possible
this is showing me exhaustion right now on the price of bitcoin, telling me that the likely scenario is coming down to retest the thirty thousand five hundred dollars
and the next coming now is potentially, and this is why i am in a short position at this moment
and this is a hedge position, position against my long position that i do have right over here
from this twenty eight thousand six hundred, twenty eight thousand seven hundred dollar range that i did enter here just a few days ago
i've still got 20 of my position open, totally protected, just in case the price of bitcoin does decide to bounce from this level and actually break successfully this range and continue to the upside
but, you know, like i said, this is absolutely, i mean, if we do go down there from this live stream, this is gonna be absolutely phenomenal
you're gonna, you know, because, according to to the analysis that i am doing, you know, the most amount of times that you try and break this resistance and you fail, the most likely it is going to have that correction, right? that kind of bart some pattern right over here, as you can see
a lot of people might think, right? this is ready to explode to the upside, because the more times we retest, the more times it is likely to finally break and continue to the upside
in this case, for me, this is, um, a clear exhaustion of the price
okay? saying that it is higher pr there's a higher probability in actually getting this correction at this moment, at least to the thirty thousand five hundred, thirty thousand six hundred, give or take a few hundred dollars, because we have some wicks over here
you know, you might even not come as low as 30 500, but maybe, yes, around about the 30 700
okay? if i do get, um, you know, this, um, this move to the downside, as soon as we start hitting the 30 700, i am going to protect my position
and, you know, if i do get stopped out from this position over here, because my stop loss is just above this wick over here, around about the 33 000, i've given it a little bit of room
okay? the amount that i am risking from this level, all right? is, it's a one to one trade, one and a half, approximately
and, um, but the possibilities, and this one actually, you know, getting that dead cat balance, that lower high and continuing back down is very, very, very, very possible also
so this is the thing, this is the thing, you know, i am hedging myself from this long position over here
you know, i took most of my profits, i took 50 and all the way up to 80 of profits, all the way up here
so now seeing these this rejection, this is what we were talking about on yesterday's video, in today's video, you know, wait, let's wait to see what happens
because this could absolutely, you know, this move to the upside could have absolutely exploded out of this resistance
i'm gonna wait patiently in between, you know, yesterday and today, and see what happens
what happens? bang rejection from this major level that we've been talking about for the last few days
now, just today we were at the third attempt to see if we were going to even reach the highs, and it totally failed
that is, this is the area that i am looking to short right over here, because you have several attempts and breaking a major resistance, you can't break resistance, it is very likely to go down
the probabilities is is higher that this is a, you know, the the balls, the demand is failing right now
the probability right now to come down to the 30 700, 30 600 range, this level over here is is very, very high
it's very, very high that you're gonna have that, that push back down to this range
and it's very, very high the the probabilities ain't getting this bound from this major level today in today's video
anybody that missed it, anybody that is joining the live stream at this moment, you know, i want to know in the comment section, and before guys, you make sure to smash up that like button right away, right now
but what i want to tell you know, what do you think about this scenario? i mean, i don't want to put a poll on this
i don't want to put, well, let's just, you know, let's, i'm going to write it because a lot of people probably haven't even seen it
what do you think about this scenario? what do you think about the december 2021 fractal, which is this one? um, will it happen? will it happen? because, yeah, the answer is yes or no in this case, will it happen? will it happen? guys? let me know in the comment section
and this is, you know, there are very, very strong similarities
i'm going to go through the comment section, because that is, this is my favorite, saying hello to the community, saying hello to my mods
so i just want to know your answer, guys, the fractal that we were talking about in today's video, i'm explaining it
if you haven't seen that video, go in and take a look at this morning's video, because it's very, very similar some of the scenarios that could happen on bitcoin, getting that massive rejection from this 32 000 range
and you know, funny enough, i am seen already, because i am subscribed to other youtubers, you know, apps crypto youtubers, because i like to see what kind of sentiment they do have, because it is important
and i do see some of them, they are, you know, going a little bit extremely bullish
and we were talking about this right over here, down at these, sorry, not here, down at these levels
you know, i want to wait for the price of bitcoin to have that leg up, have that stop, have that another leg up, and have that stop here at 32 000
and this will be the moment that we're going to start seeing some youtubers going extremely bullish, you know, with these some crazy price targets
i'm all in on bitcoin, and, um, yeah, i said, this is the moment i am going to be bearish, very, very likely
i mean, this could turn around from this point and have a big, massive pump
you know, it has been spot on, spot on, because, you know, there are some similarities
i'm not going to explain it right now on the live stream, of course, maybe later
i want to go through the comment section, which is most importantly, and you know, definitely know your answer
okay, from the poll, do you think this fractal will happen on bitcoin
if we come down here, i mean, whoever says technical analysis does not work? experience on the charts, you know? yeah, nothing to say
i'm accumulating as much bitcoin as i can ethereum, at these levels, there will be some altcoins such as chain link, my beloved chain link
um, at these price levels, even if we go to slightly low levels, which i do think could happen? we could see chain that got about four or five dollars
i'm gonna scoop up some at those levels if we do go down there
and you know what i'm going to say? comment down below in the comment section what i was just about to say
yo, what's up, my man? seb, how are you doing? one of my goodness moderators here, mark dutch, also here
um, the thing is, where is the neckline? oh, my i mean, look at this, guys
i've got to say, this is absolutely amazing, absolutely incredible
and, you know, let's go to the, i don't know, one hourly chart
could we turn around from here? yeah, i mean, this is the moment that i'm going to start protecting my position slightly lower, 30 700 is my target range
i could see the possibility in ghosts getting rejected at this level
um, guys, if you are interested in training, of course you are experienced down below, you do have an insane bonus of up to four thousand and fifty dollars
i was expecting some higher levels, but i already started to short at this range
also, the reason why is because in trading, in investments, in the market in general, in general, no one is going to buy the exact bottom
okay, there are going to be a very low percentage of people that do, but it is very hard, very hard to buy the exact bottom or sell the exact high
so some strategies that i have been using is actually dollar cost average into a position
what does this mean that if i am looking for potential shorting opportunities at this level, and i'm pretty confident of my analysis, and i do not need to wait for a consolidation or a rejection, um or a reaction, you know, you could start dollar cost averaging into a position to make, you know, if, like i said a lot of the times on the live stream, you know, if i am going to risk two percent of my capital, which is, you know, it would be a pretty big position
um, you know, i'm going to start off with, you know, 05 percent, and as we go closer to my potential entry, i will be adding 055 until i get to that
um, two percent um position that i want to make on my capital
so if you get in here, and also the price comes all the way up here, and get in here, you will have a average price in the middle, okay, which is round about the area that you want to get in
so anyway, um, [Music], andy, is there a diamond pattern forming playing out on bitcoin? let's take a look
i mean, let's take a look, uh, the diamond pattern? um, yes, yes, i do see something
and, yeah, you could arguably discuss that this is a diamond pattern, uh, spot on
uh, it's not the most beautiful, not the most beautiful, but you could see, they're, like, the intentions right of it, of this being a kind of a diamond pattern
[Music], yeah, you could, you could arguably discuss that this is a kind of a diamond pattern, especially because there is, i mean, one of the most important things for a diamond pattern is not to exactly touch the resistance and the support levels
it is to see price volatility from the low center bit to the high, um, to the high point of the diamond with a big spike in volume
and this couldn't be, you know, the best, i mean, this is the best example right now where you do have very low volume from the start of the diamond, a spike in volume in the center, and then, you know, no volume on the right side of the diamond, as you can see here
it's not the best, beautiful formation of a diamond reversal top, but you can see technical analysis and trading is not perfect
um, it was pretty clear that this was a price exhaustion at this level, hitting this major resistance zone
if we were to go with a textbook technical analysis target from this diamond top pattern, we would go from the top here to the support level
and from the from the center bit of the diamond, which would be round about these levels, you know, you are looking for that 30 500 range, which would be the target
where is this range? this is where we do have the large consolidations here on bitcoin as resistance
so it does make sense that we could be hitting those levels in the next coming hours
you know, i would stay cautious, of course, if you didn't start entering a short position
um, yeah, this is not an entry point at this, at this moment in my opinion
you could have a pretty aggressive wick to the upside, to the center bit of the of the of the diamond, and then come back down
um, but yeah, the very likely scenario would be coming down to that 30 600 range, give or take a few hundred dollars
um, i saw a diamond top on the btc one hour chart, the master ll, yeah, i think that
i would give it as valid, uh, i would give it a, you know, a valid diamond top because of the spike in the middle of the diamond, the spike in volume in the middle of the diamond, um, and low volume on the sides of the diamond
um, why would that be wrong and stupid? i mean, i'm just, i can explain you how hedging can be an insanely profitable thing to do, because, i mean, i'm just a quick explanation, because, i, i do not agree it's a stupid thing to do, you know, just, you know, just to keep it simple, just like i'm going to explain it to a fiveyearold kid
you know, if i gonna buy, if i'm gonna buy something here and i want to sell it to more, you know, and more expensive, right? i want to get, you know, two, three, four, five times, you know what it's valued at
and what if i can actually sell it to higher levels? well, i'm gonna keep some of them
you know, if i've got five sweeties, you know, and i can sell, you know, the rest of the sweeties much more expensive, i'm gonna keep one just in case, you know, and protect it at the same price, just in case i can get, you know, a 10x out of it
but, you know, i know in this case that we are hitting major resistance levels
so i'm going to hedge into a short position because i do think that there is a high probability that the price of bitcoin will not successfully break the 32 600 in the immediate, short term
there's a short term analysis, 30 minute, two hourly, one hourly chart
i mean, this is the thing, if i do get stopped out, if it's a similar position, and the price of bitcoin does turn around from this range, i will get stopped out out of my short position here at these levels, but i will be riding still this major long position that i do have, that percentage still that i got open from this position
and i do know that there won't be much resistance from this range, okay, until round about the 35 000 is my next big resistance level that i will go through in the next videos
of course, you know, it's not worth looking at resistance that we do have, you know, uh, are very far away because, yeah, we want to do range trading
we want to know what is happening today? what is happening this week? i don't care
you know people that talk about alltime highs at this point? yeah, it's not going to happen anytime soon
chain link is in a big, huge kind of, i would say, i don't know, descending wedge
i don't want to take a look at chain link, but short term analysis on chain link
and, you know, some major, major things that could happen on chain link
i mean, i don't see this having a a successful move if bitcoin starts dropping
of course, what happened here, and let me just go zoom in on the one hourly chart, what happened here on on chain link is that you basically broke out from this lower high level, right? these lower highs over here
you bounced once from the retracement, and you had a high height, slightly higher high here
so the probabilities in chain link actually dropping down again from this range is very, very high, because you've already got one bounce
you kind of created a slightly higher height, double pop, double top scenario
if bitcoin starts dropping, uh, much lower than, of course, chain link is is gonna follow
uh, what i want to show you here is the bitcoin dominance, the bitcoin dominance getting, you know, uh, there's some more price action to the upside um, more price action to the upside
i think the bitcoin dominance in the next coming months, this could be two months, it could be six months, um, it's gonna take quite some time
but it can go as high as 54, 55, in my opinion, where we do have very, very strong consolidation levels
i don't think we could go much, much higher from there, you know, looking for the 50 fibonacci from this whole drop, and getting a large consolidation, and then continuing back to the downside, you know, by 2023 or so
um, so, yeah, this is the thing, if bitcoin dominance goes up, you know, and and with that, the bitcoin price goes down
this is the worst case scenario that could happen for 99 of all coins
you don't need to be the best technical analysis guy to make money in the market
you i think, most important, most important thing, most of the people say, yeah, 90, it's, um, you know, uh, psychology, 10 technical analysis
you can have great psychology in your head, you know, you can't be, you know, it's just, it's just amazing
you have no risk management, no matter how much psychology, no matter how much weed you smoke, you know, you you're gonna lose money if you don't have, um, risk management
i best thing is to risk one, two percent, of three percent of your capital
people that have a thousand dollars in their account need to look for trades of 20, 30
and it's hard to have, you know, it's, it's hard to think, you know, that, you know, if you have one hundred thousand dollars in your account, you need to look for trades of two, three thousand dollars
if you have fifty thousand dollars in your account, you know, you're looking for one percent
you're looking for trades of 500, sorry, uh, yeah, around about 500, a thousand dollars
and that's how, you know, it is the best way to trade and protect your capital
the people that have a thousand dollars in their account and risk 500 or 200, yeah, this is no, you you're very likely going to burn your account after a few stop losses
uh, any please, andy, please, can you take a look at gold? says mars, absolutely
uh, can you take a look at um, cardano, dxy, is pumping? oh, my goodness
i mean, there's so many things to take a look at here for the community
i mean, this is the thing, i think the dxy, um, you know, we broke this level
and actually, you know, once you break a trend line, this doesn't mean you are going to go down, you know, from this level
i think there is a possibility here that breaking this trend line is already seeing signs of weakness on the dollar
but this doesn't mean, you that you can pump then create a lower high
you know, the confirmation of a downtrend, a downtrend on the dxy, is not confirmed yet
this could have, you know, the entire month of june in an uptrend
and we are looking ideally for that double top scenario, lower high or slightly higher high, in the next coming months
after this kind of parabolic move that we have had since march, it went a little bit parabolic in just, um, under two months
what's going on with gold? why not? there is something very interesting that i do want to show you
and i was just doing some, you know, drawing some lines, thinking where the the price of gold could go
let's get some old drawings out of the way and do fresh analysis on gold here for one second
let's go to the threeday chart, zoom out a little bit on gold, and i'll give you my personal opinion
broke out from this channel, went sideways, uh, to do maybe a lot of, maybe a lot of you might think that this, is this a cup and handle? is this a cup and handle forming? well, the the handle is already going over 50 down from the actual cup
so from this, you know, you could arguably discuss, is this a cup and handle? and you are going to see gold in the next coming months, uh, months and couple of years, of course, because this is the three day chart
you could only discuss something like this, the body of the candles even better
i mean, this, i think we probably can get a really, really good bounce
there is a harmonic pattern right over here, which looks pretty, pretty good
uh, let me just check here with the harmonics, the measured moves with, um, with the percentage
let me just, let's do harmonic here a little bit because, i mean, this could be pretty bullish
i think we could have a pump on gold in the next couple of weeks, all the way up here to the 1920 920
and, you know, we're getting supported, you know, the more confluence you add here from this higher, low support trend line
i mean, a little bit kind of bearish from this double top, but we are getting supported from this trend line, and we've got a bullish bat pattern
let me just show you right away here with the fibonacci levels
as you can see on the chart, from x point over here, from this trend line, the last higher low, from the support level to the high on gold, we can see that we've had this movement coming down to the, you know, if you want to count the volatility, you could go as low as the 618, approximately, like i just showed you before
um, we got, you know, uh, the c point here bounced back up to the 50 percent also, you know, three, eight, two, fifty percent
and then the leg down to the point 88, where we have had that consolidation
um, the target number one from this, uh, bat pattern, bullish bat pattern, where you should be having that price action here to the upside, big bounce from this range
i mean, i'm not gonna do a full analysis on this, but you do have this supportive trend line as you can see here on the chart, respecting it very, very nicely, getting that bounce
the target number one is getting the fibonacci retracement from c to d here
and you are, you know, you already got a beautiful rejection at the 382 to the exact dollar here on on gold
uh, i will let you know that people on the telegram group, it's pretty, pretty nice entry at this exact moment on gold for a potential long position after this big, major drop
i mean, i would be looking for this consolidation, this range over here, this consolidation range the 1920 fibonacci level, from the low to the high, from the height to the low
it's a large consolidation the probabilities in gold here, actually creating a higher low and getting a big bounce to that
one thousand to one thousand nine hundred and twenty dollars is extremely high
i would go with a stop loss here, all the way down here at 1 780
the good thing about primex bt, you are using bitcoin as collateral
you can use ethereum as collateral, or usdc or usdt as state, you know, the stable coins as collateral, and you can trade a huge amount of markets, gold, crude oil, silver, you name it
over 10 trick they must have about 15, but, um, yeah, this is absolutely insane
and, you know, if we do an alice it all together, if i do see an opportunity, of course, i'm not going to risk a huge amount, you know, small positions in gold
i do actually like the the, you know, this potential trade of gold going to 1 920 in the next coming weeks
and the fees on primax bt are extremely, um, you know, they are really, really cheap
if you are interested, i got a full tutorial only for experienced traders, please
um, you know, there's a full tutorial on how to use this platform
and you get seven percent added to your deposit, which i think is absolutely insane, absolutely insane
looking for, yeah, i i like this, this position over here, three, um, i'm long on gold
gold has been dropping for the last, you know, few weeks very aggressively, from two thousand dollars all the way down to one thousand eight hundred
so i am looking for that potential relief rally, you know, stoploss below this level, you know, stopped out
it does look pretty good to hold this range to at least get a relief rally to the six, one, eight from this level over here
um, yeah, the 618, this large consolidation, which is very likely to get rejected, very likely to get a reaction at this level
and it is also the target of this bat pattern, you know, adding confluence, adding confluence here with this higher lows uptrend
you know, is this going to fall down forever? no, it's already getting a reaction from this range
the probabilities of this having a bounce, for me, are very, very high
you know, as soon as you start getting and hitting the 50 fibonacci retracement
this is a level where i would be taking some profits and protecting my position
so if we do have that leg up, it's a take profit area, protect position, just in case the price rolls down
but i am looking for that 1920 here on gold here in the immediate, short term, looking for that, you know, one week, two week trade potentially
i mean, this is the thing, i've got several trades open at this moment
they're all, they're almost all of them are doing pretty good
why? who does this on youtube guys? i mean, smash up that like button if you if you like the content
i have no one explaining why are you entering? what patterns can you see? where are your targets? why are you placing your stop loss here? you know, risk management
nobody is doing that if somebody is actually explaining entries and, you know, and and patterns and and, you know, not crappy technical analysis
guys, uh, who has not smashed that like button yet? says, tracy, thank you very much
who are we gonna go with this? i mean, i do think gold can potentially go to lower levels, uh, in the next coming months
i'm looking for, there's a little bit of shortterm trade there
i think there are some gains to be made on that movement on gold
it was absolutely, it's absolutely insane how sometimes you know you're in the zone
but these last few days it has been pretty good with some potential targets and movements on bitcoin
let me just go, um, go here through the poll, because i did ask the community, you know, what did you think about this bitcoin fractal? you know, do you think it's going to play out in the next coming weeks, where we are potentially going to have bitcoin going to much lower levels
but i do think, you know, we could actually, you know, break this 30 500 range and retest this low area at 29, 28 000
what has happened here with cardano? what? what? fib level? oh, we almost hit the six one eight
we didn't hit the six one eight, so we're not respecting these fib levels at this moment
um, the possibilities of cardano getting a bounce, i think, are very, very high after breaking this lower high trend line, these lower highs, we've got some major levels where, you know, we could get a bounce on cardano
but it's very, i mean, it's, it's, it's not, um, it's not a chart that i like to to analyze
i have, i think i've never traded cardano, remember, maybe once or twice
but, um, i would be looking, yeah, i mean, pretty high volume from this breakout
bitcoin comes down to thirty thousand five hundred dollars in the next coming hours, you might see cardano get a push down to around about 54, 53 cents
we do have a big, strong level on the vpvr from the volume traded the last 2025 days
we can already get supported from this level over here on cardano
but i do think, you know, after such a big pump for the last, you know, four or five days, uh, a larger correction is very, very possible
we can probably, if we do get a reaction at this 53 cent level, we got a big spike on the vpvr, we got a large consolidation area, and we, you know, we would be looking for some fib levels from this low to the high
you know, that would be, that would be the ideal, the six one eight, we got the six one eight ride over here from the the this pump over here, which would be absolutely phenomenal, getting that bounce at the 618 to the largest point of control from the volume traded from the last 20 days, and look for that potential leg up
uh, i would be, i would do a day trade, or a small swing trade, depending on how long it's going to take, because you could get that exhaustion and roll back down
if the cardona price goes all the way down to 53 cents, that would be my, my level for a potential day trade, scalp all the way to this resistance zone, which is at the 58 cent level, where we are trading right now at this moment
so if you do get that kind of price action, there is some money to be made on that movement
if, obviously, if we do go down there and get a small reaction
and, yeah, basically this is going to be it for this live stream, guys
if i do have time, i will be doing another, maybe live stream tonight, maybe a video update
i mean, if you enjoy the live streams, smash up the like button
it's always good to see the dislikes to see what type of videos you need to make, or not
and then i've got 20, i'm sorry, i've got 100 of this trade at this moment, but i'll be having 50 of that trade once we hit this level
i do think that that leg down is very likely, at least to the 30 700 range
that is my take profit one from that short position here, all the way up here at thirty one thousand eight hundred dollar range
smash up the like button if you enjoyed the content, because if not, i am going to stop youtube right away
if i don't get any support from you guys, i know the people that are watching are giving a lot of su support
where's russell? guys? i'm focusing more on bitcoin than on other altcoins
i obviously take a look at the s p 500 if it's looking bearish or bullish to give me, you know, um, you know, give me confidence with bitcoin trading, of course

we are getting this reaction from this 32 000 range that we have been talking about since we were trading at this 29 000 area
now you want to know, is it time too long? is it time to short? where is the price of bitcoin going? well, i'm going to show you the most important levels and what needs to confirm in the price action to know where exactly we could go in the next coming hours and days
we're also taking a look at this fractal that did happen in december of 2021, very similar price action
ta on bitcoin crypto, also to live streams to connect with a community
because what i want to show you here is that we are getting this reaction from this level
now, what could happen in the next coming hours for bitcoin? well, nobody knows
but if we do start pumping here in the coming hours, and finally we do get rejected from this high that we did create, i am still kind of waiting patiently from this scenario here, because we do have this last lower high, which is at the 326 k levels, this last wick over here, that could be touched and then potentially get a rejection
this is the moment that i will be quite bearish from the bitcoin price
okay? waiting for that reaction patiently, because this might just be a bullish consolidation, ready to have that next explosive move i am very, very patient to wait for the price action to see what is going to do to jump in a trade
now, what is the most important level? well, if i zoom out here, like i showed you, is that 326 k level
of course, you could already kind of short this range if you are using a very small position, add up to your position if you get that leg up to 326 and start getting that rejection
i mean, this is always up to the trader, okay? all depending on how you're willing to risk, or depending on how you're willing to trade
now, if i take a look at fibonacci level from this high, from the start of the drop of the 4th of may, we were talking about the 50 fibonacci retracement that hasn't been reached just yet
it is also to the exact dollar from this high that we did create on the 10th of may
if you do get that kind of price action, you are getting rejected from a very important level, this major wick over here, for that kind of liquidity grab also hitting, you know, the 50 fibonacci retracement
we've also got, you know, this major resistance zone, a lot of wicks from this range
if we have another leg up, and we do get rejected from the 326, in my personal opinion, it is very likely that the price of bitcoin will be coming back down, okay, potentially to 30 000, 29 000, and even to lower levels
this is something that we need to analyze in the next coming days, of course, once we see that kind of price action
so that would be the kind of bearish case scenario, finally getting rejected from this major range
we need still confirmation, in my personal opinion, to hit the point 50 fibonacci retracement from this level, and the last wick that we did create here, to see that rejection, see that reaction
let's talk about what could happen if the bitcoin price, you know, does actually retrace from this range
and i just want to talk about the strongest support level that we do have below us
the biggest level is, in doubt, in my mind, the 30 500 range, where we did have many touches here as resistance
you short, you short of these, all of these levels over here, you know, you were, you were in massive, big profits
so what happens, you know, if we do retest it as resistance? you can see we did get that, get this reject reaction, sorry, from this level
as soon as we broke this lower high trend line that we were talking about, we got the reaction here, looking for that next leg up
so if the price of btc does come down to retest the thirty thousand, six hundred, thirty thousand, five, 500, okay, there could be a little bit of volatility a couple of weeks there
it is very likely, in my personal opinion, that you should be getting a shortterm bounce at least to the 618, from the high to the low here, to potentially create a lower high, or potentially create a double top
all right? if we start pumping from this level, i want to see a reaction
i want to see that reaction from the 618, the double top, okay? and then potentially enter a short position, of course
so then, you know, then i am conf you know, this is confirming that we are creating that double top, that the price action
okay, the balls are getting exhausted, and we're going to go to lower levels
till that happens, i will not be extremely bearish, of course
okay, i'm waiting patiently to see what happens in the next coming hours
so what if we do come down to this range? like i said, it is very, very possible that we get that balance
apart from this resistance range, we can see that we do have a pretty nice spike in volume here
it's not the most, it's not the biggest range, but it's already showing you a bit of bullishness, all right, from this pump
and also, if we take a look at fibonacci retro levels, from the lows here to the highs, you know, you would be hitting that 382
382 is, you know, a good level where you could get a shortterm bounce
all right, so it's the 382, it's the major, okay, level here of resistance that should be turning into support
as you can see, we've got two value area highs from the volume traded from the last, you know, 20 to 25 days
one is at the 32 000 range, and one is at the 30 500 as you can see here
and then we need to see if we're going to create a double top or a slightly lower high for potential continuation to the downside
if this does happen, it will be looking, it will be looking very, very bearish

i got full video tutorials of these platforms also down below in the description
this is super important, because the similarities here are quite scary
and this could tell us that, you know, maybe if we do get this rejection from this level, the price of bitcoin is going to go to much, much lower levels
okay, so this is december here, in the left, december of 2021
i did explain this a few videos back, okay, where we did have a pretty aggressive drop, and we created a lower high, very important
but we do have a lower high, very important level here that we have been talking about to get that reaction from this level
and as you can see, we were creating lower highs back in december here, lower highs
same similarities on bitcoin, right over here, lower highs every single time
this was, you know, 13th of december, 18th of december of 2021
bitcoin was also creating a base here just a few days ago, right at the 28 600 that we've been talking about for a long, long time
so a descending triangle, which is usually a kind of a bearish pattern
this was a confirmation for me to have that potential bounce on bitcoin
so what did happen here? in december of 2021, we did get break out of this trend line, okay, created another, uh, another resistance range here
we did break the trend line here, get a small consolidation from this resistance line and then finally break it
okay, let me just get a little bit of drawing out of the way and show you, you know, this major level, the kind of last lower high okay, approximately from the resistance trend line, round about this range where we are getting this consolidation
you did get that reaction finally breaking above and hitting the last lower high range
so if the price bitcoin, you know that, we do know that this is a very strong level on bitcoin, the thirty thousand five hundred dollars, you know, we can see how we got rejected, and as soon as we came back down to retest this level, you know, we did get that balance
so, i mean, this doesn't mean it needs to happen because it happened here
we have, we have had seen, you know, the confluence that i've just showed you a few minutes ago from the thirty thousand five hundred dollar level
so if we do come down here, i do think that we are gonna expect a balance, because it's just a strong level
this is why we need to learn how to have good risk management and protect our positions at all cost
so, you know, this scenario is very, very possible, getting a potential balance
you know, as soon as we do get that bounce, if we were to come down to the 30 500 range, it will be very interesting to see how we're going to react, how that balance is going to react again at this 32 000 range, are we going to create a lower high? are we going to create a double top? are we going to manage to break resistance? you know, that will be a critical moment to decide if it's going to be good to potentially short the price of bitcoin, of course
um, so, yeah, just stay cautious with your trading at all cost, of course
you created a double top swing failure pattern right over here
you did get a little bit of a reaction here from the lower high trend line and then continued back down
is this possible for bitcoin? all right, well, we could get a bounce the price action, okay, the bullish price action is potentially going to get exhausted, and then you're finally going to break here the one of the most important support levels that we do have right now, which is the 30 500 brake support range, and potentially continue to the downside
check out the bitcoin center website for the latest news and technical analysis ideas
and just to discord too, just one second, guys, i cannot see anything
as always, i need to give the community the content first of all, they appear now
jesse and diana, george, smoking joe, richard, annelie, hello, i am great
if you haven't liked live stream, please go inside and do that right away
hello, isabel, how are you? dj mccoy, i don't even know how to pronounce that, but i hope you're good
i will not take a position either until we break certain levels
and that is obviously something that we will go through in today's live stream
um, two different levels that i can use is to see if we have a pullback to the upside when it comes to bitcoin
and this was something that we spoke about in this morning live stream
and that, of course, makes sense when the market on bitcoin is moving to the downside, right? so we are very bullish when it comes to, you to to the dollar um makes sense because we came back down, and we did retest the 50 of the fibonacci, of this fibonacci that i do have from the 15, no, sorry, from the weekly chart
so we just connect the dots with each other, a very volatile candlestick that we did have last week
and now you can see, let's see how this baby will behave against this resistance supports
okay, so we can definitely see the market pull back up on dxi to, uh, 103037, potentially zero point at 103453
i want to see how the market behaves around that level though, but i definitely believe that we will have a bigger pullback
but on the lower time frames, we can find better entries, or i can, because i'm no financial advisor, so just give me a few seconds before because this is really important
so we are about to go back down? uh, pull back down to the 50
and this is, on the higher time frames, a fibonacci that we've been taking from the 12 hourly chart
so this morning, if you were not on my morning live stream, would would they speak about this one? yo
if andy says, the market goes up and me down, you're going to be so confused
so looking at the 12 hourly chart, we do, i did drag a fibonacci from 36 090 and back down and back down to the support at 25 240
that gives us fibonacci levels that we are right now inside, after 1 925 and 30, 30 675
we did break this resistance trend line a couple of days ago, but that doesn't mean that the market cannot have a momentum back down again
if you're new to the channel, you know that i do believe that bitcoin will come back down to 25 300
so this could definitely be a momentum, a momentum back down to the support
because if you also connect it with the xi, if we want the market to pull back up to these levels and then see the market potentially reverse back down, that's gonna happen on bitcoin too
but to the opposite, you'll see the market pull back down, and then we can pull back up again
um, but whatever can happen, obviously, so we'll just try to follow it
but right now we are inside the fibonacci levels where we do expect the market to reverse back down
so on the lower time frames, we have an important level right here that we are right now trying to retest, okay? um, and that is 31, 30 thousand three hundred and thirty and thirty one thousand two hundred and thirty
so we can see the market either you see the, uh, the break to the upside, and then you see the market pull back up to potentially 31 800
or if we only see this as a okay, so we can also pull back up to, if we don't respect the levels that we are retesting at the moment, this previous report that we did break, we could see us come come back up and retest 31 470, potentially 31 550
i do expect the market to drop um, all right? i mean, even if we see the market potentially come back down and see the uh, a continuation to the upside, i definitely believe that we will pull back down to the fifty percent at thirty thousand six hundred 650
if i would go into a position on a special a cell, i would want the market to have a little bit more momentum to the downside
and on the higher time frames, that's usually how i want it to be, is that i see a pullback when the market creates the lower high, doesn't matter where it is
if the market doesn't give us a pullback on the higher time frames, i will go into the lower time frames and do the exact same thing
i would drag a fibonacci from the from a last high to the low
or i will look at previous support and resistance zones that the market on the lower time frames give
he went on a live stream before me, and i think that he will end it soon
oh, can you see how perfectly this is? i would not be surprised if we come back up and retest 31473
so if we see the market coming up to this level during the live stream, that would be so amazing to see, if we actually see the market retesting it, and then you see the drop, because that is usually what happens when the market drops from a fibonacci level like this
but we can see that right now we are retesting the support at 31 226
this is the low from yesterday's new york july in new york session
it is new york session, so remember, i have, i don't know if i've, i've been talking about this before, but sessions respect sessions
so, yeah, i'm just gonna wait for the market to pull back up on ethereum, and then we just, i just might see the mark, you know, find a good entry
now, when the market moves the way it does, we go to ethereum
i'm not sure what andy says right now, but if we say two different things, i do apologize
but when it comes to both of us, we just, you know, share our thoughts, nothing more than that
so we're either me and andy are financial advisors, so always remember that
we are right now retesting this previous report that we did break on the weekly chart
if we see that this candlestick, these candlestick, if we close below 1890 and you see recess from below, the market is definitely going down
i know that it's always probabilities, but i definitely believe that because we came back up to the previous resistance that we did have before we connected us with each other
if we're closing below it, that just means that the market doesn't have the power to break a weekly support right here, as you can see
um, doesn't mean that we're gonna continue down forever, but for me, it definitely means that we can come back down to the support again around 1 600 or 700
that is definitely the first target that i see on ethereum, um, looking at the lower time frames, we also saw the market breaking the support trend line
so i'm gonna take a support trendline, i'm gonna put the alert in case we see a quick retest and then another drop
you came back up, retested, the support market goes back, goes down
a bit confusing, but trying to listen of both of you at the same time
well, are you and and a couple, or friends, maybe school? no, we are working for the same company
we're working for the same company, just like you work with your colleagues
yeah, so we, uh, but one thing that we also can have in mind now on ethereum is that we are coming back down to this previous support
so you just might see the bounce back up and then see the drop
so still, for me, waiting game on on ethereum two, waiting game
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can help me reach out to more people, help me grow the channel
so, uh, we can help people to look at the charts in a very, very simple way
because every single morning, as you saw, morning setups bitcoin and crypto, every single morning, 8am, swedish time, one hour before london session, i have morning livestreams where we look at the setups over the day
um, if there's anything that you want to look uh, want me to look at? i can do that
we just, you know, see the overview, go through what happened the day before and what could possibly happen today
so you can go back to these live stream and just sit and back test with me
but i will also have one tomorrow, so you can be part of that too
uh, because i definitely want to help you guys with everything that i've been shaving since 2018, and i have a lot of good knowledge when it comes to to technical analysis, and i definitely want to share that with you guys
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buybacks up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and by bit is super good when it comes to holding your position for a longer time, especially for swing traders, because the fees is so low
now, you know, okay, is there any coins that you want me to look at? i haven't seen anything
you started definitely moved, going to the higher time frames
hey, tomeshu, how are ya? okay, so we are looking at the weekly chart
when it comes to us 30, we tried to break a previous support that we did have around 32 960
and now you can see how the market did not have the power to break that previous support
but what they don't have in mind is that, first of all, we are in a heavily downtrend, heavily downturned
market came back up and tried to break in the support that we did break a couple of weeks ago
market close below now the previous support on the lower time frames, we've already seen
but now we could expect the market to pull back up and retest the support, and then you see the drop
but the last higher law, if we're looking at the the four hourly charts, is at 32 506
if i want to be more sure, i would want to market to break that level
and now we always have to look at where, at least that's how i do it
i look at the candlestick, and i look at the volume of the candlestick
and when the more you practice to read candlestick, you know how the fake out looks
i want the market to give me a pullback, so i will start to see the market actually pulling to the upside
it was only because this morning we had ricardo, ricardo the spammer, and i closed the chat
third, i just want to see another drop, and then, um, see whatever happens
if guys, if you're new to the channel, you can see lauren, my moderator
so you can be part of a very good community, bitcoin census community
so if you want to be with people that love trading as much as you do, or if you're new to it and you want to ask questions, you're more than welcome to be part of that community
i just, you know, found the most beautiful people ever through youtube
so uct oh, it's a long time, raj dies for everyone, or for a lot of people at least
so why i look at this level is because from this level, you did not only have the huge push that, but you also had these three candlesticks
and these three representing together is an evening star against a support
so this level that we do have, between 2587 and 3216, is very strong
so i would definitely, i could definitely see solana pull back down to these levels
and then expect the market, even if you just might not see this happening, but i would definitely see the market giving us a bigger pullback
and then, you know, might come back down to the support or break everything and continue to the upside
but the target that i see solana pull back down to now is, first of all, uh, 32 dollars
this is what i wait for you started to do to bitcoin, to do ethereum, to do the same thing over and over again
what does the market do? can you see? i'm gonna take this fibonacci away
can you see how perfectly the market came back up? we tested it 50 and target one got hit
it should not be anna, is it? can't you write it? no, it took it says one, one second
we, um, i need to get, um, how much back testing needed for this? it's different from everyone
i don't know where you are in your journey, but with the question, i guess you are pretty new, because if you are an experienced trader, you wouldn't ask that, which is totally fine
but i don't know, i don't know how fast you you how fast of a learner you are
what did i miss? everything said, yeah, so we can pull back up to potentially
so usually on on this fibonacci that i do have, usually you can see pull back and the higher low, uh, create it against this fibonacci level
so a pullback could potentially happen against 4425, and they see another drop
can you please tell me how you backstage your strategy? uh, if you go to my youtube channel, you can go to backtest with me, and then you look at these videos, and i i show you exactly how i do it
and tomorrow i will also have a back testing live stream, so you can also crypto p and lp on that one
but tomorrow this time, and five hours from now, five, six hours from now
and now we're heading back down to target one, to potentially 288
can you see? i mean, guys, you've been, you've been looking at me for so long
does it make sense now, for the ones that have been looking at this for so long, i'm, i'm still working on my trading style
i descend, yeah, ever i mean, just because i, you know, how i see the market is in a completely different way to how other people look at the market
you have to practice it so much, you, you know yourself when it comes to trading
so a first target that i can see is coming back down to is, uh, 290
i mean, you could definitely pull back, you you can definitely also see market pull back down to 268 dollars and 250 dollars too
so that is definitely a target where i see b b coming back down to
so this is where i do expect us to come back down to take freight from five point eight hundred and forty six back down to three point eight hundred and seventy four
because the support trend line is representing the pullback to the upside
every single time i do this, every single time, i'm so fascinated how everything is just connected
we could also have taken another trend line, go down to the 15 minute chart
i promise you, i promise you, you will see that this works on the 15 minutes chart too
can you see same thing happening over and over again? market breaks below, comes inside, reads as fifteen sixtyone percent
even if i had a selimet order, i would have my stop loss at least above this high, somewhere here, right? and then you see the drop
so yeah, what happens now? we can definitely pull back down to the support at four four point two hundred and eighty five
because i definitely believe that you slowly, instead will see the market pull back down to these levels and then potentially reverse back up
do you know how much i've been looking at the charts every single day since 2018
that's why when people come and ask me, how long does it take? well, it took me since 2018, so i don't know how long it's gonna take for you, but trust me when i say it will take time, because there's so many things, there's so many things you have to understand when it comes to the charts
and if you cannot practice, don't be angry if it's not working, because it will only work when you practice on it
so many people are talking so many stupid things when it comes to trading, and they disrespect people who sit at the charts 24 7
it will only work if you give if you promise yourself it will work
if you don't promise that, if you don't put down, if you don't put the time to it, you will never be a trader

and tomorrow i will also have a back testing session with you
and it's pretty late, it's pretty late, but if you have the notification, you know, you know
and, uh, yeah, you can just, and if you were crypto trading for beginners, the same thing is kind of like back testing, but with short videos
market structure, part one and part two is definitely the ones that i do recommend, because they are so, so, so, so, so good
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on bibles up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and this is how you are supporting me in bitcoin census by doing that
we go down to the okay? so on the daily you can see that we are, uh, i drag you from 05 5125 back down to the support at 03 311
but now we're using the resistance trend line to see if we are breaking below it
another thing that we could have done for a good entry would drag the fit from last high to the low perfectly
uh, take profit one at zero point four thousand one hundred and twelve
and, yeah, so this is so now we will be inside the fibonacci lev uh, sorry, the trend line at zero point four thousand and fifty five
we can also come back down to zero point four thousand and six, and then you could potentially see another retest of the trend line
even though i'm no financial advisor, so that's what i that's what i see right now, we can go to bitcoin and just do a recap of what's actually okay
okay, what dropping? okay, so we, okay, so this is what i talked about
once you get over the part of letting losing trade sketchy and realize the losing part of the game, you start looking for your next trade and lost turn
and when, when we, when we over leverage is also when you over leverage is usually why the losses is taking it's really taking, uh, like it's painful because we over leverage
just because if you just try to take a trade with the right leverage of what your account actually can take without you actually losing too much money, you will not care about, you will not care about the loss in the same way if you over leverage, the over leverage to trade
so just try, just try a couple of times to not over leverage, and you'll see the change of your emotions when it comes to it
when i, when i started to do that, and my stoploss, you got hit, i was like, well, i don't really don't care
but when i've been, when i've been over leveraged, you know, i want to look at the trade, i get nervous, you know, start to sweat
and then your stoploss is taking and the whole account is gone
how are you? it's not, uh, it's not so much profit and loss, income and expense
okay, so we're just letting the market, letting the market do whatever it's supposed to do
so right now what the market is doing is just giving you the falling knife
and if you don't know what the falling knife, the falling knife in trading is that you never sell or buy a market that goes straight down or straight up
because when if you, if you sell the market now, you will probably have a pullback
you will probably over leverage, because you know that you're not supposed to sell down here
if if that's not your strategy, obviously, if you know what you what you're doing, that's a whole different thing
but if you sell the market here, you see the pullback, you will be in draw down
and then you see the real move happening, and you're like, oh no
i did this this this one more time, like all of the other 10 billion times
it's pretty easy when you talk like that, right? i say it to myself too, but it's not worth it
we're, we're two likes away from 100 people that like to live stream
please help me like the live stream so we can reach out to more people
i actually have, i actually have one eleven thousand and two hundred people that subscribe to my channel
i just wanna say thank you so much guys for supporting me always, because i actually love this
muhammad, because i know how hard trading is, i just, i just want to share my own experiences
and the community that we have on bitcoin census is so beautiful, because we have so many different traders that helps us each other
so if you haven't already subscribed to it, go inside and do that
and just go through my youtube channel, and you'll, you will, you will see
but tomorrow, i will say it again, i will have a back testing live session, uh, tomorrow where i just go through the charts
so we are able to, so we are able to look at the charts in a very um focused way
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in description down below the video
this is how you are supporting me with consensus, because this is how i'm always available for you guys
first time i see video of you, you look and feel way better live than than a picture
she uh, your tia has helped me become a bit sharper in my trades
so when it comes to ada, i'm not sure if we already went through this, but we came up and retested a previous resistance and a previous lower high market never had the power to break that
with this first push down with the lower high, market came back up, retested it
okay? so this is what i when i talk about, uh, when i talk about a fake out, fake out market tried to break this resistance trend line
and this is why it's so important that we know how to use the technical tools, because when we know how to draw the lines, the market will always respect them
can you see how perfectly the market came back up and retested it with this? doji
but on the four hourly when the market closed below, and you see a wick closing below the recipients
like, can you see how perfectly the market retested this line that i do have, just because i know how to connect it with the previous lower high
these two different prices gave us exactly the prices here where the market did retest it
if you want to know more about trend lines, i will recommend you to go down
go down and look at the the live stream that we did have yesterday, because i did explain how to use the trend lines
because trend lines is ninety percent more respected than support and resistance horizontal lines
you can also see that we did have a evening start with this week
but the real, the real entry was when the market closed below retest
so you can have, you can take entries in so many different ways
take profit two as is at zero point, five thousand, five hundred and ninety four
take profit three is zero point, five thousand, three hundred and ninety
at the moment, i would just want the market to do whatever it's supposed to do if it's going to continue to drop
but if we're starting to see the market pulling back up, we'll start our eyes, start to use different uh trend lines or fibonacci levels
but at the moment, you can still see the market continue uh to drop
but the two other uh tren uh take profits that i spoke about is definitely slowly steady, that market can come back down and take okay, we're looking at uh, i'll go for cantero
how are you? thank you for joining okay, so we connect to support with the previous resistance that we did have between 03 390 and zero point, uh, zero point three thousand seven hundred and eighty we did fill this week
um, that this is the week on the on bitcoin that we expected to to film
okay, so if you go to the two daily charts, we came back up and retested the 50 at 04 180
and also zero point four thousand two hundred and eighty seven, go down to the lower time frames
okay, so right now, what we're waiting for, if we are not continuing to drop even more, we could potentially see a pullback up to zero point four thousand one hundred and forty eight
also, uh, zero point four thousand one hundred and seventy pull back and then drop, if that is the case
now remember that if the market now decides to come to these fibonacci levels, you obviously don't to see one huge can green candlestick break above, because that could be that this is only the fake out
so be, even though i'm no financial advisor, but always be very careful when it comes to um when you if you start to see that you have big volatility to the upside these fibonacci levels will not be valid
it's only valid when you see the market pull back up to these levels
and you slowly, instead start to see that market gives you a lot of weeks
looking something like this, right? or something like this, you will see the market giving you bearish reversal patterns inside the fibonacci levels
and i would look, i would combine the higher time frames, uh, candlestick, and see how they are built up on the lower time frames, because that is really important
but if this fibonacci will be valid, take profit one will be to where we are at, slightly above now, at zero point four thousand and eighty
take profit three is at zero point three thousand nine hundred and eight said i did i say take profit two? that was take profit two
and take profit three is zero point three thousand eight hundred and twenty two
uh, um, i just shorted bitcoin head and, uh, should in one hour
um, let's see, should be more subscriber, because you're the best
christian, i don't understand the mathematic meaning in the movement of the grab
i don't know what you talk about when i draw support and resistance
you know why? i actually don't know what you're talking about
to be honest, i'm not saying that you asked me the wrong question
perfectly this is what we wait for the market to do on every candle, uh, every coin that we're looking at at the moment
okay, so the target that i can see us coming back down to is the first target, okay, we you have different targets, but okay, so support around 617, but definitely the the wick at 544
when you see the market drop like this, is called a knife falling
i think i said that, but a knife falling, you never catch an eye falling, because you were cut yourself
if you, if you sell the market when the market is this volatile right now, you will cut your account
you choose to do whatever you want to do, but i would not suggest you to do that
okay, overall, we look at the orb over, uh, over view, and we are coming back down
so expect the drop, but we will try to see where that could be
we can also use this high in case we see the market pull back up a little bit
but okay, so when if we see a pullback, so with some patient the market will eventually pull back up
now, if you see the drop of whatever coin it is, but most of them is moving the exact same way
but when we, when we see the market pull back up, what we're gonna do is, either we use the fibonacci from this high at 0754 back down to that lower low
because the lower low will be created when the pullback starts
only then it is a lower low, because at that point we connect the fibonacci with the last high
you can also use this high around 0740 with that next lower low, but only when you see the market giving you one bullish candlestick, one bullish candlestick, and not while the candlestick is active
it has to close like a bullish candlestick, nothing else than that
because if you, if you see the market pull back up, and you're like, yeah, i can put a fibonacci on it now
connect the fibonacci from the last high, or this high, at 0740, with that low, the market will give you the fibonacci level 16 and 51
usually that is when where the market is retesting for the drop
it is a demand zone because from this candlestick, you saw this huge push to the upside
so i want to take it from the close of the body and the open of the body
going to the lower time frames, you can see how beautifully the market came back and came back up and retested this level
what we also can do is that which drag a trendline, connect dots like this
so on, uh, below nine dollars, and you see a potential read test against the the resistance trend line
if we close below it, that is definitely a sign that we can pull back down
so, yeah, as i told you, break below nine dollars, we could also use a fibonacci if that is the case, from one of the highs, this high at 1070, or around 10 with the low, because the market will create a low, pull back up, retest
okay, so last time we were looking at koda, we we spoke about these fibonacci levels that we did retest today, not a couple of days ago, beautifully
okay, so we dragged the fibonacci from two point four thousand six hundred four thousand seven hundred and sixty four
okay, so previous prices, but fibonacci was really good at it
but obviously you'll see the market come back down to the support again, first of all, at 217
i don't know how far the market will go before you create the pullback
so i actually don't have anything at the moment when it looks, uh, when i look at korea, but definitely i do believe that we can come back down to one point eight thousand five hundred and fifty
go to the higher time frames for a perspective of what's actually going on
so on the weekly chart, what i did was, when you see a a huge break like this, and we connected with the previous resistance, where you've seen the market hold it acid resistance for a couple of times
you start it's the resistance started here around february 2001
what happens? you see the retest of the exact same level that we tried to break before
so i dragged the vape from two point six hundred and seventy four back down to one point eight hundred and five
just for us to make sure that we understand what we look at another entry
can you see how perfectly retest take profit one just got hit? it's amazing how it works
and we always need to practice it, because that's how we that's how we can be more secure when we enter the trade
i always have my, i always, in this case, have my sell limit order at the 50 or 618 percent
i usually take it now from the 50, because the 50 is usually more retested than the than the 60
it really sucks when you have your sell limit order at the 618 percent
and you saw, the market only came back up and retested the 50
and when the distance between the 15 and 61 isn't that big, you can see it's a bigger difference between, uh, this 50 and the 60 than on the lower time frames
so that is why i don't care so much if i will be, even if the market comes back up and retest the 618, i don't cry about being in a little bit of drawdown
whenever you say sniper, i remember the swag academy guy, who was that? i don't know
take profit two is add one point and nine hundred and twenty eight
and take profit three at the support at one point eight hundred
so that is what i see right now on cosi and knc, sorry, i started to talk swedish
bryce breeze, oh, okay, i will not make, okay, i will, i will not do a a technical analyze on a chart looking like this
um, then the web guy, did we look at avox already? he has some sniper entry forks videos
as you guys know, the first target that i believe that we can come back down to is 21, because that is the end
and if you just connect the dots with each other, you can already see that the market came back up and retested the 50
market came back up and did the exact same thing that we always want the market to do
maybe you should have a live stream tomorrow and show everyone what you went through
like yesterday, i counted bars and predicted this dump within 30 minutes
okay, so looking at ava, sorry, market created high highs and high lows
you saw the reverse, back down, going to the lower time frames
i usually use my fibonacci against the bodies, but sometimes i can use it to the wick too
and as you see, market came up exactly and retested from this low, pull back up to 7 2733
but take profit two is at 2390, and take profit three is at 2266
and c so some of the pairs that i know that we've been through is a lot solana magic, all go
so you can go back to the live stream if you want to and see it
but we're gonna look at anc now and look at, look at the overall picture
we can come back down to potentially zero point, seven thousand six hundred and three, if we want to be precisely
but this previous support at, okay, nine thousand, three hundred and ten
but by just trying to understand what we look at, i dragged the food from 37 hundred back down to two twenty thousand into market, pull back up to these levels
but we are about to reach down to target one at sixteen thousand one hundred and twenty
take profit two is exactly combined with the support at seven thousand four hundred and fourteen
like, let's say you have a head and shoulder pattern, or bart simpson pattern
you look at the left and look at if it's symmetrical, then find ah, i need to start to use my brain again, jerome
for that, i need to see it with my own eyes for me to be able to understand it
but that's definitely great, something that i would look into
guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you guys can help me to reach out to more people
let us help other people, uh, to show them how easy it can be to look at the charts for free
if you haven't already done that, you scroll down, this is how it looks
back test with me if you don't have anything to do tonight, and if you want to back test with me, uh, going to these ones
uh, yesterday we did have a live stream about trend lines, where i went through exactly how i use the trend lines
i also have a crypto trading for beginners, where you can go into market structure, part one and part two
i always recommend these ones, because market structure is how the market is built
the market is built with highs and higher lows, lower lows, low highs in sideways market
and if you don't understand the concept of market structure, it would be very hard for you to trade the market
when you, when you practice this, trust me when i say that you will start to see the market in a whole different way
and i always suggest to start with the higher time frames, because the higher time frames is showing you the direction, and the lower time frames is giving you the entries
so if you haven't already subscribed to it, because tomorrow we will also have a london session live stream
this is where we go through the charts together before the whole day starts
i already had the setups this morning because we were looking at the charts together
and just put that in a as a routine, to look at the charts before the whole movement
so the market wasn't that fun this day, uh, during the day, until we now saw this huge, uh, break, right? and we are right now, we are right now breaking, or trying to break the 50 that we do have on this fibonacci, where i did expect the market to reverse back down from
i am not in a cell position at the moment um, because, you you saw the market just drop, um
if we drag the fibonacci on bitcoin from 32 133 back down to 31 350
and we're about to hit he take profit three at thirty thousand three hundred and seventy two
so really good, really good take profits when it comes to to this fibonacci
so, as you can see now, we're coming back down and retest a previous higher low that we can see on the four outlet chart
and if we break this level, i will look at where the potential next lower high can be
but i will, i think i will use the that on the lower time frames, we just might need to use this, uh, little lower high drag the fib to where you can see the mark when the market starts to pull back up
so we drag it from potentially at that point at 31, 150, back down to where the market starts to pull back up
and that gives us fibonacci levels where the market can come up and retest for then give me another entry to to sell the market and then see the continuation of the drop
don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and if you are a swing trader, this is really good for you, because when when it comes to holding your positions for a longer time, vibe, it gives you so good fees when it comes to that
so one second, if you want to be part of my community that i have on bitcoin census, the greatest community ever
uh, just one second, i will give you the chat in the chat so you can be part of our community
you can see that i i just, uh, gave you the telegram group where you can join
and on this group, we talk about cryptocurrencies every single day, and we show each other our thoughts about it
this is only for us to be able to connect with each other, talk about trading, or just, you know, talk about not anything
so many people have found themselves, like some people like, oh, you're from spain
so you can definitely meet people that you would never know that you were supposed to meet through this community
it's so amazing to see how people connect with each other, and especially with the same passion that you guys have
so you can definitely be in that community, chat with me how to join the group
how are you? and remember the chat that i do have everyone, i say everyone is polite to each other, because there's so many people with different opinions
we're in our different journeys, and this is just where you connect
this is where you just connect with each other and have a good time
i don't think we will see a good level to sell the market pretty not not at the moment
i think it's gonna take a couple of hours or so, depends on how it looks on the lower time frames though, i saw someone wanted me to look at rose
i don't know who wanted me to look at it, but what we're gonna do is that we're gonna use this previous demand zone, as you can see
so from this candlestick, you saw the market push right back up
and we can use this one if if we see the market, uh, if we see the market having a bigger pullback, so we can come back up and retest ten thousand four hundred and ninety, looking at the daily we're just trying to connect everything
so we drag fib from 8699 back down to the support at 612, going to the lower time frames
it's just like you're just doing the routine, nothing more than that
i mean, i do back test, but i don't back test the same way that i did before
but okay, so let's say, okay, so 15 minutes is, uh, 30 minutes, candle is it better? now? so we drag a fibonacci, but everything depends on how this candlestick is closing, but drag fibonacci from 7652 back down to 7160, only if you see that the market give give you this pullback now
so that could take us back up to potentially, uh, 747, 4460 for a potential continuation to the downside
if this is the case, i am no financial advisor, but take profit one is 7050
what country do you live in? i live in sweden, darling, i live in sweden
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people

and i just might also find some entries even though i'm no financial advisor
i don't know where you, where you're from, um, but be with me on the london session, because you can learn so much, even if you don't want to take any setups
it's about us just going through the charts, give everyone the levels to what potentially the market can do against them
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you supporting me and the consensus by doing that
if you are a swing trader, this platform is really good for you, because the longer positions that we hold, the lower fees, is very good when it comes to that
uh, have you studied anything? uh, what have you done for job before trading? i was a flight attendant
i remember i was a flight detention attendant when i started to study the charts at 2018
i wish everyone a super great night day morning, wherever you are in the world
if you did like it, i'm glad i found your breath of fresh air
11, i'm so happy that i have so many good people looking at me
my dream was to have a community and trade with people, at least show everyone what i was doing
when it comes to trading, you can do that because you want to ask smart people what they did wrong
so you were not supposed to do the same things, right? okay, oh, ralph
so he's been, he has been with me on my journey since day one
but just one second, guys, if there's anyone on here, i'm just gonna give out the content
how are you? just one second, i'm just gonna turn off my phone
hello guys, how are you? if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
how are you guys? how are you? i hope everyone is feeling great this morning
um, i hope i think you guys like the back testing session that i did have yesterday, because it is already 1 300 people that watched it
do you guys, if you were on my, uh, back testing live stream yesterday, please write in a chat if you liked it or not? did did you learn something? uh, for the people that's new, um, on this channel
yesterday i did have a back testing live session about trend lines
if you go down to my, my page, you can see that i, i need to, i need to change it to that back testing
but a back test with me, this is where i go through and to show you exactly what i see myself
and we have like, a little time where i show you what i what i see, and i just try to teach you
uh, also, quick, don't forget that you can also receive a bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so you guys know, um, smoking joe, he went to bed without telling me
things different but it while sleeping? oh, thomas, that's totally fine
okay, let's see, today it's gonna be a crazy day on um, on us usd because we have multiple, we actually have some news coming out this morning
uh, so today, you see, we have, we do have a lot of news coming out today
so in a couple of hours, uh, we will probably see the market being very volatile
and so usually when the market is very volatile, um, when it comes to this is just how i've been noticed since i, you know, been doing it since 2018
so when it comes to news, usually the market is going against the trend
so when the news are, um, when the news are coming out, if we are in a downtrend, you usually see the market, you know, have a momentum to the upside, right? then it obviously depends on what type of news
and if we are not in a trade, or if i am not in a trade, uh, at the moment, let's say that let's say that i sell the market right here, right? and then market goes down, and i'm like, yes, then this happened, because the news is coming out, and it takes away everything, all everyone's stop losses, etc
because if you sell the market right here, you usually have like a stop loss around here
you i mean, you can also have it here, but it's pretty far away
um, and then news comes out, and then it goes back to the right, and then it goes to the right direction
so i'm not, i'm not saying this that this was a news setup, but this is usually what the market is doing
um, so if you're not used to trading the, if you're not used to trading the the fundamentals, i would suggest to stay out, because it's really, it can, it can be very volatile
so if we see, okay, so we can see that we are, we are clearly in a dungeon
but we came back down to support on btc a couple of days ago, or we wouldn't have
so if we see a bigger momentum, let's say, if the news comes out today, and we see a bigger momentum to the upside um, we can definitely see market pull back up to 34, 230 and 30
okay? i don't think the market will be that volatile, but this is definitely targets that we overall, can look at to see if we have a momentum now, uh, these are definite levels, around 36 100
we can come back, come back up to these levels, uh, with time
so we just might, in the future now, see the market bouncing between this support and this resistance, until, you know, which we we decide to, okay? are we continuing up now? do we break the the downtrend, create the uptrend, or are we actually continuing down? right? so no one actually really knows
but, um, we can definitely see the market being going sideways
so if we come back up to the support, i just dragged it down, i just dragged down the support to this low
so i would not be surprised if we have the market pulling back up to the resistance and on the so this is the daily charts on the week, on the on the lower time frames, this is where we try to figure out what what's actually going on
and if we just use the trend line that we did have yesterday, the market did break the resistance trend line and we had this huge push to the upside, we can drag fibonacci from the last higher low at 30 593 to the high at, uh, 32 020
but i would not be surprised if we see a push back down to potentially 31 310 and thirty one thousand one hundred and forty five for a a maybe just a quick pullback or retest
and then when the news comes out, it could be the push, like it can help us push to these targets
uh, i definitely, i don't want to say too much, but i definitely have a feeling that we will, we will continue to be bullish a couple of days
and on the lower time frames, it's so many different things that happens
we're going through, uh, cryptocurrencies, and we'll also go through some index pairs
now, everyone, if you didn't know, you know that usd we do have a lot of news coming out today
so if you there is something new, and you'll see in a couple of hours
um, probably doesn't have to happen, but usually that happens is that when you have the red boxes like this, this is the first factor, is the the page that i look at when it comes to, uh, just looking at the overall, what kind of news would you we do have and, uh, and tomorrow we also, i have on thursday, uh, early in the morning, but i don't know how much it's gonna affect the market
but we do have two, uh, we do have two red um news coming out today, alberts think we're going down
and if if you see the market having a push to the upside, that is the that, i mean, they just push it
so it's a fake move, because the overall the market is going down
if if i'm not sure how the market's gonna react to it, i'm just choosing not to go into a trade
i'm just waiting for the market to, you know, have the fake out, the whatever it's supposed to do, and then i take the decisions
because at the moment, i mean, we can, obviously, yeah, i would just wait for myself, i would just wait
but we can go to the dallas, because this one will be the one that's affecting
what i did before was that i took a fibonacci from the low at 98557 to the high at 104 because you can see the overall, overall, the market is in a option
and you can see that we saw the market on the xi go down, and on bitcoin, this is when we've seen the market go up, right? so they correlate against each other most of the time
um, and looking at the lower time frames, when it comes to dxi, we can go to the 12 hourly chart
um, we did break this resistance trendline after we came back down and retested the 50
now what, uh, what i need the market to do for me to be a little bit more sure that we're actually continuing up
we need to break this level, create a high high, a higher low, around the previous lower high, and then, um, the uh, the continuation, um, to the upside
that spends hours giving us free ta, it takes us three seconds to like the stream
guys, if you have not already liked the the live stream, please go inside and do that
so just like you, when you find my channel, um, and most of you are pretty happy about that
so she's 100, right? i actually got gave out so many good things to you
so previous support can become a new resistance if we have a bigger push, push, if we have a bigger push to the outside
i strongly still believe that we will have, we came back down to the support
and it's just like, i just have a feeling that we will continue back up
sometimes the feelings is actually the right guidance, you know, because kind of need to go up, but the market doesn't care if i wanted to go up or not
so that is why we're using the technical tools, right? so what i did was that i connected the dots with the trend line
but one of the things, just because we're retesting a trend line, we still have to remember that we came back down to a very strong, very strong support
market came back down, fill the wick, and now you see the momentum, uh, to the upside
so if we see, we you can see the market pull back down a little bit more, and then slowly, instead of break, uh, to the upside, right? if this is the case, if we just combine it with what we see on bitcoin, we could probably, so this is long term, but 2 36 and 2 480, if this happens, right? but if we see on the lower time frames, okay? which? okay? so we're just trying to connect the dots, right? we're trying to connect that
so if we see the market creating a higher low what we're gonna do is that would drag fib from 1704, 1784 to the high at 1995
we have the 618 percent slightly below, uh, the support at 1866
and the 50 is exactly combined with this box that i have at 1910
so we can definitely pl the market, can definitely play around here before you see the market, if we see the market now move to the upside
but another thing that we also need to have in mind is that if the market break this level and you see retest, and you can see that on the lower timeframes the market doesn't have the power to break above, that could be when you see the market, uh, being bearish instead
so that is why it's really important that we know that we can definitely pull back down to these fibonacci levels
we can see the market creating a high low slowly, instead of break to the upside
but as i just said, but i need to repeat myself, if we see the market break below, you see a retest from below, the market is potentially going down
so some people try to be, you know, fun, fun when they, when i show them the charts, and they're like, yeah, so you mean the market can go up and down? what you don't understand is the most important thing is that you know exactly where the levels are
you know, you you need to know how candlestick is, how what they're actually telling you, because the market goes up and the market goes down
we try to figure out, is it going up or down? right? and that is why these levels are so important
me and tumescu were talking about us 30 yesterday, i saw the market
and this was something that i spoke about on yesterday's live stream, a morning livestream
if we saw the break of this level, or was it like this? what? let's see
and this is the best thing that i can talk to you guys about this
so, uh, to measure also, i think he sold the market around, uh, 33 080
if you didn't know who he is, and maybe he's on here, but i don't know
but it was fun to talk about that, because we spoke about it in the morning live stream
um, okay, so looking at the overall, when it comes to, i'm gonna take these all the way too
um, so when we're looking at the overall at the moment, uh, what i did was that, you know, just, we need to follow the trend, right? um, so i dragged the fibonacci from 34 872 back down to the low at 31 280 market pull back up to these levels
the fibo notch is connected with the previous, uh, previous support that would break go down to the lower time frames
now, okay, we're just going to take this one away, because it's too messy
so we are inside the fibonacci levels where we saw the market
market broke the support trendline, but the last higher low is technically 32 560
market also came back down and created another higher low around 32 885
so that is the same thing that if we have the news, use 30 is very effective when it comes to news
you can see very, very, very, very a lot of volatility when it comes to us 30
um, so i wouldn't do anything at the moment on on us30 until we break the previous higher low at 32 562
break it, and then i'm looking for the lower high, and then i sell the market because that because that will give me more confidence that we're actually going down
and this is something that we spoke about on yesterday back testing live stream, is that the setups look so good when we're back tested
and it can be like that, but it's not that good because we don't have the patience to wait for the market to break certain levels or reach a certain levels
and that is why, when we back tested, it looks so good, but when we do it in real life, it's shitty, because we don't have the patience to do, to wait for it
i mean, when we look at the charts, we're when we look at the charts, at least what i've, what i've learned is that just have the setups, let the market do whatever it's supposed to do, and then continue with your life
but looking at the daily two we have this week, we do have this week, we almost did close below
i'm gonna take this one because the market usually comes back down
market usually comes back down even and fill the wick that we do have here
so don't be surprised if you see the market reverse back down to 32 740
can almost come back down all also come also, oh my god, we can also come back down and retest 32 560
and that is why it's so important for us to look at this previous high low, is because you can see the market pull back up to the back down to this level
and then you slowly and steady see the market reverse back up
and then you see the market creating the higher high and push back up to these higher time frames levels
and then you see the huge drop that we did expect the market to do
but if we're not patient enough, we think that the drop will happen here, even if the market is not giving us the sign that it will happen around these levels, because we're so blind that we just want to jump into the charts right away
you know that, okay, i know that if we break this high along, this is where i start to look at self positions
but as long as we're above that high low, you can create a higher low and see another push back up
that is my security when it comes to taking trades, is that i don't jump into a shade just because i think
okay, let's see, is there anything else that you guys want me to look at while we while we are on the charts, i hope everyone is feeling good
my name is natalie, we do these morning live streams every single day from monday to friday

you can also receive a bonus on bibles up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
so i'm always available for you and buybit is a super great platform if you want to hold your positions as a swing trader for a longer time
and that's beautiful when it comes to private hey, natalie, sorry, i'm late
hello natalie pond, is that a cryptocurrency? i hope you had a good holiday this past weekend
if we have a push, i don't know anything about this, but we can definitely have a push if the market now pulls back up, the same thing that we can see on bitcoin, but zero point two thousand seven hundred and seventy some 800 around that level, this is the previous support, can come back up to create a resistance
but, yeah, i mean, it's really hard when when it comes to cryptocurrencies like this, um
but as i told you, we don't have, we don't have so much to use more than
if we have a pullback, if we have a bigger pullback, we can come back up to zero points, uh, 22 600 and 800, 7 800
and from this level, if we come back, pull back up, you can see the market drop again, or close above and retest, and then see the market being bullish again
i'm not sure if this is gonna happen, but this is what i see right now in the chart
i don't know if you took this trade, but guys, this is so beautiful
can you see? like this is how we connect the dots with the higher time frame
we dragged the fibonacci from the last lower high on the daily chart to the lower low
when we back test, we know in our head that the market is supposed to come back up to these fibonacci levels for a pullback
so we go down to the lower time frames, and when you see the break of structure, and you know that this is the level that we need to pull back up to, what we do is that we connect the dots with a higher low
and can you see how perfectly this was? market came back down exactly to my fibonacci levels, target one, like we had one, and target two
but we know that inside, from the um inside this, six to one, uh, sixty one point eight percent
and the support trend line as the 50 market came back up, retested
and now you see the rejections, and this is where we do expect the market to pull back down from
you can also see how the market perfectly came back up and retested the previous report
so this is just how we connect the dots with each other all the time
i mean, this is beaut this is how the market does all the time
i'm always, always, always fascinated how how you can just connect everything together
how are you? okay, so let's see what we can what happens now? um, we dragged the support trend line, and we saw the break of structure
what did we go through this yesterday? this is happening all the time
okay, so what do we do now? we know that we are inside a fibonacci level, but the most important thing is that we also take the advantage of this high
these two candlestick is representing a fakeout, because we tried to break this previous resistance
what happens in breakout retest is break up, retest, continuation to the upside
when the market giving you the fake out from below, like from a support that is in diverted head and shoulder formation, this is the head and shoulder formation
what does the market do? we came back below head and shoulder formation
fake out neckline, mark it, close below, retest the neckline, and we're still below it
so we drag fibonacci now from the from the last lower high at 119, back down to the support at 112
what did the market do? we came back up, retested a 50 percent
so the market is waiting for, you know, either we have this huge breakthrough upside, or we have this huge drop by following what the market is giving us
but because we have the news coming out today, we can see the market break above it
we just might potentially see a retest at 118, and then see the the uh, and then see the market break to the downside
and i mean, we can also, if the market is respecting these fibonacci levels, we can still come back up to 128 and then see the market reverse back down
so i would be a little bit careful right now, because what we see at the market, what we look at market is just consolidating
and it collects power now to potentially have, you know, continue up a little bit more, or, you see the market just break down
so it's really important, yes, guys, if you want to be part of a bitcoin census community, natalie, because i do have a telegram group where i have close contact with my, my subscribers, and i do really appreciate that lauren just put in the chat, in the live chat
so if you want to be part of that and have a closer relationship to me, um, in the chat and with other beautiful people, we got so many good traders
this is for everyone, as long as you are polite to each other, because everyone sees the market in different ways, ways
one very important thing is that this is where we share our thoughts
this is where we share our thoughts, and you are more than welcome to share yours, but with respect
so right now i would just wait, uh, on aave it looks like, yeah
if we pull back up to 116, and you start to see that, okay, the market doesn't have the power to break it
if we're closing above it, if you see the break, retest from above
we just might come back up and have to retest 128, but it's hard to tell
ma'am um, i don't know where you are in your journey, but on my youtube channel, i don't go through basic, basic, i don't go through basic basics
so you need to understand basic, because i do more um, advanced
if we're looking at chain link, what we do is that, uh, market created a support
looks the same as on bitcoin, obviously created a support market
um, i took a fibonacci on the highest time frames from the last high to the low, which gives me, okay, so we we are
we have a previous support at ten point ninety dollars, fibonacci between 12 and points 19 and 1360
where we are right now, breaking the resistance trend line on the daily chart
so what we can do now, if we okay, so, um, we also have a very strong level at 770 and 810
this is where we could also potentially see the market breakdown
so remember that in a sideways market, you come up to the resistance, come back down to the support, etc, or come back down half of the of the uh range market go back down
so we need to make we need to, we need to understand that the last high low is also combined with where this fibonacci level is, where you can see the market reverse back down
if you break eight dollars, comes back up to create a high low
that could be the the push that we will see to these to these levels, um
so you'll if this is the case, you'll see the market being very bullish
but we we still have to have in our mind that this could actually be where the market is also breaking down, right? so just because we have the news coming out, that doesn't mean everything will be affected super, super much
you can already see how the market is giving you the re uh, the rejections at the 50
so if we see the market break this supports trend line, and the last high and the last higher low is exactly at seven point four two dollars
if we break c rita's from below, that could be the beginning back down to the support at six
if we break it, retest continuation um, potentially, or you see the market pull back up to this previous lower high mark
so these are the two levels where you can see the market, you know, bouncing between before it takes the decision to either, uh, are we bullish now, or, uh, bearish? good advice
okay, my computer will be slow now because i need to have the charger inside, so i do apologize about that
when it comes to computers, i hate it, and especially when it's messy like this
okay, so last time, i don't know exactly, but i think it was a long time ago, we were looking at waves
if you just go back in time, we came back up to the fibonacci levels
we are right now retesting a previous report that would take break
how are you? another thing we drag fibonacci from 1325 back down to the low at 4385
fibonacci levels is exactly combined with the previous support go down to the four hourly, to the one hourly
everything is pretty new when it comes to my computer and everything
do i have to buy new computers every single month because it will get destroyed
isn't it supposed to be like this for i need to have it like, at least, like, a couple of years or so
okay, so looking at waves, we came back up, created high highs and high lows till we came back up to the fibonacci levels, precisely
the last higher low is where on the uptrend the pullback is exactly where we're retesting the market right now, or the where the the price is we're testing at the moment
so technically, if we use the low of the four hourly, oh no, ricardo, stop doing that
guys, when we have these scammers, please don't please don't listen to them
so yeah, we can have a little bit bigger pull back up to, oh, not super big, but, uh, what? eight point seven hundred and sixty five, and not eight point nine hundred and thirty
but we can definitely come back up to these levels and then see the push back down
if we're following market structure, this is what i do expect the market to do
but you can obviously see the market being in a little bit more posted upside, because you can see how volatile the candlestick is when it comes to this
i'm just so fascinates me how i can be so patient when it comes to the charts, but when it comes to computers like this, i have zero patience
do it in front of so many people when you should stay professional
so what we're gonna do is that we're dragging fibonacci from fifteen point four hundred and thirty
we can also potentially come back up to eleven point two hundred and ninety
um, uh, levels if we see the market pushing back up now when we have the news, because the news is just giving us, usually, the fake out
do i need to buy myself a macbook? do i really have to do that? um? [Music], they're so confusing
we can go to gala and the four hourly, but we need to make sure that we understand what we look at
okay, so we did break a previous support as you can see right here
no, ricardo cannot scam us anymore, because he needs to wait for five minutes before you can scam us again
okay, so we can have a push back up on gala, potentially back up to zero point nine thousand and sixty, potentially also, nine thousand seven hundred and fifty
another thing that we can do drag the fibonacci from the last low to the break up structure mark it came back down to
let's see, we can retest, uh, zero point seven thousand eight hundred and thirty eight
potentially zero point seven thousand six hundred and thirty six as a high low in that case
and you can see that take profit one and two is combined with where we can expect the market to then, uh, pull back down
but that just means that we just might have a lower high being created at these levels on the higher time frames and make more sense
and that could be the beginning back down, at least to the support again at 4555
so as i don't have anything at the moment, i just want to see if the market pulls back down, um, to potentially, uh, 7 7820 or 767, push back up to these levels, and then see the reverse
but if the market doesn't respect this as a higher low, and we set the break of the previous low, continuation down
with some patient the market will soon move a little bit, i think
so, yeah, we're just gonna wait and see what's actually gonna happen
so if you guys, if you haven't subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that
um, i do have daily, uh, live streams, morning live streams, every single day from monday to friday, at this time, so we've been having it for about an hour now
i have short videos where i show exactly because some people don't like to be on the, on the live streams
and if you are a beginner in trading, i think there was one girl that asked me about that, but i i do have crypto trading for beginners, uh, when it comes to market structure, part one, part two, really important
i don't know how where you are in your journey, but these are definitely, uh, videos that i would look at, because this is how you connect everything together
and so going to my youtube channel and subscribe to it so you all have the daily updates with me
you can also receive a bonus on bibles up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you're supporting me in the consensus by doing that
if you want to be part of coming the community of bitcoin census and have direct contact with me, you have the link in the live chat
and the only thing that i, i, i expect from you is that you coming to the chat with respect and don't be afraid to ask questions
um, so this chat that i have is for my community, where we support each other
and usually the people are talking with themselves more than i talk
and i was also talking about yesterday that i'm probably going to london in september
so if there's anyone living in london, i know that we have some people, uh, tameshu is one of them, and i we have some other people too
so we're gonna have a meet up if we, if i come to london in september
so this is why it's so great to have a community where we talk with each other and just trying to learn more and more and more
because everyone wants to become a good trader, right? and it's good to have so many people around you that can support you
because if you are at the beginning of your journey, you have so many people that you can talk to that already been there
so when it comes to be a become a good trader, listen to what experience people already had gone through
because it's so not worth the time to go and do stupid things when you can just listen to the people that done these stupid things and just learn from them
are you moving to london or just, no, i'm just visiting london because i will go
he's a very, uh, best artist i've ever you know, i love london, and he lives there
and he's gonna have a, a a, he's gonna sing, and i want to see that
and to meshu and everyone else, have a good welcome back to the critique channel
my name is josh, and right now the price of bitcoin is still perfectly playing out this fractal which is very interesting, because we have also seen a bit of a selloff in the short term over in the stock market due to the federal reserve beginning quantitative tightening today
all of this will be very important to pay attention to, so i'll be covering it later in this video
first of all, giving you a quick update on the monthly bitcoin charts
because, as mentioned yesterday, we just saw a monthly candle close, which confirmed the break into the lower half of the rsi indicator on the monthly bitcoin chart
and we have only ever seen this happen just three other times in bitcoin's entire price history
and all of those three other times turned out to be areas of maximum opportunity if you're simply dollar cost averaging into bitcoin during those stages in the markets
and if you want to know more about this chance right here and when we could possibly begin a bullish reversal back to the upside, then definitely check out my last update video that i posted yesterday on the channel
but basically as of right now, because of the fact that the monthly bitcoin rsi is currently in the lower half of the indicator, i'm simply dollar cost averaging into bitcoin
but keep in mind, we could see some lower prices, because, for example, on this daily bitcoin chart, looking at this bitcoin fractal that we're still playing out, we saw a perfect reversal back to the downside after that pump that we saw over the past few days, which is pretty much exactly what we saw in the middle of last year
because, in case you're new to the channel, these white bars are simply previous price action that i copied from what we saw in the middle of last year, more specifically in around may, june and july
and in fact, during last year, we saw a crash during may, and then a lot of sideways consolidation for the rest of may, leading into june, where we saw a bit of a pump, but we also came back down to meet the original lows that we set during may
and then the bitcoin price chopped around for a little bit more, had one more retest of the lows, and then we recovered back to the upside
and even if you're looking at the daily bitcoin rsi, during may, we entered into oversold territories
and the daily rsi has basically been on an uptrend since then
and we briefly entered into the top half of the rsi, so just above 50
and now we're currently seeing a slight pullback in both the daily rsi and the bitcoin price
and now, looking at what happens during the middle of last year, we entered into oversold territories on the daily bitcoin rsi during may at that massive crash
and then while the bitcoin price was experiencing a lot of choppy, sideways price action for basically the rest of may, entering into early june, we saw an uptrend form on the daily bitcoin rsi
and then we pumped slightly above 50, just above the halfway point in the rsi
and then we saw a pullback in the daily bitcoin rsi, which also resulted in a further pullback in the bitcoin price, which once again revisited the original low that we set back during may
but if you're zooming out to the twoday bitcoin chart, obviously we still have this active bullish divergence right here
and we also saw something very similar on the twoday bitcoin chart back during the middle of last year
but it is important to mention that i don't necessarily expect the exact same thing to play out
instead, i'd expect something similar, just not the exact same if that makes sense
so basically, in the somewhat shorter term, looking over the next one week or so, i wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit more of a pullback in the bitcoin price, as i also mentioned in yesterday's video before this pullback started
but overall, we're potentially in for another one month worth of sideways, choppy price action, relatively speaking
and of course, another reason why we are experiencing a bit of a pullback today in the bitcoin price, which i also discussed in yesterday's video before the pullback, was this bearish divergence forming on the four hour bitcoin charts
and once again, as i mentioned yesterday, this just means that this bullish move is losing bullish momentum
basically, we're gathering more bearish momentum so we're most likely about to see potentially some choppy sideways price action, or potentially a pullback
and at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is clearly trading below 30 700
so as for some other levels of support to pay attention to, obviously we still have important support coming into play at around 28 and a half thousand
but other than that, looking at the fibonacci retracement tour from swing low to swing high on this four hour chart, we do have the golden pocket coming into play at around 29 and a half thousand
so basically in this area on the chart, at around 28 to 29 000, to give or take, there is a lot of buying pressure waiting there
because, once again, we have already seen that over the past few weeks
and also, if the price of bitcoin potentially makes its way back down towards around 29 000, that will bring the 4hour bitcoin rsi close towards oversold territories, especially if we do that in all one move
but if we have a bit of a breather in between, then that could reset the rsi
but for now, in terms of the shorter term trend, i am simply more bearish than bullish
but on the macro picture, looking at these macro signals, technically speaking, we're still in an area of maximum opportunity, according to bitcoin's entire price history
so on the larger time frames, on the big picture, i am still more bullish than bearish for the long term, talking about potentially over a year from now, just like what we saw in 2015 and 2020
and also in 2018, we ended up seeing a lot more bullish price action sooner than the next actual bull market, because we saw a massive bull run of over 300 profits less than half a year away from the end of the bear market, around a few months away
stock market today, this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the fourhour time frame
and the stock market has started off today with a small selloff, and since then we've seen a small bounce back
so overall, on the daily time frame for the nasdaq 100 index, we haven't seen a lot of action in the stock market today
but one of the reasons that potentially promoted that small selloff in the stock market earlier in the trading day, which also spooked crypto prices in the shorter term, what's the fact that the federal reserve has now begun quantitative tightening
as this article says, starting the 1st of june, the fed will begin draining that plus 33 trillion dollars of bank reserves from its nearly nine trillion dollar balance sheet to put all of this money into motion, which is a process called quantitative tightening
and i won't go too deep into this, but basically, quantitative tightening is just a fancy name for removing liquidity from the financial system
so basically removing excess dollars from the system, which is basically the opposite of quantitative easing
and quantitative easing, or qe, for short, is just a fancy name for printing money, basically
and that is what we saw happening a lot during 2020 in particular
because in 2020, and really leading into 2021, we saw a huge expansion of the money supply of us
dollars, as the fed was pumping liquidity, pumping dollars into the financial system in order to stop the financial system and the economy from basically crashing
they're actually causing prices to go down with this quantitative tightening
and the reason why they're forced to do this at the moment is because of inflation
and so by doing this, by removing excess dollars from the system, by removing liquidity, you're essentially aiming to bring down prices to combat inflation
but this also has an effect on market like the stock market, real estate, crypto, all of that
and so it's because of all of that, basically the federal reserve's monetary policy, as to why we've been experiencing a lot of bearish price action this year, especially in both the stock market and in crypto
but even when we are seeing bearish price action, we can still make money in crypto
and if you want to know how to do that, check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen
because both of these videos reveal how you can keep making money in crypto no matter what prices are doing
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
