uh, the last couple of days have been green, as i'm sure you all know
uh, the last couple of days have been green, as i'm sure you all know
uh, the last couple of days have been green, as i'm sure you all know
uh, firstly, i apologize that i've been a bit out of the swing of things
uh, lately, i just, i went away for a wedding and stuff, and i got a little bit sick
so we mentioned that anytime that price entered into that yellow circle over there, that would be an area where you could potentially be buying up, expecting a mean reversion trade
and that looks like exactly what we've got going on at the moment
the next question i'm sure many of you are wondering as well, with that mean reversion trade, how high could price possibly get before we need to start fading it? well, definitely the grey box territory comes in as an area of interest, as well as the yellow 21 ema on the weekly chart, which is coming in around six thousand dollars
i said, let's have a look and watch what happens over here with the sr flip
this is obviously part of the reason why everything is rallying and the risk on assets
and this is the first time i've looked at this chart since the last show that i had
and the previous area that was as resistance is now flipping into support
the dexi is bouncing up off of that um, but crypto does seem to be rallying with it
the dexil most likely target back towards the range high, especially if it manages to close around this level here, then you can expect the dexi going up to about 10376, which is this white horizontal line over here
uh, see what he was mentioning is that most likely still, uh, same scenario
unless the fed flips into a more davis scenario, we can expect that probably risk on assets are going to suffer
and this is just a temporary relief rally within crypto and other risk on assets
so most likely, quarter three, quarter four, possibly even quarter one of next year, is when we would probably have a proper reversal
so everything is forward looking, meaning that people are already anticipating what the next basis point rate hikes will be
we have the quantitative tightening beginning, which i think they uh reducing the balance sheet by about something like one million dollars every second or every minute
so, but let's go into the charts over here, anything that really matters
so i've updated all of the charts, and i will be posting them on my twitter so feel free to follow me
so i'll put the link as what's in the description there below
and there will also be a card that will pop up for the viewers that aren't watching live
all right? so if i have to zoom out over here a little bit, you see you got your diagonal trend line resistance on bitcoin, which has been governing the lower highs throughout
and we have price that's kind of broken out of this gray box territory over here, which we said was our main consolidation range and the range low and the range high over there, coming at 30 700
once we broke through that, the structure started to change slightly
so i would be waiting to see, are we going to form higher highs and then a higher low, and then try and crack through this area over here, which is the diagonal resistance, or are we going to turn back over and come down? well, currently, the main area of interest if this were to happen today, and price were to continue on strong, this is an eighthour chart, by the way, then i have one the 34 sixty seven dollar zone, as an area of interest
and the reason why is, if you take a fib retracement level from up there all the way down, you have that golden zone, which is the zero point, six one, eight foot retracement level, which comes in into that yellow circle over there
so if we manage to break through that, your next liquidity zone is coming up at 36 000
and remember, that has confluence with over here, the 21 ema on the weekly chart as well
so that's your next liquidity zone, but only really long term
they'll become bullish once you start to clear the key horizontal level at 37 000
i'm not saying that anybody should wait and before they take any sort of a long until we get above this level, because you're obviously going to then miss out on an enormous move, which would be 20 up for bitcoin
we'll play it by er, and i'll update you with every single trade that i make on my twitter account
so at the time being, i'm just remaining patient, waiting to see what happens over here
if price does get up to this level over here, i'm most likely short in anticipation of a rejection from that zone
i have a couple of other coins over here, you'll see similar sort of charts on ethereum as well
that horizontal that you have, or the diagonal trend line on bitcoin, is coming much, much higher, with a 0618 for but 2 867
and i will post all of these charts on my twitter because i do know that they're quite small
but what i'm watching over here at the moment is the main liquidity zone is coming way down between a thousand three hundred and thousand four hundred and fifty dollars on ethereum
i'll be watching to see if price can clear above this yellow circle, which is the main higher area that i want cleared
if that clears, it at 2146, then i'll say, well, maybe the whole market structure is changing
this could be a local bottom, but for a macro, long term bottom, you wouldn't expect to see a wick like this, price come all the way back down, pretty much close at the same level, and roll back over and turn full on bullish
so get back above this level, create the higher high, wait for the next higher low, uh, and then great, we can start to form a new trend, and we'll buy into that
is coming way, way, way up at 80, with a liquidity zone over there as well
so first, you need to get above that fifty dollar level before you even consider targeting the top of the range, which is at fifty nine dollars
if you get above the fifty nine dollars, then, again, similar to what i just mentioned with ethereum, the whole market structure begins to shift and change
but, uh, otherwise, it's looking like it's stuck within a range similar to what bitcoin was in
uh, about a few weeks back, we saw bitcoin was stuck for about two and a half weeks, bouncing between the top and the bottom of the range
so, um, i have a couple more i'm not going to manage to get through all of them today, so i would suggest just follow me on twitter as soon as the show is finished, within the next hour
i'm going to post all of these charts on there so you can see the more detailed approach
and then that gives more detailed overlay of what my thoughts are in the current market
but any sort of bounces at the moment that we have, i am looking to short into, especially because this was a massive, impulsive move, and i would expect that, uh, things are eventually going to roll over at least to short into the next higher low
so if i short and i buy into the higher low before i go along, then i will still make at least a decent sculpt over there

[Music] see what could happen in the next coming hours and the next few days
what kind of opportunities is the market going to give us today, guys, and the next couple of days? because we've actually hit this major level spot on here, as you can see, you know, we can go to the two hourly chart, we can go to the four hourly chart
there was a big, major weekly level closing also the four hourly chart, below this major weekly level
i mean, these trend lines are not randomly here in the chart because of some reason
they are here because they are an important level, and you could get a big reaction from them
we were talking the last few days, two value area highs from this trading range for the last, you know, 15, 20 days
and we did, you know, hit the value high from this range to perfection, as you can see, getting that consolidation on this level of 30 500, then getting the next consolidation here at the 32 000 range
and this was mentioned on the live stream, okay, just two days ago, as you can see here on the charts here on this channel
okay, on the, on the 29th of may, we were talking about this scenario over here
why could this happen? also explained very, very clearly on on on the channel
okay, where we did talk about this swing failure pattern, this big, massive selling pressure that was bought back up straight away, okay, from the demand
when you could see this, you know, one hourly, two hourly candle, you can go to the four hourly also
it was a big, massive wick where the demand was pushing in straight below twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
and only when we created this candle over here, because i was talking about potential bearish scenarios here, of course, coming down to lower levels, coming to the 618
as soon as we printed this candle over here, i was saying it was very likely to potentially retrace
we're going to retest this area, and it's going to fail to break, and then we're going to consolidate and have this potential leg up to hit the 30 500, which was the first major resistance level
but if we're gonna have that big, major pushup to this range, it is very likely gonna get another pushup to our next, big, major supply level, which was at the 32 000 range
and this was exactly explained on the live stream on the 29th of may, just two days ago
guys, looking for those pushups, that exact stop at this level, and the next exact stop at the 32 000
exact moments here on the price of bitcoin, having that leg up
now this is the moment, of course, i am in my long position still
who knows if we're gonna go have that leg up, right? this is the moment i'm starting to become embarrassed at this zone
if you are interested in buybit to trade on buybit, you got an insane bonus of up to 4050
okay? if you use my link in the description, you've got 30 days free of fee maker fee, which is something that i wanted to point out
now, let's go straight back here in to the chart or bitcoin, because and i'll go through the comment section right away
but i just want to explain, guys, it's super important on the live streams
i want to talk five, ten minutes, give a brief explanation of what has happened and what could potentially happen, because this is the moment i am going to be bearish
like i explained on my latest videos and live streams, this is a massive, big area
we've got the last big, major lower high where this might just be a supply um zone, okay, where we just get a bunch of liquidity here
we already seen some people been a little bit too bearish, calling for 35 000, even calling for 38 000, just because of this major pump that we've had the last few days
this is the moment you want to be bullish down at these levels
i am waiting to see how the, the the selling pressure, basically, is going to gain on top of the buying pressure
i am waiting for this major reaction, to see how the next candlesticks on the one hourly, on the two hourly, more or less, are going to react to this big, big level
and this will be the moment i will react and potentially short the market
just to be pretty clear, there's a nice fib level here that i do like that we almost hit, which is the 50 from the start of the big, major drop
your question might be, because a lot of people don't know where to place fib levels
fibonacci retracement will from the start of a big, major drop
the big, major drop starts right over here, on the 4th of may
okay, retracement where you probably going to get respected from these levels
and if i take fibonacci from this high to the lows, you can already see the first major touch here at the 382
was very much respected from the top to this low, 382, here at the 30 900
look how we got a big, massive correction from this range that was already a very much respected level
so, next big level after breaking the zone, and you can see here, look how we struggle to break the 382
you know, you can see this major level is that level that we have been waiting for to break
we were hitting the 382 apart from this major resistance zone, as you can see, getting rejected every single time
looking at the volume profile, yeah, this was a big, major level
now, um, next level is really all the way up here at the 325, 326
you know, it's also the the largest wick from the last lower height
i wouldn't be surprised to see some kind of wicks here to the upside and get heavily rejected from the zone
of course, what could happen? can we drop here from these levels? yes
but there is also potentially a good trading opportunity at these levels, guys
i mean, if this plays out exactly like in december that we have been talking about for the last few days, is going to be absolutely amazing
we've got either one, a big, big level here at the 30 600, you know, give or take a few hundred, because of the volatility, where we have a big, big, big resistance that will potentially be turning into support, at least for one bounce, at least for one bounce, maybe
and that is here the thirty thousand six hundred dollar range, give or take a few hundred dollars, because of the volatility, this major level where we could correct down to this range
it's a possibility, if we do correct down to this level, you know, one bounce, at least one bounce maybe, to create a lower high or a double top, or something like that
you know, there's a potential quick scalp, day trade opportunity at those levels
of course, if we start retrace meaning getting a small consolidation, a little bit of a reaction
and, you know, best example that i could give you here is zooming back, okay, all the way um to december of 2021, when we were trading around about the 50 000 range over here
we had this kind of price action, retesting the last lower high range, which is this one that i'm showing you, at the 32 000
and, you know, we've got a big, major resistance level that we hit multiple times, and then get one bounce there for creation of that double top scenario, hitting the last lower high and then continuing to the downside, where a lot of people are already, you know, calling for 35 000, 38 000
let's calm down, and let's remind ourselves that we are in a very aggressive downtrend and that we are hitting super strong resistance levels here
as you can see here on the chart, this 32, 325 k levels is gonna be very hard work for bitcoin to start breaking and continuing, you know, this short term bullish momentum, especially when the s p 500 is looking slightly bearish at this zone
you know that that 4 200, 4 250 range was a major range here where i would start becoming bearish on the s p 500
so we can analyze s p 500, but i don't want to do this because i want to go through the comment section right away
if we have some a few minutes afterwards, we can do s p if somebody does ask for it in the comment section, i will take a look and take a look at you with you guys, to find out those big, major resistance levels, find out those big, major support levels where we could have those opportunities
just a quick reminder, i did close my long positions on the s p 500 here on primex bt
okay? those long positions has been, i have been closed from the 39 000, from the 3 900 range
if you want to trade s p 500 and you want to use bitcoin ethereum as collateral or stable coins, you can also trade gold, you know, dax 30, silver, crude
you have an insane bonus down below on primex bt, which is up to seven, no, sorry, not up to you
you deposit a thousand dollars, you're getting seventy dollars, you're getting, you're depositing ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred dollars on top of that
i mean, also, we can see knc, there's been some major opportunities on kyber network
i mean, it's been pretty, pretty crazy how we did touch to perfection the 618 level here from this pump, and now we are, you know, we are getting rejected from a major level, right? there's, you know, level to level, there's been so many, many opportunities here to take advantage on knc
what i want to do is say hello to the community and take a look, um, you know, at some different cryptos and, you know, just analyze the situation, see where we could find some good opportunities
and i need you first of all to absolutely crush, absolutely smash up the like button right away
okay? so we can get more people in, and we can, you know, this is a good way to support the channel, so it so it does continue to grow
how are you doing? hi, andy moore 3mr, how are you doing? matt, how are you the phaser? good morning, andy and all the other of course
lawrence, how are you? um, the og and technical, uh, analysis in fast
and when i'm not right, i always say, you know, and, you know, try and have good risk management to say, you know, this got stopped out
but what i wanna, you know, it's been absolutely insane how i have been explaining the risk to reward from this potential move
okay, we're gonna take a look at the twohour either one hourly, it doesn't really matter
but waiting for that retracement from this, you know, swing failure to the six, one, eight, entering a trade here, having the stop loss here behind this, um, this wick
the risk to reward here, you can clearly see, you know, you are risking one to gain three or four
okay, i've actually got small i did close 20 more of my position
i've only got 20 open from this range, you know, just in case we, i want to see that that reaction
as soon as i start seeing this, this kind of price action, of course, or this kind of price action where we do actually correct, come back up and get rejected again, then, yeah, i'll say, okay, this is it, you know, this is it
so i'll be closing most of my, uh, the rest of my position, basically
the risk to reward from this trade, it's, it was absolutely insane
you go, you know, you've got a four to one, three to one, four to one trade right there that we have been talking about for the last few days
it absolutely played beautifully here, spot on to to the exact, you know, uh, second target that we were talking about
so, um, yeah, i, i haven't been trading bitcoin the last week
you know, i was saying, you know, guys, i'm not doing any trading
there was only two trades that i took here, which was this balance over here at the 28 600 range here
just the first bounce there, you know, because we were range trading, and i said, right, let's let's try and range trade with a tight stop loss
okay? this was mentioned on the 24th, 25th of of may, very likely on a live stream
you know, i didn't do any trading here on bitcoin at this, like, this range, you know, for for quite a few days
well, i was just saying, you know, guys, i'm not in any trade
i just don't see any, any opportunity, you know, we could roll down from this range
i didn't, uh, you know, it's still a little bit in doubt of of, you know, where i could see the high probability zone
there was only one trade that i took here, uh, for this long and this one i did actually take profits here at the six, one, eight, fifty percent
then when i saw this, this is the moment that, you know, i had a more aggressive trade at this level
you know, it might be five, it might be ten, uh, but, you know, you just need a few trades, of course, to actually have a very nice month
and also, you know, where are the best levels to enter on positions? i hope you do learn a lot in this channel
of course, i am aiming to get a course out at the end of the year, and it's gonna be the most simple course, because i have done a bunch of courses of training for the last five years, and, um, yeah, most of them just talk too much
i want to make a cr trading, cryptocurrency course where i go straight to the point straight to the point, no talks, no, you know, just straight to the point, so you can understand with some examples
anyway, so it's something that i want to get out there so you guys can learn, you know, how to do technical analysis and trading, of course, most importantly, um, you know, after doing this major course
so, anyway, this is going to be one of the, these are the best moments to invest in cryptocurrency
i know most of your people, um, after i was asking, okay, uh, sorry
i was asking the last couple of weeks on a few live streams, you know, how many of you got into crypto in 2021 and 2022? and it was over 60 of the people, over 60 of the people got into crypto in 2021 2022
and i'm going to say that 2022 and 2023 are going to be the best years that you are going to get into crypto
you know, i am really in the red right at this moment on a bunch of cryptos that are down, 80, 90, 95 percent
but, you know, from alltime high, it is down, what is it down from alltime high? approximately, yeah, around about 60 percent, uh, from these letters from the high, alltime highs
i mean, these are the best moments to get in right now, into crypto
it's going to be a lot of sideways and downside action with some relief rallies, of course, just like we're having right now
but it's gonna be the best moment to dollar cost average, you know, not financial advice, of course
this is what i've been doing the entire, you know, 2018, 2019 and 2020
guys, the ones, the people here in the comment section right now, the people that are sticking into crypto for the next coming years, will be the total winners
yeah, and follow, you know, the the markets absolutely smash that
morning all said, laurie, andy, can you, can we have a look at arvey, please? let's take a look at rv cryptocurrency
why not? what is going on with arvaya? this is one of those, you know, massive d5 projects that had an explosion in the summer of 2020
where are they? am synthetics, chain link, a bunch of crypto currencies in the d5 space had a big, massive explosion and went multiple percentage to the upside
now, let's get a chart here with rv that we do have a little bit of more
but, yeah, you can see it would have been nice to have a little bit more of a leg up
i probably wouldn't have shorted this because we were, yeah, a few percentage off from reaching the actual d point
let me just zoom out here on the threeday chart a little bit more to check out the big, major support levels
because all of these major support ranges have been broken right now
where that big level has been round about this range, in between the 50 and 75 is where we do have a big volume
okay, here on the vpvr, this is extremely important, because we have been trading in between, you know, forty dollars and and eighty dollars
but all the way, you know, from august of 2020 till december of, um, december, january of 2021
so over five months in a range, you know, trading at these levels
and this is usually going to be a strong level where the price will potentially consolidate
we'll be getting those bounces, all right? but what we can see in the short term here on rv, after this relief rally, we are just hitting our resistance number one
so let me just go zoom in here on rv, just to keep it pretty simple, um, let's go to the daily chart, start zooming in a little bit and check out our big, major levels on rv here
yeah, we are hitting a resistance number one, which can be broken, because we have retested once
and then if we do break this major resistance level, i do see us coming all the way to the 170 that would be the most interesting level here on rv, where we would be hitting, you know, fifty percent, even the six, one, eight, in between 150 and 180, approximately
and those would be the most interesting levels to be hit in the next coming days, maybe a week or so, or two even, all depending on how we're going to manage to get up this range
but that would be a major level where i do think the price would be getting heavily rejected
of course, we're hitting a resistance number one here, which is currently at the 120 range
from these lows, we could actually turn around from this level, or have a kind of a double bottom scenario come back up
i would want to see a bigger retracement, hitting some big consolidation ranges, fibonacci levels, from this high to the low, looking for that 50 618, which would be in between 160, 180 here
you know, this is only if bitcoin does have insanely bullish momentum
but the the probabilities in getting rejected here, of course, would be going to, you know, step number one, which would be going back to bitcoin
what is bitcoin doing? is bitcoin looking bullish or bearish at this range? and i, you know, i think it's looking bearish
this is a bearish zone for bitcoin, where i'm going to wait patiently for the next one, two days to see how we're going to react
you know, if we come down here, you know, this is a potential scalp opportunity
you know, we can see that bitcoin usually likes to retest the highs or the lows, all right, where they it usually wants to come back down to have a retest, right? when you create a high, you want to retest it
so the probabilities here on bitcoin and actually getting one more, one bounce after this retracement, you know, potentially down to 31 to 30 500, you know, getting one bounce, and and retesting this zone, or almost retesting the zone, potentially creating a slightly lower high double top, or even a double top here, breaking the highest swing failure, basically coming back up to the zone
you know, if we retrace, the probabilities in coming back to this zone at least once, you know, is 70 percent
all right? after a retracement, you want to have a retest to see the demand pressure, uh, or or the selling pressure, how it's going to react again at this range
so this means that i would be slightly bearish on ave, right? because bitcoin is the leader
you know, bitcoin looks ready for a potential retracement here at the 32 000 range
if we start getting consolidation between one day or two, and we get a consolidation here on rv here at this level, at the 120, then i will be bearish
i will see that it's very likely that this altcoin will have the retracement from this range, potentially to come as low as the 70 80
so if i'm, if i'm doubting in some levels on an altcoin, which i hardly trade, i hardly trade, um, all coins, just a few of them sometimes
what is bitcoin telling me? if bitcoin is telling me bullish, then i would be bullish on old coin
if bitcoin is telling me bearish, consolidation, then i would be, you know, i would be, i would be waiting for a consolidation at this level
and if bitcoin looks like it's going to drop, of course, most of the altcoins will follow
so, yeah, i mean, i guess, i mean, who knows? we've got this scenario over here
all right? relief rally in the short term, of course, it was very, very possible
we've been talking about this also because of the volume, uh, on the weekly chart on coinbase
again, shout out to, um, kevin's benson, talking about, you know, this scenario here, where big spikes in volume on the weekly does mean that you potentially, very likely going to create a local bottom, all right? or a local top
as you can see here on the chart, having a little bit of volatility, maybe to the downside
we did have that weekly spike in volume, okay, in the beginning of may
and this was giving me confidence for that relief rally without retesting the 25, uh, 26 000 low
this is why we were talking bullish every single time, you know, in this consolidation
we were talking about the likelihood scenario to have a leg up here before actually retesting the lows
so if you ask, you're asking me, 38 000, if you are safe, if you're shorting from that level? well, for the moment, yes, it's a definitely level you you need to be protected
my question is, you know, people that are shorting from much higher levels, where is your target? you know, where is tracy? let me know in the comment section, where is your target? where are you looking to take profits on this short position? and if you say, i don't know, i would say, you know, start taking profits
where are you going to take profits? nobody knows for to exact perfection, where the low is going to be
i know, a lot of people are talking about twenty three thousand dollars, twenty thousand eighteen even, you know, ten thousand dollar areas
nobody knows for certain that we are gonna reach those levels, of course
you you should be in pretty good profits, and protect your position at all costs, just in case the bitcoin price does come back up to those levels
um, anyway, what i want to do is show here, on the weekly chart, or the three um threeday charts, one second here, very importantly, this kind of descending wedge pattern
this is a channel that we were talking about for a long, long time here in march and also april
um, one thing that i'm potentially worried about, uh, is, is is to come back up, okay, to this level
we're not worried about, of course, you know, we will be looking for good opportunities, but after a break out of a major channel
you know, this is a longterm, ascending channel from january all the way till the end of april, where we started to break out from this channel
this is something that we talked about, potential measured movie here from the breakout was the width of the channel, retesting, you know, these lows, testing the the actual target to perfection
what, you know, a lot of assets like to do is come back up, go back to the scene of the crime, right? is that is, is there is the saying, the scene of the crime is the breakout of this major support level
so, you know, a lot of the time the assets, you know, when you break a support zone, when you're trading in a range, or or a pattern, or whatever, you just say, you know, you have a, you have a symmetrical triangle, or you have a channel
when you break out, the channel coming back to the scene of the crime would be the resistance, in this case, or the support coming back to the scene of the crime
okay? a symmetrical triangle, you break support, come back to retest the resistance, even though it's slightly higher
this is, this happens, you know, i would say, 70 to 80 percent of the times
so, scene of the crime here, from this channel would be all the way up here
so, could this happen in in one, two weeks, you know, this would be coming as high as 38 or 40 000, okay? where you could potentially see that break out from these lower highs, massive, big fake out, all right? and then come back in and continue the downside
this is most of the people were not expecting this, okay? and you know the deal, you could, you know, expect the unexpected
can bitcoin rally to 38, 40 000 in the next couple of weeks? it definitely can
and i think it's going to be a very good shorting opportunity
we're going to start seeing people, you know, becoming extremely bullish, of course, if we were to hit those levels
we've got the lower, a higher low, sorry, from this ascending channel that we were talking about here for a long, long time
and it's also the resistance from these lower highs, where you could get that volatility area and then have that big correction back down
if we do go to those levels, we'll be taking a look at the big resistance levels to find trolling opportunities when we go up, of course
um, you know, i am looking for for short positions if we are on an aggressive downtrend like this
um, in the immediate, short term, yes, we could look for longs
of course, we could be looking for longs here on this uptrend
so we want to take a look at the biggest resistance levels for potential shorting opportunities
let's take a look at, um, the comment section and maybe take a look at some altcoins
why not? mark dutch, thank you for the insane support, my man
i think kda is a good l1 project that is just gonna, i mean, it's just gonna consolidate for a long, long time
okay, where you have a massive, a fourier phase and a massive, you know, anxiety depression, where you're just going to consolidate for a long, long time
there's a lot of the l1 projects, remember, first of all, ethereum is king
look at what happened to tara luna, you know, one of the strongest l1 projects, you know, in the top ten just last month, did you and ethereum has the latest, you know, has the longest track record
it's, you know, most of the projects are built on ethereum, you like it or not
l2s are going to successfully um grow on ethereum, such as matic, you know, loop ring, metis
and i think l2s are going to be a, a very strong thing in the next coming year
l1 projects, i think they are losing a little bit of of interest because of this massive terra luna fiasco
i mean, who's, you know, do you want to invest in cardano? they've been lagging for smart contracts and all of these promises
if you take a look at most of, you know, charles huskinson's tweets, and, you know, all the promises that he's been telling for the last couple of years
you will see that more than half of what he's been saying is, yeah, hasn't happened
cadena is yet supposedly a really fast, you know, blockchain project
ethereum has been, you know, here for over, then, over eight years
uh, it's, you know, most of the projects have been built on it is purely decentralized
ethereum will go above ten thousand dollars in the next coming years
so all you going to go on the safe bet, or you're going to go on the more risky side
anyway, cadena, i do think, is one, that, one of those l ones that will survive and will do well, in my personal opinion
but you gotta always remember, you know, um, ethereum is is is king
so, anyway, what i wanted to say here that cadena can enter a really nice accumulation zone at these levels
what levels are these? these levels are, you know, in between, basically the lows of 140 and 250, approximately
some between that 140 and 250 is where i think cadena will be trading for the next few months
and why do i think this was after such an aggressive drop? you know, you can just, you know, the best example would be he on a cadena, look at january to april
january to april, you've got four months of kind of consolidation with the relief rallies creating lower highs, uh, you know, at this big spike of the vpvr
we've had a few weeks in october, this is the threeday chart, where we have consolidated at this area
so this area was also, you know, getting, you know, that major support range
so this is the, the other reason why i think that cadena will be range trading for several months
and you can find a lot of opportunities inside of these ranges
okay, we'll do some quick analysis on kadena here, zooming in on the chart
the reason why, i think, after such an aggressive drop, usually after an aggressive drop, you do consolidate for some months, potentially
and you have the spiky on the vpvr because of a large consolidation that you did have here in september and october of 2021
this is the, this is why, one of the reasons why the price is stopping at this level, and why it's going to be very likely, boring price action in between here, like i said, the 140 approximately and the 250
and this is a, you know, it's gonna have a lot of range trading for a long, long time, in my personal opinion, uh, till we actually, you know, start seeing some bullish momentum
will it be at the end of 2022, beginning of 2023? of course, this is all it could take much longer than that
looking at the price action from may, looking at the last, kind of 30 days of volume traded, that's a big drop, massive, big resistance rejection here
it's going to be very, very hard, especially if bitcoin's going to be looking bearish in the next coming days
i do see cadena potentially creating another lower high and continuing this downtrend, potentially to retest the lows
and, you know, it's just going to be a lot of sideways action here on cadena, with pumps and dumps
a lot of sideways action to be expected on cadena, in my personal opinion
i do think that, um, cadena is one of those l ones that that will do well
um, yeah, uh, i've got, i i got yannick here saying, guys, short or long on bitcoin? you you need to decide on at the end of the day
i've got, you know, i've burnt so many accounts back in the day, in 2017 and 2018, that, yeah, emotions do get destroyed
uh, like i said, i will be, i will be waiting patiently for the next coming days
this is why i still have a free risk position still at this level
you know, next major leg up on bitcoin might be breaking this level
it might, it just might be breaking and i'll tell you what, i will have a bunch of people that haven't been, you know, taking, you know, close attention on my latest videos and live streams that we are going to say on the comment section, you said that we were going to get rejected here
this is if we do break this level, you know, in between today and tomorrow
i think that we could actually claim this last wick over here
this is exactly where the 50 fibonacci retracement is from this high to the low
i still think we could actually retest the highs from here, the 30 this this high over here, 32 200
after this major rally, why would i long here at the top of a range? i went along here when i can see confluence? i am looking for shorts
we have big, major resistance levels, fifty percent fibonacci, thirty two six thirty two thousand six hundred
we got thirty one thousand seven hundred and seventy dollar range, which is a major weekly level
we can see the volatility here created on the 9th, the 10th, the 11th of may, bang, bang
i'm adding stuff here to this level, saying, right, this is going to be very hard to break
please wait to see what is the price action going to do in between today tomorrow
are we gonna break above it, you know? are we gonna consolidate? are we gonna have some failed breakouts? this is the moment i will do an emergency live stream
anyway, guys, i really want you guys to to to learn and be patient, because, yeah, this is the the reason why i got this
um, i went a little bit crazy there was because of, um, uh, yeah, i got this
um, this yannick saying, guys, shall we short or long? uh, you you need to, um, decide at the end of the day
it will be a real one for a potential trade opportunity, right? not like this
i'm really sorry with titles sometimes, um, yeah, sometimes i want a minute, hang on a minute
let's take a look at, you know, i'm really sorry with these alarms in these things, but this needs to attract people
this is obviously, you know, a little bit of click bait, but i really want to provide really good content
i used to do those crazy thumbnails where it would like, i used to do those thumbnails
um, yeah, i can't find any, but, yeah, they are, some, they are
if i do find some, i will, i will, i will pass them through the telegram group
if you don't, if you haven't joined the telegram group down below, you can join
you can talk about, you know, we try and talk mostly about trading and crypto, but you you are free to talk of whatever you want
of course, if you are gonna start, you know, bullying someone, or, or, you know, talking insults, you know, you, you will be kicked out
let's let, you know, uh, if ethereum is prince as foreign bitcoin king
let's go here and take a look at solana and analyze the situation
we were talking about solana very likely finding very strong support, you know, at this 40 range, because it was a very, very large resistance consolidation level that we did have back in may, january here, of 2021, as you can see, getting massive, massive resistance
i mean, this formed a kind of descending triangle, descending wedge that finally broke to the upside massively
this is a large consolidation, multimonthly consolidation, where we did create a huge spike on the vpvr
and i do think a larger relief rally is, is very, very possible here on on solana
uh, i think solana is actually lagging a little bit compared to the other cryptos
you can see some other cryptos there are actually, you know, gaining the last low high from the drop, right? already
there the the, you know, solana should be trading, if you're going to compare it to some other all coins, around about the 60 dollars already
the only, the only bad thing about solana is just, obviously, it is hitting a big resistance zone here where, you know, this, this 48 is a major resistance zone
what would i have to see on solana to become bullish in the short term would be breaking this trend line over here
i mean, this is the thing, we got a big spike on the vpvr from this level
so, but if we start seeing a solid break out here with volume, [Music], yeah, i would be waiting patiently for a retracement, and then i would be potentially looking for lungs
and the price action could come down, especially if bitcoin is going to be bearish
remember, still, you know, step number one is looking at bitcoin
if step number one is bearish, uh, very likely altcoins going to be bearish too
bitcoin leads the market 80, 85 of the times of, you know, 100 of the old coins, uh, 95 or the old coins
we are hitting this major support that is turning into resistance
we got lower highs here, from the 16th of may, from the 17th of may, from the 23rd of may
right over here, a resistance trend line that is from a downtrend
so if anything, this is a, this is a a level where the price could continue down, this 80, 48 range, you know, 48, 49, 50
if we do see, you know, that volatility to the upside and some failed attempts, you need to see some failed attempts, price action right down here, again, this is very likely to continue to the downside
so your, i mean, this is the, this is the, uh, the key also, this is the key
wait for the price action to see how can it manage to break out from a support or from a resistance
wait till you see, uh, you know, potential big breakouts that are being failed
so that 48, 48, uh, dollar range, this range over here, where we're currently trading at, you know, let's see how if we are going to cope to break the zone, if we have some, uh, um, multiple attempts of br trying to break this resistance and fail, this is a moment you want to be coming bearish, seeing, you know, it's very likely we might be retesting the 40 lows
but if we do have a pretty large, solid breakout, you know, big four hourly candle breakout, bang, you know, then, of course, he on solana, if on of in in on any retracement, you know, you might get resistance at this high, at these highest levels
if you have a four hourly candle, you know, this is already a resistance level
you take a look at the the fibonacci retracement, the fibonacci levels from this high of the 15th of may on solana to the lows, you got the 618, which is at the biggest point of control
this could be the the area where you might wick above, come back down, hit the level again, come back down
i wouldn't be, um, a bullish if we start hitting 51, it is not enough
you would have to go as high as the 7 8 with a solid, big candle, retesting these highs over here, the big four hourly candle
then on the retracement, would be looking pretty pretty bullish for another leg up
a lot of people might think, okay, we are breaking the resistance trend line, you know, right over here, oh, solana is breaking resistance trend line here, from the lower highs
you know, it's time to long, because it's very likely going to have a big leg up to the upside
and then what you have here on this breakout is, is, is, is this, uh
and you're actually coming below these lows and having that consolidation
don't worry, if you break above, you will have time to get into consolidations
at resistance levels, there are opportunities every single day, every single couple of days, you know, depending on how you do your your analysis
i would that's what i would be doing for solana, wait for that potential, you know, reaction at this level
how are we going to react at this potential breakout? is it going to be a massive, big fake out, and we're just going to have some few weeks here and lower highs, and this is very, very likely going to continue back down to potentially reach us the 40 range, um that's how i'd be, i would be approaching this, especially if we are going to see bitcoin having multiple attempts in trying to break the 32 325 000, that is the moment where, you know, i would be looking, you know, if bitcoin does, if bitcoin does have this kind of price action at the 32 000 range, plus minus, you know, there's 500 because of the volatility, looking for those wicks, that is the moment i would be saying, right, i am bearish on bitcoin
if i do see these kind of reactions, um, i would go into all coins such as solana, and saying, if solana, after that reaction on bitcoin, you know, hitting 32 325, you know, you might see solana having a whip, a little bit of a spiky action, a little bit of this kind of movement
but also solana, after having this kind of reaction from this strong level, fake outs, resistance from lower highs, fake outs, that will be the moment you want to short when a lot of people are saying, we are breaking resistance line
looks pretty bullish or this is very likely the moment that you might get rejected
anyway, that's, um, just a brief explanation here on what i would think, um, uh, waves, please
where to short? says ibrahimich, absolutely, why not? btc dominance is preparing the next leg up
let's take a look also at bitcoin dominance, and let's take a look at waves
where to short? well, we can take a look at major, major legs
let me just go to the daily threeday chart here on the bitcoin dominance
i think we can have a another leg up here on the bitcoin dominance, absolutely
end target for the bitcoin dominance would be around about the 54, 55
we might get one more leg up, and then a sideways corrective move
it might be good for some altcoins, a little bit of a relief rally, if bitcoin behaves
of course, if bitcoin goes down and the bitcoin dominance goes down, it doesn't matter, the all coins will go down
also, um, but, um, yeah, i think, you know, the end end and um, level here for the next coming months is 54, 55, 56, bitcoin dominance, which will be the opportunity of a lifetime to get back into altcoins for the next run
okay, by, you know, 2020 and 2023, 2024, you know, it might be very, very boring, large consolidation here, pumps and dumps
and then, you know, by 2024, 2025, it is very likely to to create that lower high on the bitcoin dominance, just by like the the other cycle in 2017
you know, bear market, lower high, bull cycle, end of 2020, 2021
and on that bear market, of course, there's going to be so many good, good projects that will survive
ethereum already got, 20 25, between 20 and 25 percent of the entire mark, you know, the ethereum dominance, basically it's got 20 25 of the entire crypto market capitalization
it didn't even have four or five, four, five, four percent of the entire market capitalization
so there will be a lot of crypto projects, good ones that will be getting a lot, a lot of the bitcoin dominance
of course, bitcoin is not going to have 100, and never going to have a 90 of the entire crypto market capitalization
it's just going to make lower highers, low highs for the next, you know, a couple of decades, going to and it will be stable, maybe in 10, 20 uh, when the crypto market capitalization will be in the trillions of dollars
so anyway, just, uh, just a little bit of my, my point of view there
i could be totally wrong, but that's what i think could happen
and creating that lower high in between 2022 and 2023, uh, at that 54, 55
and it will be a very good opportunity to get into all coins when the bitcoin dominance is high
theta is one of those insane crypto projects that i do think is also going to survive
it used to be an erc20 back in the day, uh, but it has its own main net
i think it's an insane project, really, really important for the future
um, i have this here for some reason, this fibonacci retracement
let me just zoom out on one second, and then we'll zoom in and see what's happening on on um, on theta
theta's got an insane level where i do think it's going to be the ultimate lows, which is this level
i've got an alert just heard to see if if theta is going to hit 80 cents, i will be buying a bunch of theta at those levels
i already had a bunch of cryptos, but i remember seeing theta when it was at 15 cents, and it had a, it did a 100x basically at alltime high, hitting over 15
and just, you know, learning about the project, doing some, um, a lot of, a lot of analysis on it, and it's a very, very good project
you know, this might be an opportunity for me to accumulate theta in between, you know, the 80 cent level and two dollar range
it might have a large, large, boring consolidation for the next several months
and this is, um, a very good level where, where you where it, well, it, it will enter an accumulation zone, uh
and theta is one of those projects that i do think will do very, very good
so, most important level here on theta where we did have a large consolidation
you got one big consolidation here back in december, january of 2021
as you can see here, over a month, a month and a half of consolidation
as you can see, the price action does get a reaction at these levels, getting those bounces
i'm talking about the 230 range here, approximately, which was the highs from this large consolidation
so what is going to very likely happen now, if the market were to continue bearish? what is our next page? and big, major consolidation level, it is right over here, 80 cents would be the big resistance from a large consolidation that we had in september, october, november, in part of december of 2020
you know, this was over three months of consolidation, looking at the threeday chart
and this is where you do have one of the biggest spikes in volume profile
so that would be my ultimate low potential, big bounce area i would put, i would enter a swing long position here for for several weeks, because i do see a bigger, large relief rally before coming back down in sideways, boring action for the several months
but you are looking for what is the strongest level for a big bounce
if we were to continue back down, you know, because we don't know if we're going to pump from this range or dump
but if we dump, where could we get a big bounce? is what you want to know
and i can tell you right now that, you know, with 80 certainty, in my personal opinion, with my experience, you can see it right over here, big consolidation on theta
of course, there is a moment that you are aggressively creating lower highs that you, you knock on the door, you will, you know, you will break that door
we only hit 97 cents on the lows created on the 10th of may, uh, or 12th of may
so, yeah, what if? what if right now we're just inside of this, uh, you know, we're just gonna have these relief rallies
if bitcoin is bearish, i do see most of the old coins being bearish
if bitcoin is slightly bullish, we could see higher levels, um
from this drop, what drop? the drop that we had from the 10th of may all the way till the 12th of may, we've got 618
and a big, major support level here, where the price of theta could be getting that reaction
okay? if we do have that leg up, we'll be gaining this liquidity high, okay, this last lower high may, uh, potentially hit in six one eight
if we start hitting, uh, this level and getting a reaction, small double tops on the one hourly, two hourly chart, uh, time frame, that will be a good shorting opportunity
it's going to be an a, b, c kind of movement, and then back down we go
and they, i, i expect that we are going to enter another big, major, a bigger opportunity
i'm, i'm always dollar cost averaging here for the last several weeks on bitcoin and ethereum
i think we might be, see, we'll probably see a better opportunity for altcoins
if theta goes down to 80 cent range, you know, from 80 85 cents, we just hit 97 cents on the 12th of may, so it's not that far off
you know, we could be trading at these levels in a couple of weeks
if it does come all the way down to these levels in the next coming weeks, expect a huge bounce on theta
i would potentially be swing longing if theta comes down to 80 cents
matter of fact, i've got an alarm right here, alert at 83 cents
the reason why is because of the big consolidation that we had, uh, that you know, q4 of 2020, you check out theta, q5 of 2020, large consolidation resistance at 80 cent level, like i just showed you, a big, major bounce to make some money there is, it's almost inevitable
um by bit is one of the best swing trading platforms for crypto in my opinion
if you want to have a trade open for one week, two weeks, two months, five months, the fees are absolutely, you know, really, really cheap
it's um, really profitable to have swing trades open on by bit, just because of the fees
and of course, you get the best deal available that there is out there, which is up to four thousand and fifty dollars, if you sign up with my link
once you sign up with my link, you can follow the steps to claim this bonus on the rewards hub section here, on your profile, on your bible account, of course, if you haven't signed up, if you signed up already on buybit, well, yeah, it is
if we were to see that massive, big bearish action, of course, what would be my biggest resistance zone that i think we could claim this resistance level at the 150
but i do see another leg up to the 160, which is more importantly, because a few weeks up above the last lower high is very, very probable
few weeks up hitting this next major resistance, which is this big support level
and it's also the 618 from this drop that we had from the 9th of may, from the 10th of may, all the way to the 12th of may
in that 618, you know, that would be the ideal range, that would be the ideal range here on theta to see a reaction and a potential short opportunity
and nepalese, thank you very much for that super chat, my man
um, ada, are we looking for 80 cents on ada? um, let me just take a look here
i think they've had some kind of updates on on something, something good
i can't remember what it is right now, but, um, i did read it
um, we do have a big resistance level here on the chart, on 88, at 80 cents
the 80 cent level on ada is super, super strong level, as you can see here on the chart, where we have had large consolidation
that is a level where we are maybe gonna get several attempts in breaking and then get heavily rejected
wow, the fifty percent fibonacci from the the the beginning of april here, first week of april, all the way down here to the 12th of may
well, this is, i mean, this is a month and a half almost drop
we have multiple attempts in breaking this resistance at 80 cent level
is it time to be extremely bullish at this moment? potentially not yet
usually we would have monthly consolidations, so we might pump come back down, pump them back down, and a lot of sideways action
usually, when we are at these low levels, we're not going to have a an insane, massive recovery like this
and and the end of of 2022, we're going to see ada trading at, you know, three dollar alltime high
lower your lower highs, maybe create a slightly lower low, come back up, come back down
a lot of sideways action, because markets have been absolutely crushed
of course, we can take advantage of these major pumps, right? we've been talking about potential double bottoms the last few days, you know, bitcoin, you know, being being bullish from this level, of course
and, yeah, so we can trade to the upside, but let's stay cautious
this is gonna, i'm gonna wrap it up in, uh, here, over an hour, guys, i will be doing another video update
okay? this is one of those levels that i will be eyeing for the next hour, for the next few hours, you know, between today and tomorrow
i think we can come as high as 32 600 to retest this high here, this major wick and also 50 fibonacci retracement
okay, from this big, major drop that we had all the way from the 5th of may all the way to the 12th of may, right? there's a major, major level that i'm looking at
i think we could claim that level a little bit, have a little bit about volatility if we start making this kind of price action
guys, it is emergency livestream time where we are potentially going to short this live for the moment
we could do this, and i would be like, okay, um, yeah, let's try
you know, i knew it was going to be a resistance level, but i'm not going to short it
you know, this was what, this was mentioned on, you know, the last few days
you know, it's absolutely beautiful when you take a look at these major levels, guys
i do smash up that like button, because this was talked on the 29th of may
you know, the leg up, the potential movements, all right, by the end of may, 30th of may
and then you know, that small consolidation and that leg up to get that reaction on that 32 000 level, guys
this is why i was in this long position, looking for that exact movement
all right, last two days ago, look at this live stream from the 29th of may here, just two days ago, predicting the exact moment
get me somebody from youtube that did actually predict this exact moment
and you guys know this, the people that have been following me for a long time, yeah, i'm i'm, i'm wrong sometimes also
but the the reason is that we need to have good risk management
if we risk in one here position to gain five, okay? if we're risking ten dollars to gain thirty dollars or forty dollars, then, yeah, it's game on
it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong, because you just get stopped out
and i hope you do learn a lot in this channel with all of this that i am saying
for all of those experienced traders, you know the deal on buybit and on primexpt, you get the best deals available
okay? they're the my favorite trading platforms that i do use almost every single day, at least every single week
check out bitcoin center's website, where we do have the latest news, technical analysis guides here, totally free information down below
in today's episode, i will show you exactly what we went through this morning live stream
i thought, first of all, the market were supposed to pull back up a little bit
but then when i changed my fibonacci to the 12 hourly, i took it from 36 020 back down to the low of this week
and we are right now inside fibonacci levels on the 12 hourly chart
and if we just zoom in to the lower time frames, you can see the break of structure
and this is where we can see another breakup retest market comes back down
we can also break this one hourly trend line that i also have
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly where the interest is right now on bitcoin and ethereum
[Music], another recap of what we did go through this morning on bitcoin
we'll drag the fibonacci from 36 015, and we drag it back down to the week that we do have at 25 266
first i was i i thought the market was supposed to go up, but then we started to see the market having a little bit of a pullback
and if we also go back in time, you can see that we are right now retesting a previous resistance also
so you can see the market came back up, you had a wick a doji, and now you see the momentum
so what we're gonna do is that we go down to the four outlet charts, and let's see what we can do here
you could see we came back up and retested it to 618 percent at 31 910
you can see that the lower highs, this was the fake out that we just saw a couple of minutes ago
market tried to break this previous resistance that we did have around 31 776
so we could definitely, first of all, come back down to thirty thousand six hundred and thirty seven
if we drag a trend line, because the trend line is, as always, the most important thing
the trend line, the last higher low is technically exactly where the fifty is, at 30 600
but depending on now, if you see the market break, we could potentially see another retest in a couple of hours, and that could be the continuation down
because overall, as you guys know, i do believe that we will see the market pull back down to at least uh 25 250, because that is where the where the week is
i do believe that we need to fail this week until we have a reverse back up
if we also see this, this will also give us another opportunity
now, if the market breaks below potentially 30 290, you can also see a retest of the 50 again, and then see the continuation down
now go down to the lower time frames, you can see that we are retesting the the level at the moment
and we can use this previous support connected with the higher lows, we could definitely see the market pull back up and retest this support trendline that we just broke around, thirty one thousand five hundred and forty eight for then see the continuation to the downside
as you can see, market came exactly up and retested the resistance trend line
i also told i i was also talking about if you break this previous support that would you have around 1945
and you see a potential retest of it, that is definitely another sign that we are breaking to the downside even more we are right now retesting the 50 from above
so another thing that we also can do, as you guys already know, we drag a trend line
we're waiting for the market to create the lower low, and we could potentially break 1913 and then see market pull back up and retest the support, the support around 1945, and then see the drop one more time
we can definitely pull back down to the support one more time
but if we see, if we see a bigger momentum, we can definitely come back down to potentially 1 620, etc
but first of all, i would look at the support around 1720 when it comes to, when it comes to ethereum
and you can see that if we are closing, okay, now this is the daily
but if this two daily candlestick is, if if this four hourly candlestick is closing below 1945, that is definitely a sign that we are, we are on our way to the downside, based also on this fibonacci level that is combined with the resistance trend line
so this definitely, for me, a bearish scenario that we're looking at right now
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and the best thing with buybit is when we have our positions for a longer time, it is the low fees that we want to reach
and somewhere here in the corner, if we look at xrp, the first thing that i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna connect the trend line with the lower highs
we tried to break the level we are right now coming back down to
we either retest the resistance trend line for the continuation, or this could definitely have be a fake out
so if we see the market closing below, potentially 04 000, we can see the market giving us a retest from the resistance trend line from below
and that could be the beginning, uh, for the for xrp also to fill this week that we do have at zero point three thousand three hundred and fifteen
but just to show you exactly what also can happen, is that would drag a fib from zero point three thousand eight hundred and six up to zero point four thousand two hundred and thirteen, if we say the market only come back down and retest zero point four thousand and seven, or zero point three thousand nine hundred and sixtytwo
and you see that the market is giving you the bullish rejections right here
you see the heart market giving you a higher low, for example
and that could be because i also want to show you a bullish perspective
but the thing is, when it comes to when we look at this resist uh fibonacci, as you can see, the the candlestick on the four hourly is very, very volatile
and when we're looking at volatility on the candlestick, and especially when we try to break a resistance trend line, because the market usually does not have the power to do that, you usually see the market actually coming back down
and looking at the daily breakup candle, also go back in time where the last lower high can be, you see that the market never had had the power to break this
so we can see more how it looks on the daily, on the one hourly
and by using the same box, can you see how this was the fake out
and we just changed the box a little bit from the right resistance
that is the exact same thing that we're looking at when it comes to the trend line
fake out, market comes back down, retest the support, the resistance, trend line drop
so the exact same thing i'm looking for on the trend line did happen right here on the box
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
next time, i will have a back testing session together with you in a couple of hours, maybe about five to six hours late swedish time
so don't forget to hit the notification so you know when i am live
otherwise than that, i wish you will have a great tuesday, and we see each other in later today's livestream
[Music], one second, but before i give everyone the content, hello everyone
how is everyone? is everyone feeling good today? i'm a little bit tired, but that is totally fine
if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that before we are going into the charts
lau, how are you? it's raining outside in beautiful stockholm
oh, oh, loren, where's my coffee? where's my coffee? my oatmeal is sloot
i saw this morning that i i was supposed to go on a live stream yesterday, but, uh, because the market was so slow, i thought
so, yeah, i would, i didn't go in a live stream yesterday because i just wanted the market to to move and do the right move, do whatever it was was supposed to do, because the market was so slow yesterday
i mean, it did work a lot, it did move a lot during the night
but first of all, i want to go into forex factory, just to remind ourselves of if we did have any news coming out today
i know wednesday's crazy on usd cad is also having a lot of news coming out all day
but if we go into tuesday today, i don't see anything special
so if you are a first time, uh, if you first time you look at this, i i usually go through forex factory to see if we have any special news coming out
if we go down and look at what, uh, on wednesday, you can see that we have the red boxes
and the red boxes is representing that it can affect the market, um, more than enough
how are ya? but we can go in to beat the scene, just see what happened
uh? so yesterday i also spoke, if you didn't look at my video, that i did have
um, this one, yes, bitcoin will pump, but how far? uh, i did have two different levels
i had fibonacci levels between 30, 1032k and then 34, uh, 35k
so we didn't respect the first fibonacci levels that i showed you
so now what i look for is to see if we can come back up and retest the fibonacci that i do have on the daily and that is between thirty five thousand five hundred and thirty four thousand two hundred
and if we just try to highlight what, what that, uh, fibonacci is also combined with is this previous support that that we did break
so, um, if we see, i i would not be surprised if the market is actually pulling back up to these levels
and, i mean, we can also come back up to, potentially thirty seven thousand six hundred, or thirty eight thousand five hundred, also
so i definitely believe that we can have a bigger pullback to the upside
so if we go down to the lower time frames, what i'm going, what i'm going to do is obviously try to, um, try to see if we can, or if i, because i'm, no, never a financial advisor, but if we can go and find any fibonacci levels, let's see
so one funny, fun thing, may i, i think i told you this before, um, i think i'm gonna go to uk in september, because i'm gonna go to whatever
and i was thinking, if there's any people that is from the uk, we just, we should have a meet up everyone that's from the uk
we have already talked about this, but it would be so nice to see some of you guys, um, that actually look at these live streams and follow me and subscribes
what we're gonna do? uh, first of all, i wanna see how the candlestick is looking on the higher time frames
so we did have a pretty huge, we do have a very volatile, uh, candlestick
i'm going to when it's the mid when is the us? made up? oh, my god
um, so we did have this huge push now to the upside, right? and the last 12 i was like, it's five hours left and, um, or six hours left of this candlestick
and what i'm going to do is that i drag a fibonacci from 30 420 to the highest point at 31 710
uh, i just let the market do do whatever it was supposed to do
so, yeah, i mean, we have such a volatile we could potentially, uh, okay, let me see
i think, you know, when the market is that volatile to the upside
in this case, i don't believe that we will have such a big pullback
i think we will only have a pullback on the lower time frames, and then potentially see the the move, continuation of the movement to the upside
so what i'm gonna do is that i'm just gonna connect the dots to the lower time frames
okay, so this level could be pretty good if we only see a quick pullback
so either we only come back down, i would have fixed this before
okay, so we can, if we only have a a quick pullback on on bitcoin, uh, we could potentially only retest 31 533 and, uh, 31 460, if you only have a quick pullback
because as i told you, when we've had this huge momentum, as we've had now, i don't believe that we will have like this huge pullback
i i mean, for us to come back down to, we could definitely come back down to 31 080 or 30 910, and then potential continuation
but first of all, i'm gonna look at 31 530 and 31 452, if these are the levels that we only come back down and retest
so that is the first target that i potentially can see the pullback
because remember, guys, you don't, i don't want to buy the market at the high
i need to let the market pull back down so i have a better price when when i buy the market
so even if the market does not respect these levels, if we come back down to it that, you know, trading, you will give me a notification
so at that point, i'm gonna look at how the candlestick is looking
do we sleep through it? do we um slowly? instead it come back up again? because we can also use a trend line on the high here, okay, so we connect the dots with each other, right? so we if if the market comes back down here at the fibonacci levels, you see the retest
um, and we can also use the resistance in this case that we will potentially break
but then we do the same thing on the higher time frames if we see a bigger pullback to the downside
and another thing that we also can do, if we are more sure about that market is actually potentially pulling back down to the higher time frames fibonacci instead, at 31 070, we're gonna highlight the support
and if we see the market breaking below this previous little support that we do have at 31 513, this could potentially be where you see the marcus london steady um pull back down to these fibonacci levels
so what we do is that we connect the dots with the we connect the the resistance trend line together to see if, because the market always comes back up and retest a trend line, even if it is on to the downside or to the up
in this case, if we see the pullback, we are in a the market will create lower lows and lower highs
you can see now, if we're looking at the lower time frames, we do have um
we do have, i'm not going to say volatility, but i def i mean, if i wouldn't, i would not be surprised if we have the mark, if the market comes back down to these levels
but you can also see here that what happened yesterday, we only had, so this was what was happening yesterday, and then you had this huge um spike, right? and that can definitely happen again
we just might see the market, you know, give us some lower lows, lower highs, and then you just see the market having the power again to just move and not have such a big pullback
and especially when you see the market break a a triangle like this, and from the bottom, and this is where we do expect the market to pull back up to higher targets
there's only 41 people that like this live stream, and it's 120 looking at it
please go inside and like the live stream so we can reach out to more people
so we can reach out to people and show them how to look at charts, any easy way, if you are new to the channel
today i will also have a back testing session together with you
it will be, i don't know exactly the time, uh, how to say that, but save 12 hours, 13 or 14 hours from now, i will have a back testing live stream
so that means nine times night time for me in sweden, because i don't like to go into the charts, uh, and back test around new york session, because we will have a live stream at that time
so too many people want me to look at the and of course, i also want to do that
we want to look at prices, where can we buy, or where can i buy or sell and on
so i'll say 14 hours from now, i will have my back testing live stream
okay? and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus and buy bit up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you are supporting me in big consensus by doing that
and i love to trade on buy bit, because when i hold my position for a longer time as a swing trader, it's the low fees that we want
so i gave you two levels yesterday to where the potential um, if we would have, if we would have broken the the trend line and see the movements to the downside
i told you that we need, we had to break this previous highly low what did the market do? the market came back down, retested it as a higher low, and then the continuation
that is why it's so good to wait for the for the confirmation
because when the market breaks it, that's a whole different thing
but when you say that the market only comes back down for a retest, then you, you just know, okay, i'm not gonna sell the market
you we came inside the other fibonacci levels where uh i exp i also could have expected the market to break down, because we also came back down up and retested the previous report
so that is why when i when when i talk about how important it is for actually to look at how is the market looking inside the fibonacci levels
we cannot just jump into a trade just because we have uh levels
we need to look at the level and how is the market reacting to the level? that is the most important thing
i actually like this because looking at the higher time frames, we can identify this as a fake out from the support that we did break
because we do expect the market to pull back up a little bit more
which means that now when we see the fake out on the daily chart, and you can okay, so on the two daily charts, we also have the morning star
and when we try to break the previous support, usually what the market does when it comes when they fake you out on the lower time frames, is that the market comes back down and retest the exact same uh, in this case, supports that we did break, have the fake out from
and then you see the market, uh giving you the higher low around these levels, and then you see the continuation to the upside
so another thing that we can do now on the four hourly chart is that we take a fibonacci from 1 900 to the high at 1998
we go down to the lower time frames now, and you can clearly see that the market is giving you a pullback at the moment
so we're just gonna identify the pullback with the trend line and um
now market is dropping, scalping this take fib from high to low
you could see how the market came back up and retested the 50
i mean, you can, you can always trade the market, to be honest, as long as you know what the market is doing and what type of levels we're retesting and what type of levels we are trying to reach
so right now, as i told you, we can have a pullback down to 1950 and 1937
so we just try to connect the dots also with the with the support trendline
and we can, obviously, we can, obviously play a little bit with the fibonacci
so if i see more momentum, i just drag it down, and then i will see what, which of these levels the market could potentially um retest
but i'm just gonna i'm gonna, i'm gonna use this one at 1885, first of all
and from these levels, what i do expect the market to do is obviously give me a a higher low
and we can also, if we see how, if we have it bigger, we drag it back down to 1784
so we have different higher lows where we can use the the fibonacci against
have fun with the fibonacci, because that's how you understand the levels and how to use it the next time
if you have not already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
if you want to join me on my big consensus community, laura will give you pretty soon the access to the telegram group where we talk about cryptocurrencies
people get to know each other from different and some people actually find each other in their own countries
but remember, on the chat, on the telegram chat, it's always, we always talk, uh
this chat is about, um, if you want to ask something, you have direct contact with me also, and you're more than welcome to
and from this candlestick, this red candlestick, you saw this huge push, right? and we came back
we did retest it a couple of times, and now we do try to break above it
um, okay, so i dragged a fibonacci from 3325 to the support around 19 1790
if we go down to the lower time frames, this is how it looks when the market is retesting the fibonacci levels
okay, so you can see that axs has a little bit trouble right now to break above this previous, uh, demand zone that we did have
um, but if we go down to the lower time frames, if we come back down and retest 2350 and 2266
um, this could be the the second um retest before we see the market, uh, potentially continue continuate to the upside
because if we're looking at what bitcoin and the other ones is doing, they follow each other
but, uh, another thing that we need to have in mind if this is only fake out to the upside, and we just might see the market pull back down to the support
either you go up, or you go down right? but if we see the market closing below, uh, 2417, and then potentially come back up and retest from below, that could be the beginning, potentially back down to the support, or at least a bigger pullback
another thing that we also can have in mind is that we drag a fib from the last low to the break of structure, we can come back down and retest 2245 and 2132, and then potentially see the the push it upside
and usually, as you guys already know, when we are in a range market and the market tries to break the resistance, you have the fake out market comes back down to the support again
so i don't like how the market is looking right now on axs, i'm gonna be honest
so you have, you know, you got some few scenarios of what can happen to it
as you guys know, during this morning live streams, i also like to look at use 30, because it's also a pair i trade myself
okay, so i took a fibonacci from 34, 880 back down to the support at 31, 200, 274
um, so that is the weekly and that is also a previous, uh, preview support here
we can just drag it like this, so you can see that we did break the support
um, so, yeah, i think i got some pretty good this is a pretty good setup, to be honest
if we see a movement down, we could also break this support trend line and then come up for a retest, and then start to see a continuation
we can, we can bounce in between thirty three thousand eighty two and thirty three thousand five hundred
i'm gonna use this high because if we come back up there again, if the market is supposed to go down, we usually come up and retest the the demand zone, no, sorry, the supply zone right here
so i'm actually gonna look a lot on you started today, especially when we're this high up
if we break it, if we want to be more short, we also need to break this previous support that we do have at 32 336
so i'm just gonna wait for it for us 30 to to do whatever it's supposed to do
my charger is having a does have a hard time with my, my computer when when it's charging, my computer gets really slow
and i want to punch it, but i cannot do that right okay, looking at xrp, we are retesting a previous support that we did break
if we go back in time, i want to see how it looks on the weekly chart again, because the higher time frames is always better to look at
if we're close, if this fake, if this um break that we did have, if we are coming below and close below the resistance trend line, this could definitely only been a a retest of the previous support that we did break
i still look for the market on xrp to come back down to 03300 um, because that is the, that is the law of this huge wick that we did have
i mean, base that would did have such a huge, uh, weekly candle with red candlestick last week
[Music], um, uh, christine, uh, did you forgot us dollars? no, i didn't
i was just looking at it two seconds, and i s i saw what i needed to see
what are you talking about? i was, i only looked at dxi, and i saw exactly what i needed to see in two seconds, and that's why i left it
[Music], i took a trend line from this wick, connected the dots, never cut any candles
the market came exactly up and retested the trend line, took fibonacci from 3190 back down to the support at 2236
market created higher highs and higher lows on on its way up to this target support trendline, last hurry alone
or this is actually where we see the market breaking below, uh, 2666
break below that could give us the lower low, potentially come back up and give us the lower high
and that can actually be where you see the market having the momentum back down
i wouldn't do anything at the moment, because we are right now retesting the previous higher low, which means that, as i told you, you can have another push back up, or you have the break retest and then the continuation down
so when we look at dxi, you can see that we're coming back down, and we tested 50, where the higher low can potentially be
so now when we see that dxi is having a moment, a little bit of a momentum to the upside, that's when bitcoin and ethereum is going down, right? and the same thing with you is 30
so we do have a pr a previous support that we did break at night, 101700
if we see the market close above this level, and you see retest, this could be the beginning of the options
um, we will not see bitcoin have the more the momentum back up, right? because if dollars go up, usually the market is going down on bitcoin
but i would first of all want to see if we're breaking the above this level
if you can already see that, we also did break the last lower high
and the last lower high was against the 50 percent at 101560 or 70
um, so yeah, if, if, if this is where the dollar starts to continue back up, this is where we will see bitcoin go down
so do we have any fibonacci levels at the moment that we're retesting? i just want to see it
oh, if we drag fib from 36 016 back down to the week that we have at 25 300, we are right now inside fibonacci levels
and, yeah, so this is also something that i wanted to show you
if we just go back in time and see what happened before the market had another push to the downside, if we focus on what's happening right here
you see that happening right here, right to where the price is
can you see? you have this huge momentum from the resistance trend line, but we are still in a heavily downtrend here too, right? you see so much volatility to the downside
so this could actually be where the market is doing the exact same thing over here, right here
so you know what? i'm actually gonna look at the charts today from a very bearish perspective
i will want, i want to see if we, if this is actually where the drop happens
okay, so how did it look if you go back in time? do do [Music]
so looking at bitcoin, we have the support trend line that is representing the the option, right? if you break it, i just might start to look at self positions because we are inside the fibonacci level at the moment
and so what what we can see that this, it could be fake out, and then a probably drop
because i still believe that we can come back down to twenty, five thousand, three, two hundred again, at least come back down to the support
we definitely have to wait and see, um, what the market's gonna do
so if and if we also connect the dots on ethereum, from this high that we did have from the 15th of may, connected with the previous high, marquee, came exactly up and retested the trend line also
so it looks like we can actually have a bearish, bearish date today
if we go back in time, use this support, that's the same thing
if you break below 1946, and when you see the retest from up, from below
that is definitely a sign that we, that we go down, that would go down
uh, do you stream every day, same time? just know when? oh, yeah, so, uh, i do have these morning live streams every single day, eight am, swedish time
it depends on how the market is, uh, how the market is moving
but i like to go on the live streams at the end of new york session, because that's when we have, you that that's when we usually have the best um volatility
so at the end of, at the end of london's, uh, no, at the end of new york session, i used to go that
i also will have, from, like, 14 hours from now, i'm not sure how to say that, my clock time, um, but from 14 hours from now, i will have a back test and live stream together with you guys
i'm gonna end it this live stream now, because i need to go and do some content for twitter and tick tock
so thank you so much guys for being on this, being on this live stream together with me
even though i'm no financial advisor, but this is how we we can we learn from the live charts
you can go back in the live stream, but if you have not already liked this live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people

because everyone sees the chart in differently different um ways
and we are everyone is in different levels when it comes to trading
my name is josh, and today, in just a few hours, we're going to see a monthly candle close for ethereum and for bitcoin
so in just a moment, i'm going to be explaining exactly what this means for bitcoin and ethereum, because the rsi is below the 50 line, which doesn't happen very often on the monthly chart
and i will also be covering some other important bitcoin charts in just a moment, alongside talking about the stock market later in this video, definitely stick around
first of all, if you're looking at the daily bitcoin charts, looking at this bitcoin fractal i've been covering over the past few days, we are still perfectly playing out this fractal
and in case you are new to this channel, these white bars are simply previous price action that i copied from what we saw in the middle of last year, and i've overlaid that on top of what we're seeing at the moment
and you can see that the price of bitcoin over the past one month or so has been heavily correlated to what we saw around the middle of last year, looking at may and june in particular
and so if this simply continues to play out like what we saw in the middle of last year, we could actually see a pullback in the price of bitcoin within the next week or so, and potentially come back below 30 000 per bitcoin
and in that case, i'll be looking towards around 28 and a half thousand as strong support
but even the bitcoin price coming back down and revisiting around 25 to 26k, that original low that we set a few weeks ago, that scenario is not out of the picture, because if you're looking at what happened in the middle of last year, we actually revisited the original low two other times before then we bottomed out and began a bullish reversal
but it is important to mention that just because something happened in the past, it does not guarantee it's going to happen the exact same in the future
in fact, it's unlikely things will play out the exact same but we could see something similar, which is why it's still important to at least consider this fractal
and taking a quick look at the twoday bitcoin chart, obviously we still have this active bullish divergence in play, which shows us that we're seeing reduced bearish momentum
and obviously, i've been talking about that over the past few weeks, ever since that original low at around 25k
and the last significant bullish divergence here on the two day bitcoin charts that we saw was back in the middle of last year, which is once again, another similarity between what we're seeing at the moment and what we saw last year
but now zooming all the way out to the monthly bitcoin charts, because in just a few hours we're about to see another monthly candle close
we're currently sitting at around 48 at the time of recording this video
and unless we see something like a 10 000 pump in the price of bitcoin in the next few hours, which is extremely unlikely, it's very likely that this rsi on the monthly chart is going to close at the end of the month below that 50 line, so basically in the lower half of the rsi and there's only ever been three other times in bitcoin's entire price history that that has happened
obviously, that one monthly candle closed during march 2020, and then also at the end of the 2018 bear market and at the end of the 2014 bear market
and if you actually look at what happened during those previous time periods where we saw the monthly bitcoin rsi drop into the lower half of the rsi indicator, obviously, during the march 2020 crash, we just saw the one monthly candle close with the rsi below 50, and then we bottomed out and immediately recovered
but a scenario like that is not exactly likely, because in that scenario we saw the fed drop interest rates and print a lot of money
and they're basically doing the opposite of that at the moment
so instead, if we look at the end of the 2018 bear market and end of the 2014 bear markets, first of all, during 2018, at the first monthly candle close below 50, that was almost at the bottom of the bear markets, but we still actually formed one more lower low the following month
so we basically had one more month worth of downside price action, and then the bitcoin price bottoms out for the bear markets
and if you'll simply dollar cost averaging into bitcoin at that stage, just there while the monthly bitcoin rsi was in the lower half of the rsi indicator, the next bitcoin pump returned over 300 with no leverage
and now if you're looking at the 2014 bear markets, at the first monthly kennel closed below 50, we actually saw a slight dip below 50 in the monthly rsi, and then the very next month was slightly above 50, and then we dropped below 50 again
so if you're going off the first actual monthly kennel close in the irs site below 50, the very next monthly candle was a green monthly candle
and then we had two more months worth of red, before then we bottomed out for the bear market
so basically, after that close with the rsi below 50, we still had another three months, in total, before the bottom of the bear market, and then we entered into a consolidation range and another bull market
so according to many years worth of bitcoins history, and according to the monthly bitcoin rsi, the most bullish scenario possible that we have seen in the past is basically a bottom for this monthly candle close, and then we begin a bullish reversal back to the upside during june, which is like what we saw in march 2020
but that is a slightly less likely scenario, just based on what we saw during that time in the world
and then perhaps more of a realistic scenario is like what we saw in 2018, where we had a monthly candle close with the rsi below 50, and then we still had one more month where we made a new lower low in the price of bitcoin, and then we bottomed out for the bear markets
but keep in mind, at the end of the 2018 bear market, after we already hit the bottom, we still had another two to three months worth of sideways consolidation, give or take, before then we entered a significant bitcoin pump
so if we simply repeat a scenario like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear market, we could form another lower low in the price of bitcoin, meaning that bitcoin could drop below 25k sometime in june, and then we could enter a sideways consolidation leading into july and perhaps august, and then more of a bullish recovery sometime around august, september, october, that sort of time period
and then, technically, the worst case scenario for bitcoin, according to what we've seen around this indicator throughout bitcoin's history, is something like what we saw during 2014 and 2015, where we still have another couple months worth of potential downside price action
so in that case, it might not even be until around july august where we actually reached the bottom for a bear market
and then, going off what we saw in 2015, we could see a massive sideways consolidation, just basically a huge range of accumulation that could even last towards the end of this year
if we see a scenario like this, which will technically be the worst case scenario according to the three other times throughout bitcoin's history, where we've seen the monthly bitcoin rsi drop below 50
and just to gauge market sentiment, let me know in the comment section down below, out of those three options, what you think is the most likely to occur
because usually if everyone thinks one particular scenario is going to play out, it doesn't end up playing out like, for example, 100k bitcoin last year
but anyway, zooming right into the four hour bitcoin chart, and this is the descending triangle pattern i've been talking about over the past few days
and obviously, if you've been keeping up to date with my videos, you will know that the technical price target for these patterns to the upside is coming in at around 32 and a half thousand
and so far, the bitcoin price at the time of recording in this video has reached around 324 k
but once again, as i mentioned in yesterday's bitcoin update video, in a trade like this, i'll be moving my stoploss further into profits to secure a profitable trade in case things reverse unexpectedly
so either way, from the point of the breakout right here, this has definitely been a great trade if you long to this move
but while we're here, on the four hour bitcoin charts, something important to mention is the fact that we're currently seeing a bearish divergence form
because on the four hour bitcoin chart, we've seen higher highs in the bitcoin price action, but lower highs in the four 4hour bitcoin rsi
and this is a signal to us that bitcoin, at least on this shot to move, is losing bullish momentum
so we could end up seeing a bit of sideways price action, or a slight pullback, perhaps, down to this level of support right here, which was previous resistance
but usually when we break above previous resistance, that flips into new support
and in case you missed my last video on the channel, this level is coming in at around 30 700 as a possible point of support
and aside from that, we could find some shortterm support at around 313 to 314 k
considering we did find some shortterm resistance at around that level in the past, during the middle of may, but it wasn't that much
so that level simply isn't as important as that 30 dollar level
and just before we head into the ethereum charts today, taking a quick look at the us
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the four hour time frame
and over the last one week or so, i've been talking about these bullish diversions on the four hour chance for the nasdaq 100 index
and obviously, over the past one week, that has played out very well
but considering the fact that this is only on the fourhour timeframe, it's not extremely significant, and normally doesn't play out very long
because, generally speaking, the larger the time frame, the larger the pattern, which means the longer it's gonna take to play out
but normally, when it comes to a four hour bullish divergence, i expect these sort of patterns to play out over the next few days, maybe up towards around a week or so
and we've basically already seen that play out over the past one to one and a half weeks
and so i wouldn't be expecting these bullish diversions to play out much longer, which means we'll have to start forming some other bullish signals in order to see more bullish price action on the charts
and if you zoom out to the daily time frame for the nasdaq 100 index right now, we're forming a w pattern, which is very similar to what we saw during march this year
and in fact, if you're looking at the overall price action that we saw in the first quarter of this year, in the first couple weeks of january, we saw a dump in the stock market, and then a bit of a shortterm bounce, and then a further dump to the downside into a slightly bigger bounce, and then one more dump to the downside, and then we formed a derby pattern, which led into a decent rally in the stock market during the last month of the first quarter
and now if you're looking at the second quarter this year so far, obviously we saw a dump in the first couple weeks of the second quarter, and then we saw a bit of a shortterm bounce, and then a further dump to the downside into a slightly bigger bounce, and then one more dump to the downside into a w pattern
and now we're heading into the last month of the second quarter, very similar to the last month of the first quarter
now obviously, this is just a bit of speculation based on fractals, but we are looking extremely similar to what we saw in the first quarter of this year, especially during the end of the first quarter and now leading into the end of the second quarter
which means if the nasdaq 100 index follows along with the same fractal as what we saw in the first quarter of this year, then we could end up seeing a bit more of a rally at the end of the second quarter, so basically during june
and if that plays out, we could see some more bullish price action for bitcoin and ethereum, considering both bitcoin and ethereum are heavily correlated to what the nasdaq 100 index is doing
and speaking of ethereum, taking a look at the daily ethereum chart, which is still playing out an active bullish divergence, which once again means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, at least in the shorter term
and if you're looking at the last bullish divergence of this size on the daily time frame, so basically one that's stretched over a couple weeks or so, then that will take us back to march, which is very interesting, because during that time period, that is obviously the time period that i just discussed for the stock market, where we basically saw a one month rally in the stock market, which led into a one month rally for ethereum and bitcoin
so that is why it is important to keep an eye on what the stock market is doing
but otherwise, if we don't see a decent rally in the stock market, like what we saw during march, i would mostly be expecting more sideways, choppy price action for ethereum based on this bullish divergence
and now zooming all the way out to the monthly ethereum charts
because obviously ethereum is about to see a monthly candle close in just a couple hours
and at the time of recording in this video, the monthly bitcoin rsi is currently below 50
so it's very likely we're about to see our first monthly candle close with the rsi back below 50, in the lower half of this indicator, for the first time since 2020
and considering the fact that ethereum wasn't even around during the 2014 bitcoin bear market, we only have the one significant bear market for ethereum, which was 2018
and if you're looking at the first monthly candle close during the 2018 bear market, where the rsi for ethereum was below 50, on the monthly time frame that was on this candle right here
and we still had another three months worth of red before then ethereum bottomed out for the bear markets
and unfortunately, we don't have many other data points for ethereum to go off, because ethereum simply doesn't have the history that bitcoin has
dollar is heavily correlated to what bitcoin is doing against the us
dollar, which means if, for example, bitcoin bottoms out, let's just say, during june, and then we enter a bullish recovery into july and august, it's very likely we could see something very similar for a theorem against the us
but then it becomes a question of whether or not a theorem is underperforming or outperforming bitcoin, which i'll be talking about in just a moment
but looking at the four hour ethereum charts, and obviously, over the past one day, we've seen a breakout above this horizontal line, which was previous support and then flipped into new resistance
and that is coming in at just above 1900 per ethereum, around 1910, approximately
technically, we have confirmed two small touch points along this level, just here, coming in at around 2000
and anything above that, we have a slightly more significant level of resistance, coming in at around 2060
but i would also be keeping an eye on the fourhour ethereum rsi, which briefly entered into overbought territories
and now over the past half a day or so, it has been seeing a slight pullback, which has resulted in some weakness in the price of ethereum in the shorter term
if we see more of a down transforming in the 4 hour rsi, that could be a bit of a bearish signal for ethereum
and we would likely retest this level, coming in at around 1900
and if we confirm a break below that level again, then it's very possible we could revisit this low down here at around 17 to 18 hundred dollars per ethereum
and now taking a look at the ethereum versus bitcoin charts on the threeday timeframe
and honestly, nothing much has happened over the past couple days
but other than that, pretty much everything that i said in my last video on the channel is still valid as of today
and the same can be said about the bitcoin dominance chart as well
we're still in a clear uptrend, pumping to the upside, which is not good for the altcoin market compared to bitcoin
and obviously, this is good for bitcoin compared to the old coin market, which is why i've said over and over for weeks now on the channel that i am simply heavier into bitcoin than alt coins at the moment, at this stage in the market
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
hey, what's going on guys? it's matt, and i'm back with another bitcoin update
so bitcoin is starting to take off, so let's talk about that and much more
and so before i start, as always, drop like and subscribe if you'd like to see more crypto updates like these
and for those that want to join my public trading community, would like to gain access to additional trading guidance, which includes indepth live streams that i have with members multiple times per week, then you can check out one of the links provided in the description of this video
now, on the four hour market structure, as i discussed in the latest update, what is likely to occur with bitcoin is that we're going to have a liquidity grab below the bottom of this range, or at least from a probable standpoint, it's much more likely to happen
so we were trading, if i play this back, we were trading sideways for a number of days
and one thing that popped out to me right away is the fact that we started forming these equal lows, or similarly, price lows
okay, they don't have to be at the exact perfect price, but whenever you start to see two or three, maybe four, different lows or highs that are within a very tight price region, you have to consider the fact that these levels usually get targeted for liquidity, where the price action pushes into these levels
any traders in there gets squeezed out, whether it's the majority of retail traders or smaller institutions, that we're unfortunately on the wrong side of the the momentum
and then, once enough orders are gathered up, if i play this forward, once that happens, and it happens relatively quickly, right? so we weren't trading there for a long period of time
as soon as that happened, we did push back into this region one more time
so we never pushed to the lowest low, or we never actually pushed below that low right? this is the region where the majority of discounted prices would reside
and i did discuss this in my trading community where i was looking to buy bitcoin
and so this is a setup that i had, i actually have had, i actually had multiple take profit points
but i was looking to buy bitcoin knowing that, okay, if enough liquidity is gathered up over here, well, then where's the next region that we're going to push into? well, that's where we're going to push above this range, okay? because going on to the daily market structure
we've have been pretty overextended, or pretty over sold over the last couple of weeks
and i know that a lot of people look at the rsi as something that is a lagging indicator
and although that is true, it can lag where if you have a strong trend, it can continue pushing downwards
but just taking a look at the market structure on the weekly chart, this is the monthly range that we were trading inside of
and we never had a significant close below the lows of, uh, well, the middle of 2021, so last summer
so once i noticed that we spiked below these lows, but we never closed below them
and the last two weekly candles, despite being bearish, never quite again close below these lows
i understood that the bearish pressure, although it was there, it was starting to slow down
now does this mean that we're going to drop back down, uh, to the bottom of this range immediately? i personally don't think so
now, we could drop back into at least the midpoint of this range, right? because this is where we do have a price and balance residing right inside here
so that's basically where the midpoint of this daily range is
so if we were to correct a little bit, which it looks like the price action is starting to stall, and this is where i took partial take profits, then that could, of course happen, where we once more push down into here
but then again, as liquidity is gathered up, as more discounted prices are entered for bitcoin, that would fuel the next rally upwards
so this is what i'm paying attention to, if we do correct a bit deeper
and if we don't, well, then another scenario can simply occur where we push back down into this small region where we've previously been consolidating in
so you could push back into here, you would have a break and retest of this daily range, and then you could go long
we're not going to know to an exact certainty as to what will happen next, but that's simply what happens when you get a little bit when you jump in a little bit later
so i understand that a ton of people are probably eyeing bitcoin, saying, okay, i need to buy right now
now that doesn't mean that you need to catch the exact bottom, because that's relatively hard to do
you have to stay patient, wait for this to come to you in order to give you a better discount
and as far as what might take profit shows, i have the next one marked up at around 34 000
that's because on the daily chart, this would line up around the 50 ema
and on the four hour if i mark that out with this line, looking to the left, we can see this is the last supply zone
so this is where the price action consolidated on may 8th, and roughly may 7th as well
but if the price action continues to rally, then i believe we could push into this level
and beyond that point, the region that i'm paying more attention to is if i take out the volume profile connect from may 4th
so basically the size of this entire impulsive, uh, bearish, impulsive move that we've had for the month of may
then the next region that i'm paying attention to is this price and bounce, this major price and balance that stretches between 374 all the way up to around 39 000
so let's narrow this down between 374 all the way up to 381 000
so that was a quick drop down where any orders entered there weren't officially entered
and so this is my overall outlook for bitcoin over the next upcoming days
so it's a pretty bullish end to the month of may, and this could very well extend into the month of june
so we have to keep in mind that this current weekly candle still has a couple of days left to close, but it's likely going to close bare bullish, either the way that it is right now, or much higher
and of course, this is going to be, in two hours, our most significant daily close in a number of days
so this is the largest daily candle, if it closes like this, the largest one that we've basically had in a couple of weeks
so that's very good for those that are looking to see a larger correction, which i am more likely to expect, at least for the first half of june
so we should position ourselves in that direction, especially as shortterm traders, because that gives us uh, that would give us better trade setups from a risk to reward perspective

in this episode, we're taking a look at the bitcoin price on the two hourly
on the one hourly, we can see that we are getting this reaction at the 30 500, 30 600
as you can see, it was a big, major level that we were talking about, all the way down here, looking for that leg up and that reaction at this range
now your question might be, where is the bitcoin price going to go? because i have a very important level here at the 32 000 area, where the price could get a massive reaction and potentially continue to the downside
i'm going to show you a similar fractal that did happen here in december of 2021, gaining the last lower high from a big, major drop, as you can see here, and failing to attempt to continue to the upside and continue to back down
i'm going to show you the similarities for any people that haven't been following my latest videos
and we're also taking a look at, a quick look at the s p 500, because i've been bullish from the s p 500 all the way down here, from the 3900 points, looking for that leg up
where we could be getting heavily rejected, because there's a lot of confluence at that level

because we have been talking about this situation yesterday, where we were look i was looking for that potential big move up to this major level, this liquidity grab above these highs over here, which is around about the 30 600 approximately
why are we getting consolidation? because it's a big, major resistance level
price action has been stopping there many, many times for the last 20 days
and it's the value area high, as you can see on the volume profile
so it's going to be very difficult for the price to actually break above this range
but i do see it attempting to have that leg up, because we've retested this range so many, many times that i do think a potential breakup from this zone is very likely in the coming hours, between today and tomorrow, potentially
now, the reason why i was bullish at this range, i did explain this on my latest videos, we had a big, massive wick to the downside, and this is telling me that the big, massive selling pressure is getting bought back up below 28 600
and i did get in on this retracement thinking that the prize was very likely to fail again and get that big, massive bounce break in here the lower highs and going to our next big, major resistance level, which was the thirty thousand five hundred dollar range, where we were going to get that stop
now what i want to show you here is that we are maybe going to have another leg up
now, of course, after a consolidation at a major resistance level, it can get heavily rejected
because, as i said, you know, i think that we could have one more last leg up to the next big liquidity grab, which would be this level over here, at round about the 32 000 area, okay, where we have seen major resistance
as you can see, how many weeks here on the two hourly, not managing to get above this level
okay? and then continuing to the downside, this is also a major weekly level
if i go to the weekly, we can see that it was a weekly close and open on july, as you can see, right over here
okay, we've got these candle closes, which is at the 32, 31, 770, approximately
what i want to see here maybe in the next coming hours, couple of days, if we do manage to break above this level, i am waiting for that reaction in the next few days, two, three, four days, depending on, you know, it all depends
if we do can't have a consolidation at this level, what i do see is a big, major liquidity grab above these highs
okay? make sure to eye this situation on bitcoin where you have the last lower high zone, okay? after this big, major drop, consolidation, you start breaking some lower highs here, and then you have that potential leg up to the last big lower high
and this is what i want to explain right over here on bitcoin
what happened in december of 2021, where we did have a pretty large drop, okay, going from the 58 000 region all the way down to the 41 000, over a 15 000 drop
and what most of the people expect is coming back down to retest the lows here, where you start breaking resistance levels
and what happens is that you start retesting the last lower high zone here, and fail to break this range
now what i want to show you is that something similar could happen to bitcoin, right over here
now, of course, if we do break out from this big, major zone, the thirty thousand five hundred, thirty thousand six hundred, okay? give or take a couple of hundred dollars, because of the volatility, getting that reaction, if we ever do, if we do have a solid breakout with big volume, there is a high possibility, and that if we do correct after this big, massive pump, if we do have a strong four hourly candle well above this area with high volume, we could potentially come down and retest this big, massive zone where we do have the valiary high and has been a big resistance level
and this is something similar that i do see on bitcoin, that did happen in december of 2021, where you did break out from a major resistance zone, as you can see, retesting the last lower high from the drop, getting that rejection, getting that kind of m pattern, swing failure pattern right over here
so this is also a possibility for bitcoin, when we are going to get this reaction from this level
if we do successfully break out here, this 30 600 range, you could get a retracement, get one bounce here
and then on this attempt is where i will be interested and to see what would happen to the price of btc for potentially shorting the market
but if we start making this kind of price action, i am looking for these major, strong levels, the 32 000 range, okay, where we could have some volatility and a big retracement
and the 30 500 range here also where we could be getting those bouncers, as you can see here on the chart, big major levels
then the next major leg up is where i'm looking for that potential swing failure pattern, that double top scenario, for the price of bitcoin to potentially continue back to the downside, even coming as low as the 25, 26 000 range
so this is something that i am iron okay, not much to add on bitcoin, because it is possible that we could actually get rejected from this zone
it is such a strong level, as you can see here on the chart, value area high, big resistance zone, that the possibility and actually coming down from this level is also high
so this is why i'm still in this long position, taking profits here, most of my profits at this level
if we come here to the 32 000 range, this would be my take profit too
and i would be starting to look for short positions at this range
if we do have several retests and a big consolidation, that is how i see the market guys
now, if i zoom out here on the two hourly chart, we could go, as you know, to the full hourly chart
just to zoom out a little bit, what i want to show you here is the big, major drop that did happen here on bitcoin, okay, from this large consolidation that we did have, okay, in april, as you can see, and starting to drop in may
this is where you would get the fibonacci retracement, okay? because this is where the drop really starts
and if we take a look at fib levels, we're looking, okay, to the 50 range, all right? we are hitting the 382 at this moment
if i do zoom it, zoom in from this high level on the 4th of may, all the way down here to the low of the big major drop, the 382 is exactly right over here
so if i did do take a look at the last lower high, okay, which is this one over here, around about the 32 500, it is also 50 fibonacci
so this is why, i do think claiming this high and getting this kind of reaction, hitting 50 fibonacci, you know, 32 000, 32 500
is that volatility range, consolidating, consolidation that i would be interested in, potentially showing the market to continue this big, massive downtrend
okay, so this is something that i'm going to talk about in the next coming days, guys
so make sure to stay tuned, smash up the like button subscribe to the channel, because i will also be doing live streams every single day around about 9 10 am
now, let's take a look at the s p 500, because the s p 500 is also looking pretty good in the last few days
let me just take a look here, from the low levels, in just around about a week or so, we have pumped about 10 percent, almost 10 percent, all right, in a week
and this for the stock market, traditional s p 500, is quite a big pump
okay, so now is people starting to becoming bullish, or are we looking for that next lower, high level, all right, where we could be getting heavily rejected? and this is what i want to explain here on the s p 500
okay, round about this range, give or take, you know, 10, 20 points
so we have seen several bounces as support and as resistance on in the past
major resistance levels here at the beginning of may, end of april
i was quite bullish on the s p 500, all right, from these low levels, getting this consolidation, i was thinking, this is very likely to be a sharp pattern, and we might gonna get that leg up
and here we are, having that leg up, almost hitting the 4 points
i just want to let you know that i have closed my s p 500 position here on primex bt, and i'm already looking for shorts on s p 500
if you are interested in trading s p 500, dow jones, oil, gold, use bitcoin or ethereum or usdt or usdc
you get seven percent added to your deposit for trading, which is an absolute great bonus
if you are interested in trading in this platform, of course, only for experienced traders
and if we go here to the s p 500, what i am looking for, okay, this shark pattern is a bearish pattern
okay? this bearish shark is a bearish pattern where we should be potentially hitting that 4200, 4230 points approximately, where we could start getting a reaction, a little bit of volatility, like i showed you in the past
and if i take a look at fibonacci retracement from this peak over here, which would be the ideal fib level from this high to the low, we can see that the 50 fibonacci retracement would be around about that hundred and 4204 points approximately here
it would be the d point on the sharp pattern, which is the point 88 and the point one, six, one eight
okay, from this actual pump over here, which is, you know, massive confluence right over there
so this is why, also we've got fifty percent fibonacci retracement, we've got the bearish shark pattern, we've got a major zone where we have had big, major bounces
that is enough confluence for me to think that the price of the the s p 500, okay? would come down, okay, potentially to at least this b point over here, and maybe slightly lower, which would be around about the 4080 points in the next coming days, maybe by next week, depending on how long we are going to consolidate here at round about the 4 250 points
i am looking for that potential another leg up here on the s p 500, and getting exhausted
all right? we've also got this major resistance from these lower highs
check out these lower highs here from the 30th of march, also the 5th of april
also right over here, on the 21st of april, we've got the lower high trend line
and it's also round of that region, okay, of the 4230 points, approximately
that zone is where i'm looking for a potential reaction, and maybe the s p 500 starting to come back down again
let's see if we do get that reaction, because there's also the possibility that you might slice through this level
okay? only if we consolidate at this range is when i would potentially be bearish
we've been talking about this scenario on bitcoin where we could actually come all the way up here to retest this 32 000 range
but there is a possibility also that we might just slice through this range very, very fast
so i wouldn't be interested in shorting if we absolutely have this, you know, insane bearish momentum
only if the price stops and tries to break this level multiple times is the moment that i will see that the demand is getting exhausted
and then obviously the price should be coming down after that reaction

and i'm going to explain why we did have this move for bitcoin, for any newcomers, for any people that didn't, you know, that missed the latest videos, the latest live stream, talking about my highest probability of potentially getting this bounce all the way to this range after this big, massive wick that we did create
okay, just a few days ago, this was also mentioned on yesterday's live stream
this was yesterday's live stream, looking for that potential move to the upside to hit that 30 500 range
this was on yesterday's live stream, looking for that potential move to the upside
looking for that move to the 30 500 range, which was my first target
are we going to manage to successfully go to the target 2, which is round about the 32 000 area? okay, 31 700, 31 800, you could have some volatility and potential reaction at that range, maybe in the next coming hours, maybe in the next coming days, or maybe you're just going to get hardly rejected from this range
why? because you're at the value area high from the volume traded for the last 20 days, almost here
it's a level that bitcoin hasn't managed to break, resistance
so does this mean, are we going to break it? no, you know, we could or we can't
you know, all depending on how we react in the next coming hours, or potentially a couple of days
if we start staying at this level in the next couple of days, then this is going to be bearish
if we have multiple attempts of the price action trying to break this 30, 500, 600 range
but if you start seeing failed attempts in breaking above, it's very likely going to continue back down
okay? this is the moment i am taking profits from the long position, of course, and i am looking for potential shorting opportunities this area, or this area at the 32 000 range
okay? that is how i can see what is happening here on the market
now, of course, my position here that i entered in along, and i had a lot of people saying, you know, this is going to go, this is going to break support
but this is why you risk a small percentage of your portfolio
i really hardly want to explain this, because it is important to explain why
why did you enter? why did you have your take profit there? because, yeah, some random youtubers just might say, okay, i'm long in here because i think we're gonna go here, or, you know, or whatever
we already, you know, almost hitting that target that we'll go through also today
the s p 500, the shark pattern, looking for that four thousand two hundred, four thousand two hundred and fifty points since we were at the three thousand nine hundred
and i'll go through that right now, just for for um, any people that are new, actually, any of any new subscribers, any people that have missed out the live streams
good explanation why or also, why the s p 500 did actually pump from those levels
and reason number two that i entered a long position was this swing failure pattern
okay? of course, you come down and you retest, and you have this little bit of volatility, all right? because, you know, you need to get extremely scared
this is the actual, you know, the the um, the selling pressure, okay, uh, getting bought back up from the buying pressure, right? big, massive wick, massive failed attempt in breaking these lows
i entered here at the the retracement of um, the the 618 fibonacci retracement
we've got a beautiful bounce here to perfection from the zone, you know, fibonacci 618
it was totally fine stoploss below this wick this week over here is my saver
why was it all the way up here? because we are range trading in between twenty eight thousand six hundred and thirty thousand five hundred dollars
meaning if we do have a failed attempt here, the most likely scenario would be coming all the way up to the strongest level
we're going to stop here at the strongest level, which is the 30 500 range
we hit this level, we could actually correct from this level, because it's the strongest level
very important to talk about risk to reward because, you know, i see so many people, you know, randomly getting into 50, 100 x positions
i'm only using um, yeah, not even a 10x in this position, um, which is already quitting pretty good leverage
i mean, this pump over here on bitcoin from these levels, from these lows, you know, it's already a seven percent pump
if you're using 8 10x leverage, you know, that's already a 60, 70 percent move to the upside, which is totally fine
but first of all, if you enter here at 28 600, and you have your stop loss right over here, you are risking this amount
if my target's all the way up here, you know, the risk to reward is almost three to one
and you know, you potentially going to have a risk to reward four or four and a half
okay? because this is potentially a target that we can reach, after retesting multiple times, this thirty thousand, five hundred dollar range
you know, we've tested it so many times that this might have the enough steam, the bulls might have enough steam to come all the way up here at the 32 000 range, where we do have a very strong weekly level, and we have this big, massive reaction that we had on the 10th, on the 11th of may, as you can see here, i am expecting the price here to not successfully break above 32 000
and i will be looking for short positions at that level, only if we do have a reaction, only if we see the selling pressure, you know, kicking harder than the buying pressure
and here you do have a confirmation, or, as you can see here on the two hourly, you can go to the one hourly, if you wish, of breaking the trend here from lower highs, as you can see, confirming that you are potentially going to have that move up here to the upside
s p 500, if i do have a few minutes, i want to, i want to explain how this is starting to be a very risky range where you could get heavily rejected
and this is also a second reason, not as strong a second reason, why bitcoin was potentially going to have that bullish shortterm momentum

um, i mean, i'm planning to make a, make one for the community
okay, are really, really good technical analysis from john murphy, you know, really, really technical
it doesn't matter who is the the, actual, um, you know, writer of the book
also, i would go with books because there's a little bit of too much information on youtube with um trading
so, yeah, if you wait a few months, i would be getting a course out
tomorrow, the wall street will open with a massive money transfer to nasdaq and s p 500
so just imagine how, how percentage will btc fall? um, well, yeah
i mean, this is the thing, um, i'm, i'm not sure about the fundamentals, but this has already been a, a big interest for me for looking for shorts, you know, in between 4 200 and 4 250 range where i do see this, you know, shark pattern
it doesn't mean we need to break up, so we could hit resistance and get a big, massive correction here on the s p 500
now, where is there? this is a bearish pattern, okay? this very shark pattern that we have been talking about on the s p 500 since the 23rd, 22nd, 23rd of may
let me just, let me just show you here, the the targets from the shark pattern
very important, this shark pattern over here, the target's first target number one would be the 50 618, from b to c, okay? in this case, from c to d
so from this low to this high, it's very, very likely that the s p 500, or depending on where we finish, you you are potentially going to correct all the way down to the 50 level, which is the 4 000 range
okay? so, um, yeah, looking for that potential target six, one, eight would be the ideal target
even target number two would be coming all the way to the low c point here to retest the lows, which is very possible
so, yeah, i think i'm slightly bearish on the s p 500 in the next coming days, of course, uh, because, yeah, after a big, massive pump, guys
but, yeah, being bullish from this level, being bearish from from this range, uh, let's have a bullish week
this time, i believe we'll have a it after stock exchange move, yeah, uh, probably, probably
i think maybe a couple of more days of bullishness, and then a pretty sharp correction if bitcoin does reach, i mean, we already get getting this crazy reaction from this, thirty thousand five hundred, thirty thousand six hundred dollars, where we could have that retracement
we are very, very likely, you know, maybe going to get, um, a failed attempt of breaking the zone
i have taken 60 of my profits on my buy but position from the long that i did take here at twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, as you can see here on the chart, at this position, right here at twenty eight thousand six hundred, you know, already taken sixty percent of profit
my position is protected, just in case we do get that leg up to the zone
so i do have 40 of my position, just in case, you know, we do have that final leg up here to retest these levels, which i think is is very, very possible
is this pump shakeout or real deal? well, um, like i said, i was bullish from this range
i'm starting to be bearish if we do get that pump even more at this level
for any of those people there are new subscribers, or did miss out on on a video of this explanation the last few days, i'm gonna go on the four hourly chart, okay, and and show you something similar that could happen on bitcoin in the next coming days
and i'm going to show you right away that did happen in december of 2021, as you can see here
and i'm looking for something very similar to happen right over here, where we are maybe going to see continuation to the downside as soon as we hit that 32 000
if we do reach that level, uh, of course, i will only be, um, i will only trade it if we do get a reaction
i just want to show you the similarities of this price action
let me just take the the chart here on by bit and and and zoom in, so we can go through the similarities of this movement from the from december and today
what happened right over here? well, we did have a big, massive drop, and we had, you know, a lower high created right over here
what's happened here? we had this massive correction, and we do have a lower height, you know, still dropping more afterwards, but it's a very important zone
and if we take a look here at bitcoin um from december, you know, most of the people think that from this dead cat bounce, you are going to come down and retest these lows, right? you are going to come down and retest the lows that you did create here in december
and, yeah, basically you have a kind of an abc correction, where you have an a, a, b, a, c, and then you roll back down
and this is something similar that i think is happening right now with bitcoin, where you have, you know, this scenario over here, where you recom all the way down to 25 000, almost 25 000, okay? the low, 25 000, dead cat bounce
but you know, you, you think, from this point, most of the people, most of the people think that you are going to roll down and hit this level, okay? most of the people think you're going to roll down and hit this low
and you are actually very likely, first of all, after this scary price action, going to create a kind of a b, c correction, and then come down to these levels, the the big level
i mean, this is why i would be quite bearish if we start creating a kind of a double top at this 32 000 level
we actually did short i went, we, i'm not not we, but i did actually short this
failure right there, getting to these highs, you know, and bouncing all the way back over here, breaking this trend line, we had an important level where we could get a bounce
this level over here, thirty thousand, five hundred dollar range
okay, anything can happen at the end of the day, but you we already get getting that reaction from this level
and what is going to happen that this is such a big, strong level, the 30 500, that we could get a correction, get one bounce from this level
that is some movements that i am expecting in the next coming days, if we do manage to break above it
okay, of course, this is only pure speculation, but if we break above, there's very good opportunities from this range
we could actually correct from this level and fail to break this strong level of resistance
so, um, yeah, basically very similar, very similar price action from december
this is why i also, this is another fracture that i was saying, you know, we are very unlikely going to retest the lows from this major drop first
i think, you know, it's, it's more likely to get one more leg up and then come down to retest these lows
and you can see the similarities here on bitcoin price action in december of 2021, where you most of the people at this point, you know, think that you're gonna roll down, and you have one more last leg up to grab a bunch of liquidity from the last lower high, and then you fall down
so what this is why the biggest liquidity grab here on bitcoin would be this 32 000 range, even slightly higher, this consolidation, a liquidity grab
well, not probably not as high, but that 32 000 range, it's a major weekly level liquidity grab get, um, quite a lot of people bullish from this range, and and then finally come down and retest the the 25 000 lows
um, and that, i think that's the most probable scenario, of course
um, we, we did see a similar action here in december of 2021 on bitcoin
and that was just a quick, um, yeah, quick, um, fractal there that i wanted to show on on bitcoin that could happen, uh, inmate
that always, um, impulsive pump price in middle of night here in uk
i i guess, you know, early, uh, european time, it's, you know, between two, two o'clock, five o'clock in the morning
and, and, yeah, we just do, i do see there is a lot of price action
uh, hey, andy, how are you doing, my man? i'm doing very good
sriger how are you? i think btc will jump hard, but don't listen to me, he says
and between thirty thousand five hundred and thirty two thousand dollars, it's a bearish zone
i will be bearish as soon if we start seeing some reactions and consolidation at this level
we were talking about that potential double bottom scenario if bitcoin were to behave
and we are getting that double bottom right now on on ethereum um
i'm not sure if ethereum will manage to e um to hit the two thousand two hundred dollars
if bitcoin hits thirty two thousand dollars, thirty two thousand five hundred, then i do see ethereum maybe hitting that 2 200 range
it's a very, very strong resistance zone here, as you can see on the chart
so what i am looking here is potentially to gain these highs, gain these highs over here, and and maybe roll back down
so ethereum is much weaker than bitcoin, much, much weaker than bitcoin
so, yeah, we're already hitting a clear, clear resistance zone here on ethereum
so, yeah, if if bitcoin doesn't behave, if bitcoin does start, it does start to get rejected from this zone, then, of course, yeah, uh, yeah, ethereum will follow down
okay? if bitcoin is at a big, strong resistance area at the 30 500, you know, i would stay cautious here
you know, this is a moment to start becoming bearish, not bullish
it is already, you know, looking at the four hourly, we can zoom in on the one hourly chart, it's already hitting a very, very strong resistance zone
as you can see, price action has stopped several times at this area where we are getting that slight reaction
very, very possible we'll be hitting the 618, from this high to the lows, hitting that 618 level, as you can see, getting that reaction from this zone
yeah, this is very likely going to get a corrective move if bitcoin does get corrective move from this zone
um, obviously, you know, you have to take a look at ethereum and other altcoins
um, but you know, you cannot be bullish on ethereum, or an old coin, if bitcoin doesn't have a bullish move
you cannot be bearish on ethereum if bitcoin is gonna, well, you can actually all depending on the bitcoin dominance
you know, if bitcoin looks pretty good, then i would say, yeah, ethereum can do this, because it looks pretty good also
um, i do see ethereum, you know, breaking this level, which is at the 1 900 range, and we could have a little bit of more bullish momentum to the upside
from the highs here, at the 2000 i think we could reach those levels, big liquidity grab on ethereum
i mean, the whole reason i'm drawing this is because of the liquidity grab that you need to get all the way up here to continue back down
at the moment, if we do break 1 800, and bitcoin does break five hundred, successfully thirty thousand, six hundred, you know, plus minus a few hundred dollars because of volatility, of course, successfully, my next zone is the thirty two thousand dollar area
and this is where ethereum could get that, you know, pretty nice leg up to
um, to about, um, 2100, 2150, where i expect a, you know, a liquidity grab from these highs to potentially then continue back down
that would make sense if bitcoin is going to be bullish for the next couple of days
why not? i did post something on the bitcoin sensors twitter account yesterday about shiba inu
[Music], potentially going to enter an accumulation zone right over here
and reason number one is because we got a solid range from the summer of 2021, you know, in between may and sept or almost october, where we did have this massive pump
i do see the price of shiba inu having a large multimonthly consolidation at this range
um, so, yeah, shiba inu is one of those meme coins that will survive, just like dogecoin did survive, you know, the bear market
dogecoin went up thousands of percent, you know, in 2020, um, 2021
so, um, yeah, shiba inu, dogecoin, they're going to be the meme coins that will survive
and, um, shiba inu does have an, uh, a pretty good team actually, behind working, uh, on on projects to come in the future
so it will be one of those meme coins, in my personal opinion, that will survive, of course, the bear market, and will enter a large consolidation
and i think, you know, most likely scenario with multimonthly consolidation will be from this zone of the summer of 2021
i don't see the price of of um, shiva, you know, dropping much lower from this range
so, yeah, some potential relief rallies entering into this zone, but it's gonna be large, multimonthly, you know, sideways consolidation
in my opinion, from my experience from the last cycle, that you, you need to accumulate heavily
i mean, i, i haven't got any cheaper, you know, i might gonna, i might buy some shiba eno, actually, because i know it's one of those meme coins that will survive
they do have a pretty, an excellent team and a huge community
i mean, if we couldn't take a look at the four hourly, we are basically creating a kind of, a, of a double bottom scenario
you could have a larger relief rally, but i would be start i mean, the drop that we have had is pretty aggressive
your double bottom, you could expect a large relief rally here in the coming couple of weeks
it could happen, but i wouldn't, i would, i wouldn't become extremely bullish
i would be bearish as soon as we start getting a large relief rally
in the case of shiva inu, we've got the lows here from january
we did get that reaction as soon as we broke down as resistance
and this would be a a realistic level where we could continue the downtrend
of course, i would be looking at fibonacci levels from from this consolidation right there, or from this one over here
from the highs here of april, of the 13th of april, to the lows, you've got the 382
and from this drop over here, you you've got the 618, exactly
being at this level, which is the january low here that you did create
it's going to be heavy resistance, and maybe continue back down, maybe
but, you know, if we do start getting this relief rally, i do see that the price of shiba inu getting rejected from this zone
and the confidence for the people to invest in crypto, it's not going to be that easy
i mean, this is going to be pure manipulation, pure market pumps, okay, to get people a little bit excited, and very likely continue back down if that relief rally does happen
of course, i do not know if that's going to happen, but if it does, it's a moment where i would be bearish
i am not investing in tara luna um terra luna classic is up 91 today
i mean, this is, this is the thing, you know, there will be moment you find a bottom, and there's going to be a lot of speculation
it's almost up 100, but it's down, you know, 100, also, almost 100, 99999 since, you know, uh, since last month
you know, this was a total rug pull, you know, a scam, a pyramid scheme
and look what he's done, you know, uh, over 40 billion dollars lost
so, yeah, are you going to invest in terra luna 20 when this guy that created it made a massive, big ponzi and people lost millions? yeah, no
anyway, um, let's take a look at um, uh, cardano, and then for solana, for monk
i think we are basically getting a reaction where are we getting a reaction from this? um, from this zone over here, which zone, this 35 40 level
from january of 2021, the entire month of january of 2021 was range trading in between 30 cents and third and 40 cents
the vpvr is pretty good to see the the the volume from each range
and from this range, we can see a spike in volume here on the vpvr
if cardano comes down to 15 cents, uh, i might be buying some myself
it's a very, very large area where we have been trading most of the time of 2020, you know, that 50 cent, 15 cents, 20 level
but, yeah, if that does happen, worst case scenario would be around about that 15 range, in my opinion, on cardano in this bear market, where we would enter very nice accumulation zone
cardano also one of those l ones that i think will survive in in the next runup
anyway, talking about the shortterm scenario here on cardano, we're actually getting that bounce from this range
so relief rally, best case scenario, relief rally on cardano would be coming up to the 80 cent level
this is if, you know, we are going to have really bullish momentum in stock market
best case scenario in the short term, couple of weeks for cardano, would be having a leg up to, um, 80 cent level
and, you know, you're starting to get that spike here at the 85 cent range
um, yeah, we would be basically hitting almost a 50 fibonacci
we have 50 fibonacci retracement from the start of the major drop created at the beginning of april till may
it's already a really good area where you're very likely going to get rejected
if you start consolidating at this level, it's very likely going to be a good short position
short term, we can see that you are, you know, we are creating this kind of double bottom
um, we did break out this zone, of course, we got supported from the four hourly close here, not managing to to break below this area
um, this four hourly closed zone, you're hitting, you know, the 618 fibonacci retracement from the actual pump that you created on the 12th of may to the 16th of may
618, 6'5 in this zone, you you're getting that reaction, four hourly close
it's a, it's a level here where you, you, you know, like i said, on bitcoin, if bitcoin did get that bounce, a lot of the altcoins, um, we'll get it
it was a major level here, and you did get that bounce to the upside
i mean, this is the thing that the owner, the owner, the creator is, yeah, he's basically made a scam coin
um, i didn't do much research on luna myself, but by the looks of i did research after everything happened
um, let's take a look at, um, i got someone here asking for matic
howmatic um i was as soon as matic did break out from this um ascending broading wedge, this is on the daily chart
zoom out all these boxes that i do have here, different colors
but ever since we broke out from this ascending broading wedge support level, this was, i remember calling for this short position on matic at the two dollar range, where we were, you know, breaking up
and this breakout of the support and the retest consolidation at this two dollar level was a great shorting opportunity right there, and and, and, who cares
zooming out on the chart, you know that that double bottom scenario is is on the way right now
look at this large consolidation on matic back here in march of 2021, and april, part of march and april here, almost two months of large consolidation before having this massive runup before the drop in may
this large consolidation is a strong level, and that is why you are getting that reaction on matic here in the immediate short term
if bitcoin does come down from this level, and it's very, very possible, if bitcoin does come down from this level, um, it's very likely going to drag matic down
what is happening right now on matic is that we are hitting the biggest point of control from this range, okay, from the range traded for the last 20 days here on matic, biggest point of control, you are getting that resistance
you're hitting lower highs, as you can see from this trend line
of course, you could have bitcoin breaking the 30 500, and that will ignite, you know, some altcoins to break resistance
and of course, if we do break this high, i do see this holding us support
where would be the biggest liquidity grab here on matic? it would be over here at this zone
and then all depending on how much it reacts at this high, that would be an insane shorting opportunity
i mean, this is the level where you would, you would be looking for a trade
i would be looking for a trade at this zone, looking for that a b c scenario
hit a liquidity zone, hit this support level and this liquidity zone from these highs
and basically, from the highs created here on on the 10th of may, to the lows, you are looking for that 618 fibonacci retracement zone, massive resistance area, liquidity grab, support level to have that continuation to the downside
so if you do break these lower highs on matic, if you do manage to break these lower highs, bitcoin looks pretty bullish
you could get one big spike up to this level, massive big, liquidity grab big, big, big resistance at 80 cents
basically, you are looking for that abc correction to that 618 level, one, two and three, only if bitcoin is bullish, only if matic has a solid breakout here, hitting the 70 cent level
okay? very likely to get one more leg up, get above these these um last lower highs
as soon as you get above these last lower highs, this is not the moment to become bullish
so if we do have that leg up to the 75, 80 cent level, i will be selling the market on matic
matter of fact, i'm gonna put an alarm here as soon as we hit 75 cents or 74 cents
as soon as we hit 74 cents, i'm going to create an alarm and see how we're going to react to this big zone over here
very likely going to get a consolidation, and the market will roll back down
in my personal opinion, uh, if bitcoin does get rejected from 30 500 here, heavily then, yeah, this will be, yeah, basically we're rolling, still rolling down
we're creating the lower highs here, getting resistance from the biggest point of control
so, yeah, i'm not looking for a trade here, because we could actually come down and retest the lows, or we could actually come up and retest this zone
that is a high probability zone where the price could roll back down
so we could actually roll down from this range, big point of control
um, yeah, i'm not, no, no trade zone for me here, just in case bitcoin does have that leg up to the 32, 32 500, we could see that leg up on on on matic if that does happen
and because this zone on on um on bitcoin, that thirty two thousand dollar range, for me, is a, a, a, an insane level for shorting
i'm only going, don't worry, because i will be doing live streams, and i will be doing videos on, you know, is it would be, would it be? time for me to short here
because what could happen also, as you might see this, you know, i think it's unlikely, but it could happen
who knows, we might have a white swan event, and the bitcoin price will pump five thousand dollars in in just a matter of hours, or or in one day
so, yeah, you know, then you get a lot of bunch of people saying, hey, you said we were gonna get a reaction here
you said we were gonna, you know, it was a shorting range, only, if only, if the price stops, comes down, comes back up, gets a reaction
and, um, when did i long and it's, you know, it's, you know, this is why how patience is is key on on on for trading
we lost the low of the twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars lost, the low closed the one hourly
this means that this the, the buying pressure is kicking in big time
it is not letting the price of bitcoin drop below, successfully, the 28 600
did i enter here? did i enter here? did i enter here? no, i waited for the price to come back down for that second retest, and that was very likely going to be failed, because you can already see the demand pressure from this wick below 28 600
so where did i enter? i entered just right there at that 28 600
it was also the 618 from the low part of the wick to the highest point
they are there to protect you and lose, you know, a small amount of of your capital, of course
if you have multiple trades like this, where you are risking this
and on most of the trades, you are trying to gain three times your stop loss
i mean, obviously you want to try and avoid and get as less stoplosses as as possible
you are going to get stopped out a few times, right? i mean, this is for an experience
but, um, anyway, just something i wanted to point out there guys
i really want to, you know, explain why, you know, why, also, why this leg up to this zone? why? why did we get this leg up to the zone? because how do you know you are going to get a reaction from this zone? well, it's just as simply as looking at this being the strongest level from this range trade for the last 20 days
and if you do start breaking these lower highs, and you fail break, you fail to break this support, you know the next level you're gonna stop
the next the liquidity is that grab zone when a lot of people gonna have stop losses
be above this range, you you're gonna, the price action is gonna come up from this level
if you had a failed breakout, especially you do have the s p 500, that will help you, you know, see that you are going to have that, you know, potential bullish momentum on bitcoin
so you start adding all of this confluence to give you a little bit of more confidence
i've got a little bit more here, just in case we do have that leg up to this area, which i do think is heavily going to get rejected
and let me take a look at fib levels from this high to the to the lows here
i mean, that's, we could get a fib level from this consolidation also to the lows, six, one, eight
but, yeah, from the big highs here, let me just go to the two hourly from the big major drop 50 is at 325
325 level is a very, very interesting zone for potentially shorting bitcoin
just out of curiosity, i want to check out with fibonacci, um, fib extension to to figure out the abc correction
i mean, no, this one does, does say fibonacci extension to say, thirty four thousand dollars
so thirty two thousand dollars zone is a major resistance zone for me
if we start reacting here at this level, if we see a price action just like this, if i do see price action like this right over here, you know, yeah, this is a that that i'm shorting this
if we start creating this kind of price action here, um, yeah, i'll be looking for shorts
um, if you, if you close 60 percent, when will you close the 40 if we get rejected now, no, i would just leave it
i would just leave it, because i do see a correction from this range
um, just below 32 000, 31 700 is where i would close the the rest of the 40 of the trade
well, litecoin is very likely to follow a lot of bitcoins movement
i don't know why you're in a short position there, but we could get a corrective move right now
and i, in my personal opinion, i do see a leg up to the thirty two thousand, thirty two thousand five hundred dollar range
and then here is where, if we do consolidate, i would be looking for shorts
there is a high possibility right now that, um, you are going to get correct from this move also, because such a strong resistance
so, yeah, i mean, this is a, this is a no trade zone in my opinion, because i, i've seen this kind of price action before where you you short this because you are in a big resistance zone
but what happens, you know, after having this nice, big bullish momentum, you know, the the the balls might step in a little bit more and and, um, to to claim these highs from the 10th and 11th of may
and that will be the moment that i will be looking for shorts
and that will be the moment i'll be closing the rest of my trade from here
i don't know if we're going to go up here, but if we do, i will be bearish
protect your capital if you have your stoploss clear, if you have your your your your target clear
i mean, if you are asking me, where if i, if i should close, uh, yeah
how many likes are we at? says, uh, mark durch, we are 316 likes
this is the only thing that i am asking, of course, because i'm only one to provide, i only want to provide educational content
explain why i think price levels can hit this range, why i would enter here, why would i would have stop loss here, and and why there is such high risk to reward on some of my positions
if you do know someone that's right 100 in the time of the times, yeah, let me know who he is, because i want to learn from that guy
and if you are experienced traders, you know the deal on buybit
this is a, you know, i do get a small commission, of course, because of this
this makes me want to continue making this educational content
and if you are an experienced trader and you are looking for trading, if you use my link down below, you do get the best bonus available, which is up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus
you deposit a thousand dollars, you're getting seventy dollars
you deposit 10 000, you're getting 700 on top of that to trade with, which is absolutely phenomenal
i've got full tutorials on how to use these platforms down below, guys
good thing about primix bt, you got four cryptos to use as collateral, bitcoin, ethereum, usdt or usdc, stable coins
okay? you've got forex, you got oil, you got gold, you got s p 500
you know, you got, you can even trade ebec 35, which is the spanish stock market
but anyway, you can trade the s p 500, you know, dax 30, um, natural gas
i use this platform to sometimes trade other markets and accumulate as much bitcoin as i can
guys, this is an accumulation period that we are in right now
this year, next year, will bitcoin go down to twenty thousand dollars? will it go down to ten thousand dollars? hey, bring it on, because i'm gonna buy a few bitcoin at those levels, no doubt about that
millionaires are made in the bear market, not in the bull market
did you enter crypto in 2021, 2022? and, um, like, you know, like i said in in the the last time i i asked this to the community, most it was about 60 of the people entered crypto in 2021 and 2022
let me know, guys in the comment in the poll right now that i just asked, and i'll go through the bitcoin dominance and what i think could happen right now in the bitcoin dominance, where we might find great opportunities on all coins in the next coming months
because the bitcoin dominance is very likely to go up to 50 and even 55 percent after this break out of this resistance
and, uh, in the poll, uh, i've only got, you know, 37 votes, 68 of people say yes, they got into, 21, into crypto in 2021, 2022
you entered crypto right over here when it was, you know, it was absolutely buzzing
we have a bunch of meme coins, a bunch of, of, you know, huge amount of of of projects right over here
you entered crypto, you know, right here at the big, massive hype, just after the big, massive hype
and this over here, this bear market situation is, is this, this range over here, wherever we go
if we manage to go down to sixteen thousand dollars, yeah, bring it on
we're gonna have a black swan event, maybe taking the price, you know, to twelve thousand dollars
you know, um, please do if that does happen, why not? i will be happy enough to put a bunch of stable coins in bitcoin
i think it's very unlikely that we're going to go down to 12 000 or even 16 000
the amount of people that want to buy bitcoin at those levels is huge
how many people want to buy bitcoin at ten thousand, even twenty thousand? huge amount
what is very likely going to happen? yeah, we're not going to reach them, because most of the people want to buy up at these levels, um
the people that stay in crypto in between this year and next year, they're going to be making absolute bank in 2025, 2026
okay, so it is the moment to accumulate, to learn trading, if you wish, of course
but i learned a lot, i read a lot of books, uh, you know, i i understood that, you know, bitcoin is here to stay, of course, and started accumulating big time for a long, long time, for, you know, 20, 20, 18, 2018, 2019, 2020
bitcoins are not going anywhere ethereum's not going anywhere
there you need to er, yeah, bear markets are to be excited and not sad
i'm just going to give you my quick opinion on the bitcoin dominance, what i could what i do think could potentially happen, uh, for the bitcoin dominance, meaning, you know, it is right now at 46 percent, meaning that 40 percent, 46 of the entire crypto market capitalization is on bitcoin
if the entire crypto market cap, i don't know what it is, right now, it should be around about a trillion or so
um, that this means that half of that is on bitcoin, which is, you know, 584 billion
it's just over, it must be over 1 trillion then, uh, the total crypto market cap
people lose interest in all coins, gain more interest in bitcoin, uh, because it's the strongest cryptocurrency
and what has happened right over here, on, on, on, on the bitcoin dominance is that we have lost this lower high range
there is a possibility that we might correct here slightly on the bitcoin dominance and get a big bounce from this last higher high, which is this one at the 44 getting level, bounce from these lower highs
potentially it only, we might even consolidate at this range and continue up
but if that does happen, we are going to see a pretty nice relief rally on all coins, if bitcoin does maintain bullish
and, um, that will be the moment um to to potentially short all coins, because i do see, um, that big bounce here from this level
so potential continuation, uh, to the upside on a bitcoin dominance
you know, textbook, technical analysis target from this descending triangle pattern
and this is a, you know, um or over a year, descending triangle
and from that breakout, you are looking for that potential big, measured move which would take us to the 54, 55 fibonacci retracement
and, you know, it's, it's going to this con big consolidation level
also, from the this major drop, from this drop over here, you will be hitting that, round about that 50 fibonacci
so around this zone, in my opinion, of course, that will be, that will take months
this will be in the next coming months, will be when the when the altcoins will bottom out
most of, most of the altcoins, the good projects, will bottom out, um, at this level
so it's not guaranteed, of course, but i do see the next coming months, bitcoin dominance trying to reach that 54 55 range, approximately, which will be a very good opportunity to get into all coins
okay, a lot of the altcoins are down more than 80 and even 90 and even 95 percent
so it's starting to be a good level, uh, area to to accumulate
what's going on with solana? solana is at a very, very good range
why is it at a good range? we had a large consolidation in april all the way till august
okay, so yeah, over over four months of large consolidation and a little bit of retracement back in 2021 from this area
so in my personal opinion, this over here will be a large, large level to buy up on solana
bear market lows on solana would be around about that 20 19 level
potentially, you might slightly dip below this range, but it's going to be a a potential large consolidation
first of all, we could get that dead cat bounce scenario on solana, just by looking at this chart
uh? why i think this is going to be an accumulation zone is because it has been, you know, there's a large spike on the vpvr
the biggest volume traded from 2021 and 2022 is right over here at 44, exactly at 44 range, 4344
we are getting our consolidation at this range because of this big, large consolidation
um, potential bounce is very, very possible all the way up to 80
i mean, look how we did get and this is that on the threeday chart, in august of 2021, we got a resistance level, consolidation right there
this level was was, um, yeah, we did get that reaction, basically back in january and march here
if the price of solana is going to create this double bottom scenario, only a bitcoin of course, does behave and comes all the way up to 80, i think it's very possible
it's going to be the correction phase, potentially in the coming weeks
this is going to be an insane level for downtrend continuation
and i think this is very likely to happen in the next coming weeks
um 382 50 fibonacci, getting those potential wicks and getting that reaction, if we start creating that price action here at the 80 level on solana, it's going to be an insane shorting opportunity for continuation of this downtrend
on solana, of course, bitcoin starts dropping from this range
yeah, it's this is just going to go sideways, and maybe to the downside, but i don't care
of course, all depending on bitcoin, but we could see this price action on solana
uh, stay super, super cautious on this major resistance level, because you could get heavily rejected
you could get a rejection here, come back down, you could consolidate and finally break up
what could happen here on solana also is, yeah, i, i, i mean, i would be bullish here
why? because you are creating a kind of an adam and eve situation
i think there's a such a high probability, there's such a high probability on on on solana to create an adam and eve right now and retest the 60 range
we're looking for that adam and eve situation where you do have a big spike, you come back up to retest this resistance area at 60 dollars
and now you're just gonna have a large round formation until you come back up and retest the 60 will this level break? we don't know
but the probabilities in getting this the bottom and coming back up and retesting the 60 range, i think there's a slightly higher probability than actually rolling down from this level
of course, what could happen, of course what could happen here is you roll down from this range, and then you roll back up
and, yeah, this would, this will still be an adam and eve pattern
i don't see it successfully breaking down 35 cents low just yet
so if bitcoin doesn't behave in the immediate short term, you know, this is the kind of scenario that you're looking for on solana, and then that will be a, you know, breakout point
but i do see this adam and eve padding potentially playing out on solana
um if it does manage to break this resistance at 60 cent level, you know, the projected move from a double bottom scenario would be coming up to the 80 cent level
and that 80 cent level is just the level that we've been talking about where we should be getting heavily rejected, hitting 382, 50 fibonacci
from the last five, six months traded, that would be the ideal short position on solana, 80 range
so you could see that double bottom scenario here happening on solana
remember, on buy bit, remember on prime xbt, you got the end most insane bonuses that they are available
and also, on buybit, you get four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus, depending on what deposit
and yet, later guys, i will be doing another video update, or a potential live stream, to see what could happen
we've got some technical analysis ideas, of course, also posted every single day
smash up the like button on your way out, and i'll see you guys in the next one
remember the video that i spoke about yesterday? we saw the market breaking the levels
but in today's episode, what i will go through is why it's so important to look at the four hour fibonacci, the daily fibonacci, and to see where the next potential lower high can be
because we still have to follow market structure, and the market is still going down
and until we are waiting for the market to have a big momentum to the upside, there's so many different levels that we need to break
i will show you why i do believe that we can come to these levels, and show you exactly what we look for
don't want to miss this out remember, i am no financial advisor
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly what i see on bitcoin right now
i'm just gonna go through exactly what we did speak about in today's morning live stream, if you missed that one
on the weekly chart, you can see that we did close above the previous low
so what we can do is that we connect the box to the wicks right here with the low of this width that we did have on 22nd of june, back this is where you saw the market holding its support the whole time
you can also see that these two candlesticks that we did have on 27th of may and 28th of may, this was where we tried to break the level, but you could see that the market gave us the fake out
so i'm gonna just try to do this so you understand what i talk about
so when it comes to the fake outs, this is how it looks right? so you see these two candles, they combine with each other
you saw this huge candlestick closing inside of the wrist of the support again, even if this is something that we didn't know what's supposed to happen
but the the only thing that i want to show you is how the fake house looks when they come to a previous support
and this is how it looks when you come back up to your previous resistance, is that you try to break it, the next candlestick is closing inside of the resistance again
but now, if we're gonna look at what happened here on the daily or on on the support that we do have, around twenty eight thousand nine hundred
so we did have the fake out from these uh, from the support, right? and you saw the market break inside of the break below
we closed exactly above the support channel at the support line
so this was something that i did talk about yesterday, because when you see the market coming to a support looking like this, we can expect the market eventually, when we have to, we have to see the market having a pullback
because as long as we are below this resistance trend line, we are technically still in a downtrend
but if we go down to the lower time frames, because what we expect the market to do now, because we want to see where the market can potentially create the lower highs, first target that i will have it from is the 34 740, back down to the support at 27 675
so the first that i'm gonna look at to see if the market give us the lower high could be around thirty one thousand two hundred and thirty
from these levels, we will see the market react in one way or another
but if we see the market creating a lower high on the lower time frames, what you will see is the same thing over and over again
on the lower time frames, you will see the break of structure
so what the market will give you is a high, high, high, low, high, high, high, low
and then you slowly, instead start to see the market break to the downside
we see the market, where, where is the last higher low? where do we break it? is it a fake out that we break the market from the support streamline? because the support trendline is really important, as long as we follow where the price is
the most important thing is that, do we see a break and then see the market push inside again and continuation? because fake outs are everywhere
so that is why it's really important that when, if, if, or when we come inside these fibonacci levels, that's when we we need to, we need to take away our emotions and actually start to see the market for what it is
but okay, so these are the four, this is the four hourly fibonacci
if we want to, if we would potentially now see a bigger fibonacci, what we're going to do is that we're going to draw from the high that would you have at 39 680, to the low at 28 544
that gives us other fibonacci levels at 34 182 and potentially 35 437
and this is exactly the same thing i look at these levels is to see, if we push up to those levels, if we break the four hourly fibonacci and we create the more and the market creates higher highs and higher lows
and we come inside to to these fibonacci levels, this is where i expect the exact same thing
market comes inside, creates high highs and higher lows, and slowly and steady, on the lower time frames, you will start to see the break of structure
if we break that level, if we see, if we see more momentum, we just might come back up to the resistance trendline again, that on the weekly chart is telling us that we are still in a downtrend
so we can definitely come back up and retest the resistance trend line one more time and then see the drop, or potentially see the market break, retest and then see the continuation
but i definitely believe that we will have a push to the upside now
but the only thing that i want people to understand, even though i am no financial advisor, is that just because we see the market giving you a bigger pullback to the upside, that doesn't mean the whole trend will change
the first thing that we will do is to look at these levels that i just showed you, fibonacci levels
if we just look at the with the weekly we also have a super strong previous support that we also can come back up and retest
market could potentially come back down to the support again around 29 124, etc
so these are the first levels that i see the market, uh, before i am even considering telling you that we are in the uptrend
we are definitely in a option if we go down to the lower time frames
but it's always, as i always say, it's always the higher time frames that is telling us what direction we we're in
remember when i said it's so important for us to make sure that we understand what type of market we're in
right now, what we're looking at on bitcoin, we are in a pullback
and then eventually, now if we see that the pullback is done, that's when the impulsive moves happens
and a lot of people, just because they saw the market being bullish, they think that everything will change
but what they don't understand is that what happens, what could potentially happen now, happened here too
the market needed to create a bigger pullback, and then you saw the drop
so a lot of people were thinking, yeah, the market is going up
now what happened? no, market only created the lower high for then create the lower low
and following market structure, the next lower high need to be created for the market to then create the next lower low, or potentially low
and then slowly, instead of break to the upside, because before the market is changing direction, you should always see the market giving two touches of one support
same thing here we have this huge drop, market came back down
a couple of weeks we were bouncing against the support, break to the upside
potentially can create the lower high, comes back down, if we hold ourselves above the previous support

and this is how you are supporting the consensus in me by doing that
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
because in a couple of hours i will go in the new york session live stream
i also have morning live streams every single day, monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time, so one hour before london session
so we go through the setups through the whole day, look at the levels to see what the market is doing against them
during this week, i will also have two live streams where i do back testing together with you
i just let you look at what i do on the charts, and just to study with me
because i definitely, i really want to help you guys to see the charts in an easier way
and i just want to take my experiences and just show that to you
i'm just gonna give everyone the content this morning, monday morning, market has already had some big momentum since yesterday
um, so just one second before i see what everyone is writing, if there's anyone even writing in the chat
how guys, if you haven't already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that before we are going into the charts
how are you? oh, keo, i don't even know what that means, but something from friends
what we can do is that we go into forex factory first of all, because i want to see how this week look
um, so it is monday today, bank holiday usd what it is, why? i haven't even looked that up yet, but maybe you guys know from america what that means
you know, it's, we're a little bit confused here in sweden, because we don't have that, obviously
do we have any red? okay, so on wednesday, uh, a lot of big events for you
on wednesday we have, it looks like we, we have a lot of things that will come out
so, i mean, if you, if you're not used to trade, uh, when it comes to to the news, i would stay outside
i don't, i don't trade the market if i'm not in a very good position already, of far away from the price
because when the market is, when, when you have, uh, those types of news, the market is very volatile
and that's why it's so easy to lose money in the market like that
so, um, just have in mind that on wednesday, it will be a lot of, uh, movements
at least thursday, how does it look? you have every all this the whole week
we have a lot of things going on on usd so expect the market to be, expect the market to, you know, be fun
and, okay, so what we can see since before, uh, i already, i still have
okay, so then i do believe that we will have more momentum um to the downside when it comes to dxi
um, but that is only because the overall picture, we are still in the option, but the market needs to correct itself
so the higher low we are inside, we are slightly below the fifty percent, at one hundred, one point five hundred
i i strongly believe that we will have, i don't think that we will reverse back up right now
based on how the weekly 2 candlestick is looking, it definitely feels like we will have the, i think dxi can come back down to 99799400, because that is also the previous, i think this is the monthly, yeah, exactly
we had a breakout candle that broke the previous resistance, and now we have a kind of a bigger volatility to the downside
so we have one new monthly candle that opens in one day, in 17 hours
and that is very important for us to to understand, because when a monthly candlestick is closing, it's really important, because that's obviously the one that, you know, guide us to where we are going
so, yeah, everything depends on how this candlestick is closing
we just might see the market potentially pull back up to 102600, and then see market come back down to potentially 994 or 500, that i spoke about
but i definitely believe that usd if we're not obviously, the based on the news that we have
i don't know what's gonna happen, but i still believe that we need to pull back down to create the higher low, and then slowly, instead of, uh, continue to the upside, if we're just following what the market is telling us
so the very, the very most important thing is how to read candlestick, because candlestick is like letters
so if beat this, oh, if the xi pulls back down, yeah, i do believe that we will have a green week on on bitcoin
but that is only in in this moment, is because we need to correct the market need to correct itself
so, um, i mean, just because we see the movements to the upside, that doesn't mean the whole trend will break
i'm not gonna say no, because everything can obviously happen
and but what we can try to do is just just to understand to potentially where the market can come to
um, and the previous support that we did break was around thirty six thousand two hundred, right? and usually what happens, as you guys know, the basic of trading, it a previous report becomes, what a new resistance
because after the the downturn that we we've been having for many, many weeks, even if we would see the market, and i've been talking about this five billion times, but i think it's very important to repeat and repeat it to ourselves, is that, um, [Music]
okay, so i but i def yeah, so i expect a pullback, a bigger pull back to upside
but but when we come to potentially 36 200 and even 40 300, this could be where the market actually is reversing back down again
after a huge moment like this, before the market either choose to, uh, continue down or to continue up, the market is usually consolidating
and if that is happening on the higher time frames, we need to be very patient with that
i took the fibonacci on bitcoin now, from 46 890 back to the lower 29 300
and if we go down to the lower time frames, you can see that we are actually in the beginning of a uptrend
we can obviously also see the market coming back up and retest other fibonacci levels
so we're just trying to puzzle everything together, right? um
okay, so the first fibonacci levels that i that i need to look at before we're reaching these levels, because there's so many different things that can obviously happen
and the first target that i that i will look for a potential lower high will be around 31 193 and 32, 32 052, if we want, uh, 32 030, because these are the higher lows based on the last lower high with the lower low
so we just might pull back up to these levels and then see the reverse back down
if the market will not respect these fibonacci levels, we just might push up to potentially thirty four thousand one hundred, or thirty five thousand four hundred, if the market continues up
that's when we start to look at, okay, we're looking at the previous support that we did break, and that is between thirty six thousand one hundred and thirty seven thousand six hundred and ninety
if we break these levels, okay, we need to look at thirty eight thousand and potentially four thousand and one hundred and fifty
so this is, this is something that i, i've also noticed with when i use, when i have these different levels, because we know by now exactly how it looks when the market is reversing, right? so if the market is re retesting these levels, it will show us if this will be the lower high or not
i don't know if you saw my video that i put up yesterday on my youtube channel
so i, i don't remember exactly, i know that i was looking at the lower time frames, but i, i bought the market from these fibonacci levels
that is actually one of the rules that i've been, uh, you know, because i've been questioning myself sometimes
i've been have a little bit trouble when it comes to take profits
so i'm strictly with only taking the fibonacci levels based on the 15 61 that i take um
so say, for example, that okay, we come back up to these levels, and then you see the reverse, i will only have my take profit at the 20 minus 20, 023
because it could be too far away to have my fibonacci levels down here, because the market just not, might come to these levels
the the fibonacci levels on the higher time frames is really good for entries
but then, you i obviously also have to look to potentially, where can we come to when it comes to the lower time frames
fibonacci is easier for me to take, to take profits, because you can see how, because i, i think a lot of people does have problems with take profits
and that is definitely one of the the biggest issue that i've had with myself, too
and one of the things also, now, that is very usual, like, okay, so say, for example, that i take these three take profits, and the take profit goes in
you can only grow your account when you take profits get hit, right? but then sometimes, you know, you can be like, oh, no god, i would have taken, uh, further away, because that is usually what i do
that is, i, i'm only talking for myself now, but i think a lot of people can re relate to that
so i'm very happy when i take my take profits, the target gets hit, and then i just look for new entries um, and if we find another, let's see
it's really hard when the market is just, market is just continuing up
i i wouldn't have bought the market at all at these levels, because you don't know if the market actually comes back down, potentially, maybe retest one of the supports that we have here
and so this was not a good looking chart for me to even go into a trade
um, you would wish we should have bought the market around these levels where i bought the the market too, because if you buy the market now, you will probably see the market pull back down
um, so that is why it's really important to be patient, right? it's really important to be patient
but one of the things that we can do is that we drag a an alert, sorry, crossing up
um, i will go into the chart and look at it, but let's see how it looks
um, we can do it like this, in case we see something happening to the downside, if we only have a quick pullback, we can also put a crossing down
so if the market reaches potentially 30, 310, trading view will give me a notification, and i just might find another buy opportunity
um, so that is what i see right now on ethereum, hello everyone, and welcome
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that
i i will have three updates, three to four updates every single day from monday to friday
this time i will go through the charts together with you and just show you the overall uh of what we see over the day, which i think is really important, and you guys already know that
and i will also have one regular video, because there are some people that don't want to look at the live streams
and tuesday and thursday, i will have backs, a back testing session
if you go go into my youtube channel and scroll down, you can see back test with me
so i've had some, um sessions where i've been back testing together with you
i do really hope that you enjoy these ones, because i think it's really important to show you how i've accessed because this has helped me so much
the back testing is the thing that brought me to where i am today
um, so i will have two sessions, maybe more than two, but definitely on thursday and on tuesday and thursday
so let's see, what time is that? um, i will have it during the night swedish time
so say, for example, like, okay, from this time wherever you are fifth
like okay, so 14 hours from this time, i will have my back testing sessions
i don't i'm so bad at when it comes to the to the clock, when it comes to other countries
okay, so just so you know, so if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, do that, um, because we go through technical analysis
and don't forget that to support me and bitcoin census, you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
it is super great, because if we want to hold our positions for a long time, it's, it's based on the fees
but now, when i see exactly, um, when i see exactly what i um, you can see exactly what you are willing to lose and what you're willing to gain
and that's what i love with with bibit also, it helps me so much
even though, if you need to calculate yourself, but i really do enjoy it having on, uh, on the same platform that i train
tracy, how are ya? how are you? tracy jack um, okay, so we're gonna go into ethereum
so, since yesterday i didn't take this trade on on ethereum, can you see how perfectly the market came back down to these fibonacci levels? so this was based on, on the video
so if you saw the video yesterday, if you saw the video yesterday, you would, even though i'm no financial advisor, but this trade was so good
can you see, like, from from the entry to take profit one, take profit two
and we are right now reaching, and we are right now reaching the previous support that we also did break right? so beautiful
and we came back down exactly and filled with now, like, i just want you to remind, uh, remember this when you see, when you see huge wick like this, trust me when i say the market will always fill them, like always, at least 50 percent, or ha, or the whole one
so either the market will fill the week, fifty percent of the week, as you can see, or the whole week
if we just drag, so i'm dragging the fibonacci to calculate the market filled this week 50
so if we just go back, can you see this week too? when you see volatile, big weeks like this
we're coming back up to retest the previous support that we did break at 1 900
okay? and looking at the lower time frames, this is we could definitely see the market come back up to these levels and then potentially see a reverse
what we're going to do is that we will drag a fib from 2066 back down to 1000, uh, 1720
and you can see that the fibonacci, we are breaking the 50 at 1895
so this is where we we will look at the market if we see the reverse back down
that is why it's so important that we look at how the candlestick is looking, right? so the higher time frames, we have such huge volatility
but we need, the market needs to, needs to pull back, right? so what we're gonna do, even if we see the market having like this huge option, i'm still going to use the trend line in case we see the market break it
we can go down to the 15 minutes chart also, so we can have different trend lines
so something like this, even if the market would break it, i'm obviously not gonna sell the market, because you can definitely see the market come back down for a higher low and then see the continuation
but that is i i put the alert on to it, just because if the, if i can't, if i forget it? um, um, yeah, if i've, yeah, so if i forget it, the market will notif, uh, give me the notification
so if we break the last higher low, i just might change my minds and be like, okay, maybe now i need to sell the market
but everything depends on how the market is looking right? and then i also go back to the xi to see it does the does it actually look like we're reversing to the upside right now? um, so yeah, this is what i look at
you can see how the market is retesting the the end of the support that we did retest, even if the market will break to it
and that is why it's so important for for us to use the technical tools in the right way
and that is why you should be on my back session live streams and my videos
because what i go through, i just show you exactly what i see on the charts
and this was also something that i wanted to tell you, like everyone that's on this live stream, if you are choosing, if you choose to want to become a trader, i swear to god that you will be a trader
you you make it to your own thing with all of the other things that you already know, right? so i'm just here to help you
okay? i would love natalie so much, because there's so many good things that i show you that no one else does
so if you want to take it serious, you take this channel serious
we're just waiting for the market to pull back up to these levels
if we see the market having more momentum, the second target that i can see ethereum coming back up to is 2030
but remember, it's a long time before the market comes to this level
so that is why we always need to focus on what's happening here, right? i love you too, guys
okay, we can go to use 30, because this is one of the pairs that i trade market
so this is one of the examples where the market did not, where the market did not, uh, respect the fibonacci levels, right? so i, i had a fibonacci level on us third and now, 32 340 and 32 960
this is why it's so important to look at the lower time frame, since it was actually happening
because, as you guys know, when i want to sell the market, we need to break the previous higher low for us to create a lower low, come back up, create the lower high, and then see the break
this is why it's also so important, it's also so important to to follow the rules and just not jump into it just because, oh, because this is something that i, i did wrong, uh, before
what i what i've learned, right? so, um, you see, the market created a high, market came back up and created a lower high, because we closed below the first one
and now, you know, this is how i would think before, right? so okay, we create the lower, a high
now we do have this inverted hammer, or hanging man, or the market did fill it
but if i would have sold the market here, which i would have done before, because i was that stupid, i would have sold the market from this level, because i think the market will break it
so in my head, i'm like, okay, you know what? let's sell the market from this level so i have a better price, and then i sell the market one more time, if the market does this
but the market have never given me any confirmation that it's actually on its way down
and based on that, i think that, yeah, but we are in the higher time frames, fibonacci levels
and so that is why i do believe the market will reverse back down
but then you see what? market goes up, and you lose your money because you're stupid
i was stupid because i didn't wait for the market to give me the exact, uh, confirmations
so don't be stupid like me, because you will lose so much money
but you at one point you don't want to continue to lose money
you want to earn money, not continue doing the same stupid mistakes that we do over and over again
go ahead and like the live stream, okay? but we don't want to do the same stupid things over and over and over again
but 146 on this live stream, i swear to god, if you haven't already figured out, you're stuck in the same thing, is that you you're choosing trades that you know you should not trade, just because you're greedy
okay, looking at us 30, after this little speech that i do have sometimes here and then
but i think it's really important, because no one's talking about the fundamentals in that way and how much it can destroy you from the inside
okay, take this serious and change your life, because that's why you're here, you want to change your life
okay, i'm gonna, i'm gonna stop talking now and show you what i see
okay, so looking at us 30, we came back down to a support that we did break inside again at 32 890, if we go back to the lower time frames
so i also took a fibonacci from the last lower high that we do have at 34 858, back down to the lower low at 32 000, to 31 295
and we did break above the support, tren uh, the support and so now we can go down to the lower time frames
we also had a great retest of it, since yesterday we almost came back down and retested it fifty percent
so what we do? i always hit the like button when the live ends
my computer, i, i do have some trouble with my, my, my charger
so i'm gonna wait for the market now, on on uh us 30, to break this level at 33 500, because that is the 50 percent crossing up or 61, is it? the 618? yeah
so even if, even if i buy the market, i need, i need the us30 to pull back down a little bit, um, but i could, if i see the market pull back up to the to the 618 percent
um, what exchange do you trade on the noncrypto market? uh, prime xpt is one of the one, the one that i use
um, because you can trade use 30 and xbox 500 on on that one too
is more of a day trading platform, because the fees is really high
but you can also receive a bonus on prime expertise through bitcoin census
and you also have the link in this, uh, link in the description down below
so the first thing that i will do is that i take fibonacci on the daily chart, from seventy dollars back down to, uh, fifty six dollars
and you can see that we are right now pulling back up to these levels, and those are at 632 and also 648 dollars
go down to the lower time frames, we can also, i mean, we could also see on the higher time frames, but this is a previous support that we did break
so remember that if we come to previous support to create a lower high, usually what happens is that the lower high is against the previous support that we did break
but definitely look at these levels, first of all, to see if we potentially can see the pull back down
it doesn't mean that we will pull back down forever, but we can at least come back down to the support again
if we break the support, you will see that you break the support, retest continuation
now, it will not happen at the moment, but just because i know that, okay, but if the market comes to these levels, where should i have my take profit, even though i'm no financial advisor
we just might see the market, you know, consolidating between these levels until it actually decides to what direction it will go to
i would just wait for the market to, i mean, you can see on the lower time frames, of course, you see the market create lower lows, lower highs
but, um, i would definitely look at the higher time frames, fibonacci, to see the real move to the downside
so if we come up, and then you start to see the reverse back down, this will be the impulsive move, the right move, because the market, it's the market is in a downtrend
we have been looking and we did look at ethereum, and bitcoin and us
so the first level that i look at now, um, or not the first level
just so we are sure that we're not, that we don't miss the trade um
okay, so first level, even if we have a huge momentum, now, this is only because we want to see what's actually going to happen
yeah, my, my, my laptop is really slow because the charger, is something wrong with the charger
and i actually read it yesterday that it can be the charger, because when the charger inside the the computers get slow
okay, so first level that i look at is five point one hundred and seventy two and five point three hundred and sixty five
from these levels we could see the market pull back down, but it looks like we do have a bigger momentum, so it doesn't feel like we can
if we have a bigger pullback, we can come up to 5767 and potentially 677
this is where we could potentially expect the market to reverse back down
i also connected the dots with the trend, uh, this high with this lower high, which means that if we pull back up and retest this previous resistance
also, we even if the market is pushing to the upside, you will definitely see the market having have a pullback to the downside either way
but this is where i first of all look at when it comes to gal
so, gal, i'm trying to be fast now, because my computer is so annoying, and i want to try to give everyone what you what you want
can you see? i did expect the market to pull back down to 911 and 941
can you see how beautiful the market came back down to these fibonacci levels and just retested it and then broke to the upside
can you this is why you should subscribe to my channel, if you haven't already done that, and look at my back testing live streams and look at my videos
huh? okay, so we came back down to the fibonacci levels where we tested it
so 118 and 127 is where i potentially can see aave now pull back up to
and this is combined with where we could potentially see the market reverse back down on the bot
okay, so looking at solana, we did break, uh, we did close, uh, last week below 4747
and that is the previous, that is the previous, uh, resistance that we did have
this is why it's really important that we use previous support and resistance zones
so now the same thing that we will do is that we drag fib from 5884 back down to 4111
i'm gonna take this box away, that gives us fibonacci levels 4993 and 5211
if that is the case, take profit one will be 3686, and take profit two will be 2760
but that is only if you see the market reverse back down from these levels, right? this is on the daily chart
because as long as we are above this, uh, this trend right now, we could still create higher highs and low and higher lows to these levels
can you see how per even if the market will continue back up, but we are retesting the 618 percent so perfectly now on the lower time frames
but remember what i say, the market needs to create, the market needs to break the previous higher low
when we come inside the fibonacci levels, the market needs to break the previous higher low, in this case, that is 4570, to create a lower low, come back up and retest um or create the lower high
and i will find that with the fibonacci when the pro if the prices give me these levels, the fibonacci will calculate where the the the lower high price can be
i just still need to wait for the market to do whatever, because you just might also see mark pull back down to these levels
don't care about these fibonacci levels at all, even if you're retest
do you enjoy this morning livestream? guys, welcome to the channel
i've been doing this since 2018, and i'm sitting here on youtube just because i want to share everything that i know myself with you, because i know how hard it can be
and if you want to be part of my bitcoin census community with me, i will give you the link to that
because on this community we talk about, uh, we talk about trades all the time
but if you want to be part of a community that talks about cryptocurrencies every single day, and you can have direct contact with me also, you are more than welcome
so if you are not already in the chat, you are, as i told you, you are more the welcome
they just, some people actually find each other in each other countries, and we're like, what are you also trading? so people find each other in the chat
so this is also some something that i do really love, is that we can connect with each other from different parts of the world
for beginners, i'm very good when it comes to the technical very good
so if you want to understand more how i do it, go to market structure, part one and part two, and just practice this
this is how i can calculate where the market is, uh, where it's going, based on so many different things
and remember that i also have this back testing, back test with me
you cannot be good at something if you don't, if you don't practice it
and don't, don't say stupid things to yourself like, oh, i wish i can do this and that
you every other trader has been doing the same thing, so you also need to do that
practice, practice, practice, and trust me when i say like, trust me when i say you will become a good trader
how are you feeling this morning? here's your coffee with oatmeal
i'm so hyped, because this week i'm gonna go 100 and just show you everything that i see
hit the notification so you know when i am live, when i do have my daily updates
you can also receive a bonus on bobbitt of the four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this is how you are supporting me and bitcoin census by doing that
if you are a swing trader, definitely, and you want to hold your position for a long time with a very low fee
i have social media, so i'm gonna go and i'm gonna how, i'm gonna give some content to twitter right now
we also have instagram, facebook, and we also have a, uh, we also have a website where we have daily updates about cryptocurrencies every single day
so you can go in here and just read about what interest, what is interested for you
and you have so many different categories you can go into, right? so i want to say thank you for everyone that took their time
remember that we will have these morning livestreams every single day from monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time, one hour before london sessions
they go up in the middle of the night to look at these live streams
and the good thing is that, i mean, you you prioritize yourself
maybe it sucks, but trust me, will be beneficial for you in the future
and don't forget that we will also have back testing sessions, uh, tuesday and thursday together, also a live stream
so i'm gonna turn off the chat at that moment so we can only focus on the charts
you have the chat to the telegram where we talk about cryptocurrencies
this is my beautiful little community that we do have on bitcoin census, where you have direct contact with me and all the other beautiful people
right? okay, so i'm gonna end it now, for the second million times
i say this all the time, and we're gonna end this now, but i never end it
if you did like this live stream, i will support myself by doing that
my name is josh, and over the past 24 hours, the price of bitcoin has broken out of this descending triangle pattern, which is following along this fractal very closely
but we still have some other levels of resistance to pay attention to for bitcoin before continuing with further upside price targets
and also, ethereum is making an attempt to push above this level of resistance, which i'll be talking more about later in this video
so definitely stick around now, just starting off on the weekly bitcoin charts, because we've just seen a weekly candle close, confirming the ninth red week in a row
we have now confirmed nine consecutive red weekly candles, which is a brand new record
seriously, throughout the last 13 plus years worth of bitcoins history, we have never seen nine red weekly candles in a row until now
and if you understand probabilities, with every red weekly candle, it becomes more and more likely that we're eventually going to see another green weekly candle next time around
and so the fact that we've now seen nine consecutive red weekly candles, it is very likely we're gonna have a green weekly candle very soon
but of course, there's still another six days to go until we close this week's candle, so only time will tell
and now looking on the daily bitcoin charts, looking at this fractal i've been talking about over the past few days
as of right now, this fractal is pretty much perfectly playing out
basically, we're playing out very similar price action to what we saw in the middle of last year
because obviously, during the middle of last year, we had the massive bitcoin crash during may last year, and then we had a lot of sideways consolidation leading into a shortterm pump, and then some more sideways consolidation, which we actually sweeped the original lows a couple more times before then we bottomed out and began a bullish reversal
and so just keep that in mind, even though we're seeing some short term bullish price action right now, it's definitely possible we could come back down towards these slightly lower levels, at around 28 and a half thousand, for example, and possibly even back towards 25k
but with that being said, i'm certainly not betting everything on seeing those lower prices
and that time where we did get down towards 25k, as i mentioned publicly on the channel before that happened, i said that i'll be entering heavier into bitcoin at around 25k as a price target
and so in my personal situation, having already accumulated a bunch of bitcoin at around 25 to 26 thousands, obviously it would be great to see bitcoin enter an immediate bullish reversal
and realistically speaking, it's unlikely we're going to see an immediate bullish reversal
we're probably going to chop around for a little bit longer before we see any further bullish reversal, perhaps later on, in another month or two from now
but as i've been discussing quite a lot recently on the channel, this also depends a lot on what the stock market is doing
and so every day the stock market is open, i'll be sure to keep you updated on what's happening there in these videos
and if you're heading out to the twoday bitcoin charts, obviously we still have this bullish divergence, which is active on the chart and playing out right now
and for anyone that might be new to the channel, this just means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, at least in the shorter term
so that either means sideways price action or some shortterm bullish moves
that's pretty much exactly what we've been seeing over the past couple weeks, as expected
but going back to the daily bitcoin chart, looking at the bollinger bands indicator, we are still seeing a massive squeeze in this indicator, which tells us an extremely volatile move is coming sometime soon
for example, the last squeeze we saw in this indicator was right back here, towards the beginning of may
and obviously, just around the corner was an extremely volatile move
in fact, this move was roughly around 36 and so being a little bit more conservative with perhaps a 20 volatile move, if that plays out to the upside, that could take us well into the mid 30k price range
but on the flip side, if we confirm a break below support, and that volatile move plays out to the downside, then i'll be targeting towards around 25k, at least, and potentially as low as around 22 to 23 000, as i discussed in yesterday's bitcoin update video
and if you want to know more information about this indicator right here and what i expect bitcoin to do over the next one month or so, definitely check out my last bitcoin update video that i posted yesterday on the channel
and obviously, over the past one day, we've seen a nice breakout out of this descending triangle pattern, which is technically a bearish pattern
because, yes, more often than not, this type of pattern does end up breaking to the downside, but this is one of those more rarer examples where we do actually see a breakup to the upside, which can indeed happen
and so if you measure the technical price target for this breakout to the upside, that puts the bitcoin price at around 32 and a half thousand dollars per bitcoin
which from the point of the breakouts, if you had a conditional order set up there, ready to enter a long position, first of all, you would already be up around three and a half percent with no leverage
but from where we are right now to the technical price target, that is still another six percent move
and just as a side note, my personal trading strategy when it comes to patterns like this, anytime i see a nice breakout and i'm in a long position, i always put my stop loss into profits in case this does end up reversing before we hit the price target
so that way, if my stop loss is above my entry price in a long position, that means, the worst case scenario, i'm still making some sort of profits
i'm just telling you my personal strategy when it comes to trading moves like this
and something else that we also have to keep in mind is the fact that we still have other points of resistance along the way
for example, right around here, at around 307 k, we have been finding some shortterm resistance at around this price level over the past half a day, approximately
but if we see a confirmed breakouts above that level, with perhaps a four hour candle close, or preferably a daily candle close, then i'll be looking towards this high just here as the next possible shortterm point of resistance, coming in at around 314k approximately
and anything above that, i'll be looking towards this technical price target at around 32 and a half thousand
and something very interesting about the threeday bitcoin chart is the threeday bitcoin rsi forming a massive falling wedge pattern, which i have discussed in past bitcoin update videos
and in bitcoin's past, we have seen a similar pattern to this play out back in 2018, entering into early 2019
and if you look at the final capitulation event at the end of the 2018 bear markets, both in the price action and in the threeday rso that actually looks very similar to what we've seen in recent months in both the rsi and the price action
and looking at what happened after the bottom of the 2018 bear market, when the threeday bitcoin rsi entered into oversold territories, touching the bottom line of supports for this falling wedge pattern, we ended up seeing a shortterm bounce in the bitcoin price, but eventually played out a few more months without sideways consolidation
basically one giant accumulation range at the end of the bear markets
and then it was the moment we started to see a breakout in the threeday bitcoin rsi above this massive line of resistance
at that point during around february 2019, that was the perfect signal to enter into bitcoin, just before we played out the next extremely bullish move in the bitcoin price
and so that's why i said earlier when i was covering this bitcoin fractal, and also what i was saying yesterday about how the most likely scenario for bitcoin moving forward is potentially more sideways price action in some sort of sideways price range
and then within that sideways price range, of course, we can experience decent swings in the price as well
as you can see that this overlaid price action, which is what we saw in the middle of last year, is very similar to what bitcoin played out at the end of the 2018 bear market
and in order to eventually confirm a proper bullish reversal for bitcoin, ideally we need to see a breakout in the threeday bitcoin rsi above this line of resistance, which is coming into play at around 50 at the moment
and as of right now, at the time recording this video, we're still quite a way off that level
but given enough time, eventually the rsi will reach that level again on the threeday time frame
and eventually we will see a further recovery in the bitcoin price
and now getting into the ethereum part of this video, this right here is the ethereum to yours dollar chance on the daily time frame
and obviously we still have this active bullish divergence playing out right now, which i talked about yesterday and the day before
and as of right now, the overall trend in the daily ethereum rsi is an uptrend, which is good to see, because usually when we see that happen we see more bullish price action
but keep in mind, during march last year, when we experienced that move, at the same time as that playing out for ethereum, we also saw a lot of bullish price action playing out in the stock market
so basically, in order to experience another move like that moving forward, would need to see a lot more bullish price action play out in the stock market
but as of right now, this is still a good signal for ethereum, at least in the shorter term
looking over the next few days or so, i do not expect a major ethereum crash
and if you zoom into the four hour ethereum charts at the time of recording this video, ethereum is making an attempt at breaking above this line of resistance, which is coming into play at around 1900 approximately
we still need to see some more confirmation here, for example, a four hour, or ideally a daily kennel close above 1900
and also, if we could potentially see a retest of that level, flipping it into new support, that would further confirm these breakouts above this level just here
i'll be looking towards this resistance level coming into play at around 2060, approximately
dollar in this type of market will most likely follow what bitcoin is doing against the us
which is why it is important to keep an eye on the ethiopians bitcoin chart to see how ethereum is performing against bitcoin
and as i've been discussing quite a lot recently on the channel, obviously, we're playing out this short term bounce as expected after reaching this line of support in the threeday rsi
because the last three times since this happens for ethereum vs bitcoin in the threeday rsi, we've also played out at least a shortterm bounce for ethereum vs bitcoin
and if you're looking at these two examples in particular, because during those times in the market, we saw a lot of bearish price action in the overall crypto market, whereas this time in late 2021, we saw a lot of bullish price action
so it wouldn't really be fair to compare this to what we're seeing at the moment, and instead compare what we're seeing at the moment to what we saw perhaps early this year or during the middle of last year
and in both of these examples, we saw around three green daily kennels before eventually we rolled back over to the lows
and keep in mind, during this entire stage in the markets, ethereum versus bitcoin was still in a confirmed uptrend
whereas right now, technically speaking, it is in a confirmed downtrend on the threeday time frame, because we have already confirmed a lower high and a lower low
so simply, based on those previous examples, i would expect perhaps one to two weeks worth of a balance from the moment where we started bouncing and then potentially starts rolling back over
and considering the fact that we are technically in a downtrend right now, we are simply more likely to see a continuation in this trend
so overall, i am slightly bullish in the immediate short term for ethereum vs bitcoin, while we are playing out this shortterm bounce
but in the larger multimonth trend, i am obviously more bearish than bullish, because this is clearly a downtrend
and zooming out to the weekly ethereum versus bitcoin charts, i won't go too much into detail about this chart right here, because i did that in my last video on the channel
but basically, if you're looking at the valuations we're sitting at right now, according to historical valuations, we clearly have some more room to the downside
because keep in mind, at the end of the 2018 bear market, right around here, even though ethereum against the us
dollar bottomed out at this stage right here, ethereum against bitcoin still had one more dump to the downside over the next few months before then we bottomed out
and during this stage in the market when ethereum was dumping against bitcoin, once again, both ethereum and bitcoin were pumping against the us
dollar during that stage in the markets, but bitcoin was simply outperforming ethereum, which is why i'm a lot heavier into bitcoin right now compared to my ethereum holdings
i'm not very heavy into ethereum at the moment, even though i am lightly dollar cross averaging
and obviously, over the past one week, if you've been keeping up with my recent videos, you would know that i did move some of my ethereum holdings into bitcoin
to protect myself from more downside price action for ethereum versus bitcoin
and all of this goes hand in hand with the bitcoin dominance chart, which is obviously in a confirmed uptrend on the three day time frame right here
but honestly, nothing much has happened to this chance over the past couple days
so if you want to know more information about this chance right here, which is important for all old screen holders out there, definitely check out my last video that i posted on the channel
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to maximize your profits in crypto, even when prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
today we are going to analyze the situation, see what's going to happen in between today and tomorrow
and we'll be taking a look at some other all coins, if you wish
now, i'm just going to go quickly through, go through the comment section
smash that like button, says mark dutch, absolutely um, guys, yeah
first of all, you need to smash that like button all the way here to 100 likes, at least more than 100 people watching at this moment
guys, uh, we'll be taking a look at bitcoin, of course, on the weekly
i want to take a look at this situation over here, because bitcoin is right now, you know, breaking here from these lower highs
is there a possibility that bitcoin will pump a little bit in the coming hours or coming days? i think this is very possible
friday went from 4 000 points all the way to almost 4 200, slightly below 4200
i made a video on the 23rd of may, talking about this potential shark pattern, this kind of double bottom scenario
okay? when we were training at the 3900 points on the s p 500, looking for that potential leg up, this harmonic pattern
okay? surpassing this b point double bottom, and looking for that 4 200 point area for in the next coming days
and this is exactly what is happening right now on the s p 500, as you can see here, playing out beautifully
we still got a couple of days to actually reach that 4 230 points, approximately
so we finally did break above from this major resistance we talked about, you know, this resistance, getting a little bit of that consolidation, getting that little reaction, finally breaking, okay, potentially monday's maybe going to be a little bit bearish for a correction
but i do see us having that leg up, okay, potentially to the 4230 points
and i think this is why it is very, very possible that bitcoin will be slightly bullish in the short term
okay? this is why i do think that we are maybe going to get that leg up, if the s p 500 is going to continue bullish here on the, you know, the next couple of days
of course, i was looking for that leg up long in here on primex bt, this area over the 3900 points, as you can see i will be taking profits, of course, as soon as we do start hitting, you know, this 4 200 range
and potentially we are going to get that reaction from this level
as soon as we do hit this 4200, 4250, around that range and start consolidating, it is very likely going to get rejected, and we are going to continue back down here on the s p 500
we're going to take a look at, you know, the dxy, also is the dicks
we're going to have a little bit of more bearish trend in the next coming days, because we have broken a major support line
okay, the last higher low here, uh? this this trend line here from the higher lows, as you can see, getting that consolidation finally breaking
are we going to continue down? i would like to know your opinion in the comment section, of course
also, what do i think? what do i see on the charts on bitcoin? mainly i want to focus on bitcoin, get ready for tomorrow
get ready for those levels where we could get rejected, you know, for potential short opportunities, for long opportunities
i want to be ready at these strong levels where the price can bounce or get rejected and take opportunity of the market
um, what is going on with luna? because luna has its new coin
so, yeah, i would stay away from this one, because this is just going down lower and lower
who knows, it might be, you know, it might be good to put a small percentage of your portfolio into the new lunar coin
gmt or gst, because there's two, right? there's a, well, there's a few
let's take a look at green satoshi token on the chart here, right away
they need a lot of people to come in to actually pay the the the old um, all the investors, the old people that are um are using the app, right? so what i can see here on steppen is still in a very aggressive downtrend
you know, this is, there is a possibility that you may be going to create a dual bottom
i think you are probably going to break this low very aggressively, in a downtrend, no signs of stopping anytime soon
let's take a look at gmt here one second, because gmt, um, wow
so we actually, um, did have a really nice call on this descending triangle break down to come down and retest these lows
we've retested the lows, and it's creating this double one scenario
so potentially we are going to see gmt token start pumping a little bit more in the coming days
um, can you take a look at crv? hey, rudy, how are you doing? how are you? how are you? let's take a look at crv right away
i guess this is a really nice d5 project, but it is getting getting absolutely crushed, like most of them
now, this is the question, will the summer lows, like many other cryptos such as bitcoin, will the summer lows of 2021 hold the range? okay? this is one of the strongest levels of support
and you know, there is a possibility that this area is going to hold for immediate, shortterm bounce such as curved token
we can see curved token retesting the lows, getting the consolidation
is this consolidation ready to have that dead cat bounce, to have that relief rally, and then potentially come down, retest it the lows here and break it? i think so
i think a potential bounce if bitcoin does behave, because if we do see bitcoin pumping, you know, to that 30 000, 500, 32 000, i think a lot of the altcoins, such as curved token, will be having that relief rally, of course
and where could that really rally happen? well, we do have a major low support level here for a march on curved token, as you can see
and it would be around about that 50 fibonacci retracement from the actual drop here that we did have from this last lower highs
this is the last lower high over here at 260, before the big, massive drop here that we did have in may
so, fibonacci retracement, i would be looking for that 50 level where we do have big, big, big, strong resistance
if we do climb all the way up here to around about that 180 range, then this is going to be potentially a good shorting opportunity
we'll be following the trend to the downside, just ready to create that next lower high to attempt to break this 12110, 120 area low
this is why i'm focused more on bitcoin and the stock market s p 500, uh, just to see, you know, potentially, if we are going to see that relief rally on some altcoins, of course, such as curved token, very strong support, stronger support level that we do have right now, which is the summer 2021 lows, as you can see here
you are potentially, we are potentially looking for that relief rally
i mean, this is a really, really insane um bullish setup right over here, where you are kind of creating, uh, an inverse head and shoulder with a descending neckline
you know, this is screaming for that, before that relief rally, as you can see, massive, massive lower highs
as soon as you do start breaking here on crv, this major neckline
okay, these kind of lower highs, then, um, yeah, you could see, uh, some potential bullish momentum
if you do see that breakout in the next coming days, then you could see a larger relief rally on on um curved token
this is, this does look like a potential bullish set up right there, where you are going to finally get that relief rally, and then maybe continue to the downside, of course, after this big, aggressive drop, which is consolidating here
um, so, yeah, i wouldn't say that this is a descending triangle, of course, because you do have this one slightly lower low and this higher low over here
it looks pretty good for a potential relief rally in the coming days
if bitcoin does behave, of course, if bitcoin starts dropping, then we are going to see all of these ones, you know, potentially rolling down
we need a successful breakout from the 130 at this moment, to see some pretty good confidence for a larger move to the upside on crv token, of course
if we start getting above the biggest point of control here, which is at the 130 range, okay, on crv, then we could see that momentum
yes, i'm i actually got, um, some family there are, there's, uh, you know, they are strong supporters of liverpool
but anyway, i was born in spain, so, yeah, real madrid is my favorite team, of course
uh, let's take a look at roon right away here for happy looking
let's take a look at, you know, basics, price action, major levels
um, yeah, this is, you know, i do see a potential big bounce to happen on roon from these levels
and you know, this has created a huge, massive descending triangle, okay, where you do have a solid support level
i do see a big relief rally from this range and potentially to create the next lower high in the coming weeks
it's in a big, big, aggressive downtrend right now with the lower highs
big, solid support level, you know, big, uh, descending triangle
we have been bouncing from this range several times in 2021, 2022
so we can potentially see another big bounce on roon from these levels
are we creating a kind of a double bottom scenario right now on roon? very, very possible
very, very possible that we are going to create a double bottom here
we got this one right over here, created on the 12th of may, and now this one the last few days, hitting this 2 3240 low
if stocks behave, if bitcoin behaves, we are looking for big relief rallies on the altcoins
and something interesting to point out here would be taking a look at the bitcoin dominance, because the bitcoin dominance is looking quite bullish
we've seen that break out on the bitcoin dominance from this these lower high trend line, uh, this little high trend line
of course, if we do see that bitcoin dominance get a small correction here to potentially this major resistance, uh, turning into support, then this will have a good effect on on all coins
as soon as this correction finishes, of course, i think that the bitcoin dominance is going to go to higher level in this bearish market situation, then we're gonna see, you know, again, the altcoins bleed against bitcoin
remember, we have been pumping here for the last 10, 15 days on the bitcoin dominance, going from 415 all the way to 46
and that is why all coins have been bleeding a lot, not just against the us
this is why, you know, this is it doesn't usually go up like in a straight line
in this corrective wave, we are, we can see those alt coins, you know, having those small double bottoms, having those relief rallies to the upside, just like i showed you on roon, just like i've showed you on other cryptos also
so short term bullish doesn't mean extremely bullish, we're going to the moon
it means that we are potentially going to see that relief rally, potentially see that bounce
of course, i would be bearish once we see that bullish momentum
trx, also, tron, let's take a look at um avax, see what's going on
we had a big consolidation, uh, on avax, right over here, back in february, all the way till may, big consolidation area, after having a big, massive run up here to that 60 area, alltime high, then came down and consolidated here nicely in between 20 approximately and 35 round this range
as you can see, i think this level could be a consolidation range for avax in the next coming weeks
um, could we break down, of course, and come as low as as three dollars, where we do have a big spike on the vpvr? uh, yeah, i don't think that is going to happen just yet
we've had a very, very aggressive drop already, uh, the last few weeks on avax
uh, like a lot of the cryptos, consolidation, relief rallies before continuing to the downside, i think, is the most likely scenario
now, this doesn't mean okay, because i know everybody is extr a lot of people are extremely bearish guys
we've been going down for a lot, you know, let the price action cool off for a little bit
maybe some relief rallies is very, very likely before continuing down
um, we had some, we had, we did have some things on cartesia here
we had that descending wedge hitting the the the summer lows, managing to get that bounce, but heavily got rejected from this major, big support line
didn't manage to break this high over here, got a rejection, came back down and broke the summer lows of 2021
if we do see that relief rally, for them, some altcoins, and for bitcoin
of course, i do see cartesi coming all the way up here to around about the 37, 30 cent level
that would be the the summer lows and also the lows created here in march
if we do see that relief rally, this level over here, around the 30 cents, 35 cents, is going to be very, very strong resistance
i would be also focusing on important fibonacci levels from this high to the low
i would be loaded looking for that 50 here at 35, to get that potential rejection if it gets really, really crazy
even 38, just a wick here, trying to get above this may major resistance line, but then continuing back down, looking for that 50 fibonacci retracement from this high to the lows
of course, big consolidation, relief rally looks almost imminent after this insane drop now
um, some might think, you know, is this a bear flag? is this a bear pennant? um, i would say no, i would say no
i would say that we are looking for that or that potential, you know, breakout from this range and and a bigger relief rally
uh, obviously looking for bitcoin to behave, stock markets to behave in the next coming days
um, bitcoin is about to make a massive move, says cow analysis
this doesn't mean, uh, you know, as soon as we see bitcoin potentially hitting thirty thousand five hundred um, i'm gonna start becoming bearish at this range
if we do have another leg up here, to thirty two thousand, dollar, thirty 31 800, that is the moment where i am going to be extremely bearish, just because it's such a huge level
i like to be bearish after, after, you know, major pumps hitting big resistance levels
now, of course, on bitcoin, you know, i've got this level marked for a long time already, but the price action has been so, so boring
we either go to the downside and looking for bigger support levels, or to the upside and looking for big resistance levels
um, so and, yeah, the deal is, they want the 3000, the 31 770 range is a big weekly level
we've got a big resistance here that we did create on the 11th and 12th of may here, as you can see, sorry, the 10th and the 11th of may
it's a big, big level where i do see the bitcoin price not managing to break above it, and actually, you know, creating a kind of a double top scenario and breaking back down
i think a lot of people might think, yeah, we're not going to thirty thousand five hundred
should i long? i'm not going to tell you if you're going along
i'm just going to do a little bit of analysis and and talk about the potential, high probability
ethereum is, you know, on the verge of creating that massive, big double bottom
where are we? where are we at? we are at the strongest support level that was created in 2021
let's go to the three daily and we can see here the insane bounces that we did get as support the entire summer of 2021
we i know we could get that double bottom scenario if stocks behave, and bitcoin also
and it's, it's getting that small relief rally at this moment
i do see it going to higher levels, uh, in the next coming days
um, and one of the reasons why, like i said, two reasons why, is s p 500 looking pretty bullish for the moment
uh, i do see a few more days of bullishness, but then i do see a corrective move
so let's see, if, you know, bitcoin and crypto is going to have time the next few days, you know, by next week, to have that bigger relief rally, and then potentially looking for shorting opportunities
i am looking for shorting opportunities if we do see the bitcoin price pumping
uh, while a lot of the people are going to start, you know, uh, calling for crazy levels as soon as we start, you know, pumping, maybe in the coming days
uh, this is, if it does happen, guys, we could roll down from here and and retest the 25 26k levels
one of the main reasons i am a little bit bullish, like i said, is because of the stock market
this is really, you know, that stock market and crypto bitcoin in general are really high, uh, correlated
i'm going to be a little bit bullish in the short term on bitcoin
um, dxy, dxy also, if dxy does continue in this corrective move, breaking this trend line from the higher lows, uh, it's below a major support level, you know, the 100 and 250, as you can see here, getting that rejection already
is it going to manage to continue back down? this would have a good effect on bitcoin, of course
um, uh, let's take a look at ethereum, yeah, like i said, ethereum, you know, double bottom scenario is in play right now
if bitcoin and stocks behave, it's at the strongest level of support, a bigger relief rally
how many likes can we get into the live stream? mark dutch, thank you
i this is one of the pro coin projects that will survive the bear market
i think it's one of them that will have an insane run up in the next hype, the next, you know, cryptocurrency hype
get this out of the way, because the corrective move has been absolutely insane
but just thinking about theta, just a few years ago, was trading at 10 cents
it is already, you know, it's still, uh, you know, 10x in two years
i want to take a look here at what would be the biggest support levels where theta could consolidate
if theta does have a a relief rally, it is very, very possible
you know, we go in waves to the downside, and we need to spot, you know, those big, major resistance levels, um
and the big resistance level here on theta at the moment would be the one, the 230
we have this big consolidation um from the from january of 2021, where we were getting those bounces
okay? you are getting those bounces from this consolidation area
you've got one here, you've got two here, and then you finally break down
so very likely, if theta does have a big relief rally in the coming days, to potentially two dollars 220
and it's probably not going to go as high, but i am looking for theta to have that continuation of this big, aggressive downtrend
of course, um, after that potential relief rally, where could we see theta bounce? because you want to know levels to to potentially trade
at least me, i want to know levels where i could potentially trade theta
and i do know that that two dollar 230 range is going to be a strong resistance level if we start consolidating here, i would potentially be looking for shorting theta
but what happens if we don't have that relief rally? what is our next big, major level where we could bounce? we're looking at theta
you know, there's a big consolidation that we did create here in september, october, november and part of december, which will be huge, huge level
which level is this? this is the 80, 70 cent level in between 70 cents and 80 cents, where if theta does come down to that range, it's very likely gonna get a big bounce
there's a potential long opportunity at that level, in my opinion
at these current levels where we do see the consolidation from september to december of 2020, you can see a big spike there on the vpvr
we see bitcoin dropping below 25 000, maybe not even below that range
of course, theta, some other alt coins will very likely get hit, of course
if it does go down there, it's very, very likely going to get some kind of shortterm bounce
but these shortterm bounces, you know, on these cryptos, you know, we already looking for a 2030 pump, which is absolutely insane
i'm actually going to put my my alarm here on theta, starting at 80 cents
if theta goes down to 80 cents, i would be very interested in a potential small swing, trade, relief rally
and then, of course, we would be taking a look at major resistance levels to take profits on theta if it does come down to those levels
you know, we're looking for those, we don't, we don't, we don't know if the price is going to drop or pump
but if we pump, where we want to take advantage of big resistance ranges
so also, on theta here, we do have a very good, a very good level where we could get, um, we could get a rejection from this range at the 160 level
this spike over here, this spike over here, fibonacci retracement from this high to the low drop on the four hourly would be the 618
actually, i wanted, i want to choose one or two altcoins and and trade them
because last altcoin, you know, that i've been trading, you know, last month, was gmt token, uh
uh, very, very nice, you know, very, very respected technical analysis with levels, also on gmt um, that made very, very good trade
so, i want to choose an altcoin, um, and, you know, do analysis, proper analysis, and look for opportunities
uh, you guys get an insane bonus if you sign up with a link down below in the description
i get a small commission, but you get the best bonus available
i've got down below a full tutorial on buybit and primexpt to learn how to use these platforms
don't risk too much if you are unexperienced, because, yeah, yeah, it's a very, very, um, hard skill trading
so you got an, also, an insane bonus for all of those experienced traders on prime xbt, seven percent added to your deposit
okay, any deposit at all, up to seven thousand dollars, up to, sorry, a hundred thousand dollars, you get seven thousand dollars on top of that
you deposit a thousand dollars, you're getting seventy dollars to trade with
why not here for andre? um, you're not andre cronje, you're right
trading at 16 cents um, just, you know, a few days ago, absolutely crazy drop
and crow went all the way to one dollar, almost, approximately
look at this round psychological, you know, number one dollar
right now, we also had this, you know, textbook symmetrical triangle
symmetrical triangle coming from a downtrend is very likely to continue the downtrend, break to the support level
as you can see, the symmetrical triangle, um, from the extreme low to the high, right over here
the breakout measured move you know, sometimes you might think, how can this, how can this work? you know, sometimes this textbook technical analysis doesn't work
of course, i wouldn't just randomly trade because of this breakout
but, um, seeing bearishness in the in the stock market and major drops
the measured move, textbook measured move is the back of, you know, the last support level, support resistance, support resistance
and, yeah, insanely enough, from the breakout, you actually meet the target to perfection here
uh, if we take a look at crow, of course, we are looking also same thing
i think a lot of the cryptos are creating a double bottom scenario
um, you know, we've seen, we we can see the the, the, um, sorry, the crypto and fear greed index
um, it's absolutely, you know, there's so much fear in the market
there's extreme fear for the last few weeks, uh, which is crazy
so, how much lower can we go before seeing a potential relief rally? this is why i think, you know, it really fries
so cena, taking a look at crow, we basically came down to retest, almost retest, these lows
um, i think we could see, um, a potential big relief rally on crow in the next coming days, if bitcoin, of course, behaves and the stock market behaves
uh, we could get heavily resistance from this range, if we take a look at crow here immediately
on the short term, let me just zoom in on the crow, because potential short there are some scout
okay, let's just focus on potential trading opportunities, shortterm trading opportunities, scalps, or day trades
there is a big, big level here on crow, at this range, where we do have a big spike on the vpvr
uh, it would be, i would take the last, um, lower high from this big drop
and yeah, this is going to be a potential shortterm trade opportunity right over here on crow that if we do relief rally all the way up here to the 185 cent level, we're hitting the 618 from this major drop, and we're heading a big level on the vpvr here, value area low from this trading range
if we do have that relief rally, you know, we got quite a lot of confluence for the price to to come down
of course, i would be taking profits at 50 percent here of this potential pump, or or aiming for that 618, or even to the for the lows
but i would be careful, just in case you do create a higher low, and you start creating here a small uptrend
but big, big level here, if the price does come up to this range, of course, nothing is guaranteed, but if it does, there's enough confluence for me there to see, you know, that this is a big resistance level
we got big here um value area low here from this trading range on the vpbr
this is just very, very likely, with high probability, going to get a potential rejection here
and then, of course, you will be taking profits from these lows, this consolidation, you know, 50 fibonacci from this pump
okay, just in case you do create that higher low protect position
i'm actually going to put an alarm here also, just to see how we react at that level, uh, for a potential trade
yeah, crow can also be traded on vibe it, if i'm not mistaken
yeah, they cut you can trade crow on private um, uh, avalanche has been uh, oh
i haven't taken a look at avax, have i? alex is pumping today, i think
we've got this range over here where we have been bouncing a lot
looking at fib levels from this high to the low, we'll be looking from this drop right over here
also big, big range where you could get rejected is in between 27 and 28 dollars, 2850
if we start getting that volatility, start creating a double top here on the one hourly, two hourly candlesticks, i would be looking for that potential, you know, drop on on avax um
biggest point of control here from the last 20 days is just at this range
if we do, you might get a spike here, hitting that level, and then correcting down on on avax um
i want to know guys in the comment section, are you still, are you extremely bearish in crypto at this moment? are you extremely bearish? are you extremely bearish on crypto at the moment? let me know, guys
are you extremely bearish on crypto at the moment? let me know
is there more people bullish or bearish? um, let's take a look at btc
bitcoin pumping a little bit right now at this moment, it's having a little bit of a pumpy action
something good about this on bitcoin, at this moment is that we are actually, well, we are, we are hitting the biggest point of control, unfortunately, from the volume traded, you know, the last, um, 15 to 20 days
uh, it's not going to be easy for bitcoin to break above it, but i do think, you know, it is possible
uh, we had a pump, all right, in about a week of 10, almost 10, that in the stock market, 10 pump for s p 500 is a huge amount
um, are you extremely, uh, bearish? on crypto at the moment, we got 74 votes and 50, 57 of people say no
i got, i did make a trade here on knc, protected myself very, very fast
but what happened on knc here, pretty insanely enough, we did get that huge rejection from this level, the 290, 290 big level, right there
just for about a week or so, just over over a week, about 10 days, massive drop here on knc, going from, you know, the below 66 dollar area, 570 down to one dollar, absolutely insane
i do think that knc is possibly going to create a double bottom here, a slightly higher low, double bottom range, and have some bullishness
but this was a shorting opportunity, no doubt about that, at least to the 240
so from 290 to 240, you know, you had a pretty nice trade, hitting major fib level, major support range right there
let me just zoom out at the moment um, we can actually see kn we can see knc get, um, a pretty nice bounce from these levels in the coming days
we've got one of the biggest point of controls here, as you can see, at this range currently, where we trading at right now, at the 190 it's a very, very strong level
looking at the vpvr, um, very, very possible for a for a double bottom, higher low right there
let me just check one second, because there is a possibility that we might be forming, um, a harmonic pattern here, guys
i mean, i don't want to do the the analysis here on the live stream, because it might, it's going to take me some time looking for that potential bearish bat pattern here on, um, on knc, where we had this massive drop the 382
and if we do create a higher low ride over here at the 618 level, there is a possibility you might get that big, big, big relief rally
but anyway, um, yeah, we're not going to talk about that right now
it's actually getting a reaction from the 618 of this pump here
knz, as you can see, um, from the low here to the highs, we're hitting the 618, to the exact scent, to the exact scent here, getting a reaction already
from the low to the highs, six, one, eight, bounce to perfection
you know, if you did get into the exact scent here on the 618 at the 180 level, you know, you're, you could already be up quite a lot
you know, you might think that this is hardly a a very small pump
but, you know, if you use a little bit of leverage, you know, from these low from the 618 level, you didn't have, you did have a couple of days to get in, uh, i know, actually a few hours
you know, this is pumped already 10 from that perfect bounce to the 618 level
and and also, you know, it's the, it's the top of the resistance range from the 12th and 15th of may
there's so many trading opportunities if you do this simple way of analyzing the market, right, when you're using a bit of fibonacci, using a little bit of big resistance support levels
look how perfect you we, we did get that bounce from the 180, it is 618, from the lows to the high
and a big, big resistance consolidation in between the 13th and the 16th of may
then you got this level over here where you are getting rejection
you might think, okay, if i long here, where am i taking profits? you taking profits at big resistance levels
so if you are longing from this level, i mean, look how beautiful you get that balance
there is a possibility right now that you are forming a small inverse head and shoulder here, looking at the two one hourly
you are kind of forming this inverse head and shoulder right now
it does look like that you could see some bullish momentum on knc and potentially break this two dollar
if it does break two dollars um successfully, i would be looking for that retracement and that potential quick trade right there
if you do break it, you're very likely going to come up to the 224, approximately, another big major level
you've got a very nice bonus down below to claim in the rewards hub
you know i am lo i i'm in a long position here from this range
why did i long this? i explained this in the the latest videos
there's a swing failure pattern right there on the one hourly
you are going to get those movements to scare the people and to lose um confidence for for this potential action
i'm still in this long position right there because of that swing failure pattern
my position is protected already, just in case we do roll down from these levels
if it doesn't pump from this range, of course, we'll come back down, but my position is protected
defensive trading, most important thing is to protect your capital, of course
um, apart from gaining, right? so anyway, your question, where would i short bitcoin? well, there is a shorting level over here, which is the 30 500
depending on how we react at this range, um, it might be good short is the value area high from this range
and also, um, but i i only, you know, only if we do see massive wicks here and big, big rejection, because i do think there is a big possibility that we might gonna break the zone and go to the 318k level, that i'm more interested in shorting this range
i'm more interested in shorting the 318 and 32 000 on bitcoin, and then actually shorting 30 500, because i think it can actually break the zone
i think there's a lot of people with stop losses out over here
this is a massive, big liquidity grab because a lot of people might think that the bitcoin price is not going to get above this 30 600 range
uh, it's only looking at the levels, of course, because, you know, i get a lot of people saying, you know, you said you were going to go up
only if we do get a reaction, only if we consolidate, only if we consolidate
i don't get, i don't randomly put limit orders and get in, you know, uh, just because i think we're gonna, we're gonna pump or something
and, like i said, you know, the reason why i longed this level, uh, and i do see that potential move to the upside was because of the swing failure pattern, breaking this low level of 28 600, huge, big, massive wick
i got into the retracement at the 618 level that actually touched to perfection
if i go to the one hourly chart, you know, and see the swing failure pattern, the level that i entered into this long from this low to the high was the 618 that touched to perfection
was in pretty nice profit then, uh, yesterday i was actually slightly in a loss in profits again
now this is the moment, this is the moment you need to protect your position, because you're hitting a big level
now it is worth to to protect the position, because if the bulls don't manage to fight in the next coming hours, you know, between today and tomorrow, it this is very likely going to roll down
you know, it won't be a winning trade, but it won't be a losing trade
looking at fib levels, looking at major levels where the price can get rejected and take opportunity of the market, or where the price can bounce and, you know, and also find opportunities
i'll be doing another video update or a live stream in a few hours
it might be four it might be six hours, i will be doing a video update or a live stream to see, you know, if there's going to be more opportunities
you know, the deal on bitcoin, i've explained it at the beginning of the stream
i've been explaining my major levels the last couple of videos
what i think also the s p 500, you know, massive, big, sharp pattern playing out beautifully
you can check out this video, looking for that potential leg up on the s p 500
let's hope if we are going to see a little bit more bullish action on the s p 500
you've got the bitcoin sensor website to find out the latest news and articles regarding, you know, bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general
we've got guides on how to trade bitcoin, you know, all different technical analysis ideas also here in on the website
in today's episode, i will show you, on both bitcoin and ethereum, what the target is if i would want to buy the market
in case we see the market having a bigger pullback to the upside to create a lower high and then see the market breakdown one more time
or if we actually see the market doesn't have the power to wreck these levels, i also have different levels where i could potentially sell the markets
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly what i see and what i think will happen to bitcoin and on ethereum right now
[Music], let us just start off with the daily chart first of all, and just do everything from the beginning
you can see that we have one, two, almost, three, four, five, six
we got six wicks that came to this level exactly at around twenty nine thousand four hundred three hundred
and what you know already that i do expect the market to pull back down to the week that we do have at 25, 160
but if we go down to the lower time frames, because you can see how the market is respecting the support, uh, that we did have since before
so we're just gonna adjust it a little bit, so looks something like this
okay? so we zoom in, and we need to change it to where the price is at the moment
and if we go to the two daily chart instead, what we can do on the two daily chart is that we take a trend line from the high to and connect it with the wicks that we can see on the two daily chart
go down to the to the daily just to adjust it a little bit if we need to, and it can look something like this
and we go down to the four hourly charts, and you can already see how the market is respecting this level
you can see on the four hourly chart, you can see that we do have some bodies that is breaking it
but if we go to the daily chart, you can see that i connected with the daily candlesticks close
so that is why you can see how perfectly the market is retesting the the resistance trend line and going back to the higher time frames, because we came back down to a support
either you see the market having a bigger momentum to the upside, or not a bigger momentum
but if we drag a fibonacci first of all, from hundred and 31 three back down to twenty eight thousand, five hundred and eighty six, that gives us fibonacci levels twenty nine thousand, nine hundred and fifty and thirty thousand, two hundred and fifty two
if we now go down to the lower time frames, what we can see is that, if we break this resistance trend line, which it actually looks like we can do, this could be where we see the market pull back up to these levels
so these are the first levels that i still do expect the market to pull back up to for then see the market having a bigger momentum to the downside
and you can see that this fibonacci level that i do have is also exactly connected with the with the wick
so if we come back up to this level and we start to see the momentum to the downside
target one will be twenty seven thousand nine hundred and sixty two
take profit two will be twenty six thousand five hundred and seventy eight
intake profit three will be at the low of the week, but we are gonna follow the fibonacci, so take profit 3 will be 25 370
now you can see, we see the market is coming right back up to this resistance trend line
and you can obviously see that you have the resistance, because usually the market is not just breaking through it
even if we will see the market breaking through it, i do believe that we can come back down a little bit, and then the market collect the power to to break to the upside
if we just go to the 12 hourly, because we want to see if we find any, any patterns that is actually actually showing us that we are on a way up
another thing that i can do is that if i go down to the lower time frames, what the first thing that i saw was this little trend line right here
so we go down to the 30 minutes chart, just to see what we can do with this, right? so if we connect the dots from this low with this low, lower high, you can see how perfectly the market came back up and retested that exactly level
and then market slowly and steady had the higher lows that is representing the uptrend, right? so what we can try to do is that we can try to figure out where is the next higher low that potentially can be created
so we're dragging fibonacci from 28 940 to the high at 29 341
we can also go down to the 50 minutes chart, and we're gonna adjust the the fibonacci by just dragging it up to the last higher low on the 15 minutes
so we would change the fibonacci from 29 08 to 5 to the same height
if we say, the market pull back down now for a potential new higher low, before we see the market maybe have the momentum to the upside, we can come back down to 29 215 and potentially 29 185, and then see the the break up, uh, this resistance trend line
but if we see more momentum to the downside, we can also take it back down to the first load that i did have
so what we do is that we just change the fibonacci to see, okay, this just might be where the it just might be this fibonacci level the market will respect
but first of all, i'm gonna drag it up to this low, because it is the first target that the market will come to
and then when i, when i just, when the market, if the market comes to these levels, what i'm going to do is that i'm i'm just going to look at how the market is looking
and if i start to see that the market is actually giving me what i need for me to be able to buy the market, i will go in for a long position on around these levels
so that is why it's really important that when we look at these fibonacci levels where we expect the market to create a higher low
in case the market would, from nowhere, have a huge, like, just a bigger momentum to the downside, what we're going to do is that we're going to use the last higher low, in this case, what to what we have at what prices we have right now
so we're going to take away the big box, and we're going to use the previous higher low that we do have, around eight thousand nine hundred and fifty
so if we see the market coming back down, maybe to these levels too, if we have big bearish candlesticks, and we just break through everything and we break the supported trend line, that is when i look for self positions instead of buy positions
because the market is, i mean, we, we always need to follow what the market is giving us
and that is why it's really good using these different levels to see if they are, we're respecting the higher low and see the market push up to the higher timeframes fibonacci for them the reverse, or maybe the market doesn't have the power to actually break and come up to these fibonacci levels
and you see the market, it's done with the pullback, because we just might also just retest this, this resistance trend line
and then you see the market having bigger momentum to the downside
and that is telling me, okay, this just might be where this we sell the market around these levels instead of the fibonacci levels
on the higher time frame, i only use the different targets to see how the market is reacting to it
i i try to just see if we are actually breaking to the downside or to the upside
and by just following market, i just changed my mindset, because i already have the setups for the uptrend for a buy position
and i also have the setups if we are need to sell the market right away
because the overall view, i still believe that we need to come back down to the end of the week that we have on bitcoin
if we look at the daily chart on on ethereum what i did, i did highlight the support that we did break
i did highlight the week that we on ethereum did feel exactly also what i did expected to do
so i and i also went back in time to see, okay, where is the closest price to if we see the market break to support trendline, that means we can potentially come back down and retest this previous higher low that we do have, around 1 600
so if we just zoom in and try to see what's actually happening, we can definitely see the push back up from the street test that we did have from from the wick, and say, push back up and retest the previous resistance that we do have around 1 900, potentially 1960
and from these levels, you just might see the market drop again
still on the daily chart, what we can do is that we drag a fibonacci from 2140 back down to the low at 1722
so i could definitely expect the market to pull back up to these levels
see the market bouncing between, uh, the support and the fibonacci, and then slowly and steady
same thing, uh, if we see a bigger momentum to the upside, would drag it to the last high that we at, 23, 2342
and this exact same thing that i look for right here, is that we just might pull back up to these levels and then reverse back down to the support again
okay, so i have a dog here, and he's looking at himself in the mirror, and he became angry
i swear he was looking at me, he was like, what? i was just joking

my name is josh, and right now, the bitcoin price is slowly building up to an extremely volatile move, according to the massive squeeze in this bollinger bands indicator
and on top of that, ethereum has now confirmed this new bullish divergence, which i'll be talking about later in this video, alongside multiple other charts
definitely watch to the end of the video so that you're not missing out on any of these important information
and obviously, over the past one day, we haven't seen a lot happen in the price of bitcoin and ethereum, which is why i'm just making the one video today
but anyway, as for levels of support and resistance, we still have strong support at around 28 and a half thousand and strong resistance at around 307 k
and we also have another level of resistance to pay attention to, which is to do with this descending triangle pattern on this four hour bitcoin chart
and this line of resistance is coming into play at just below 30 000, more specifically, at around 297 k, approximately
and so in order for the bitcoin price to finally break out of this price range that we've been in over the past few weeks, would first need to see a breakout above this descending line of resistance just below 30 000 once again
and then we'll need to see a confirmed breakouts above 307 k in order to see any further bullish reversal in the price of bitcoin
and obviously, at the time of recording this video, we have not broken resistance or support
we are simply still forming this descending triangle pattern, which is technically a bearish pattern, because the structure of this pattern obviously shows increased selling pressure and stagnant buying pressure
and statistically speaking, a descending triangle pattern is more likely to break to the downside, but it's still not impossible for it to break to the upside, if that makes sense
and the lot of support for this descending triangle pattern is obviously coming in at this line of support coming into play at around 28 and a half thousand
and as i've mentioned in previous bitcoin update videos, if we do end up breaking that level, then the chances of us revisiting the 25k low would be significantly increased
but even if the bitcoin price breaks below 28k and heads back towards that low that we set a couple weeks ago at around 25k, that would not be the end of the world, because we actually saw that sort of price action multiple times throughout the middle of last year
for example, we have this possible fractal to pay attention to, which i did talk more about in yesterday's bitcoin update video
so i'm not going to go too much into detail about this right here
but anyway, if you're looking at the white bars, that is the price action that we saw around the middle of last year, when we saw the massive bitcoin crash during may last year, and then a lot of consolidation during around june and july
and if you're looking at last year's price action in the white bars, once again, we actually revisited the previous low, the initial low, around two other times before then we finally bottomed out
which basically means even if the bitcoin price goes back towards 25k, that would not be the end of the world, once again, because we have seen that sort of press action play out multiple times in the past
and now, if you're looking at the bollinger bands indicator on the daily bitcoin chart right now, they are having a massive squeeze, which basically means the bitcoin price is building up to another very volatile move
if you're simply looking at the last time we saw a squeeze in these bollinger bands, that was right back here, when we saw a lot of somewhat neutral price action for bitcoin, not a lot of downside or upside price action
and then we saw a squeeze in this indicator, and then we had an extremely volatile move to the downside
and if you're looking at what happened in the middle of last year, this is looking in july last year, basically we saw a squeeze in each bollinger bands indicator, and within about one to two weeks later, we saw an extremely volatile move to the upside
and looking back at some bitcoin price action that we saw in the second half of 2020, during july 2020, we saw a massive squeeze in this bollinger bands indicator, and then just around the corner was an extremely volatile move in the bitcoin price, which obviously was to the upside at that stage
and we saw something similar during around october 2020, once again, a massive squeeze in the bollinger bands indicator, which means the bitcoin price was building up for an extremely volatile move
so the question now is, when will we see that extremely volatile move, and what direction will the bitcoin price be heading in? as now obviously, there's never any 100 guarantees in these markets, so all we can do is talk about the most likely scenario moving forward based on multiple data points, like patterns, indicators, signals and what other markets are doing, like the stock markets, for example
and so to answer the first part of the question, when will we see that volatile move? it would most likely happen next month, so in june
now, obviously, a one month window is a pretty big window, but as we try and narrow that down, we become less and less accurate, technically speaking
and if you're wondering why i'm saying next month, so sometime during june, definitely check out my last bitcoin update video that i posted on the channel
and then as for the direction of the move, that would mostly depend on what the stock market is doing
so for example, over the past one week or so, we've actually seen a decent bounce in the stock markets
and so if this bounce continues into a bit more of a bullish reversal, then it's simply more likely, in that scenario, for that extremely volatile move to be to the upside for the bitcoin price
but on the flip side, if the stock market immediately reverses next week, something like this, for example, and we just continue dumping into new lower lows, then it's more likely, in that case, that the next volatile move could be to the downside
and in that scenario, i'll be targeting potentially around 22 to 23 000 per bitcoin, based on what i said in yesterday's bitcoin update video, but as of right now, simply based on the charts as they are
and also based on the fact that we're seeing extreme levels of fear
personally, i am leaning slightly more bullish than bearish at the moment
but once again, if we see another rollover in the stock market, that could change the situation
but looking at the two day bitcoin charts, we still have an active bullish divergence in play, which basically means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, which has already been playing out over the past couple weeks
obviously, we haven't seen any significant dump in the bitcoin price since we saw that low at around 25k
and if you zoom out to the weekly bitcoin chart, taking a look at the 1000 day moving average coming in at just above 28k, and the 200 week moving average coming in at just above 22k, this gives us an accumulation price range
because historically speaking, every single time where the bitcoin prices entered in between these two moving averages, that has turned out to be an amazing bitcoin buying opportunity time and time again throughout many years worth of bitcoin's history
and to further confirm the best bitcoin buying opportunities, we can look at the weekly bitcoin rsi, which in two cases just here at the end of 2014 and the end of 2018, entered into oversaw territories
and in the march 2020 crash, we saw the weekly bitcoin rsi gets very close to oversold territories, but it didn't quite make it all the way there
and right now, at the time of recording this video, the weekly bitcoin rsi is very close to oversold territories
in fact, we're sitting at around the same sort of values as what the weekly rsi was sitting at at the bottom of the march 2020 crash
and as i said earlier, if we do end up playing out that volatile move to the downside due to these bollinger bands squeezing, then i'll be targeting at least 25k, basically a revisit of that initial low that we saw a couple weeks ago, but potentially as low as around 22 to 23 000, based on the 200 week moving average, where, historically speaking, has shown us the bitcoin bottom time and time again
and while we're on the weekly bitcoin chart, quickly taking a look at the weekly volume for bitcoin, which i talked more about in yesterday's bitcoin update video
but basically, anytime we see a significant spike in volume, while we're seeing a bitcoin crash, that usually means we're either very close to the bottom, or we've hit the bottom for the bitcoin price
but once again, if you want to know more about this chart right here, definitely check out my last bitcoin update video that i posted yesterday on the channel
and now heading into the ethereum parts of this video, this right here is the daily ethereum to yours dollar chance
because obviously we have lower lows in the ethereum daily candle closes for the price action, but we have higher lows in the daily rsi
and due to the fact that we saw yesterday's daily candle close in the green, that confirmed a low in the rsi, which is what we needed to actually confirm these bullish divergence
and so technically speaking, this bullish divergence means that we're due to see reduced bearish momentum in the short term at least, which basically means most likely more sideways, choppy price action and potentially a bit of a bounce
but we'll see, because we still have a lot of resistance ahead of us
and we have previous support, which is flipped into new resistance, coming into play at around 1900
and then anything above that, i'll be looking towards around 2065 and around 2150
dollar, there's not much else to cover, because ethereum normally follows what bitcoin is doing against the us
which is why the ethereum vs bitcoin charts becomes very important, especially during this stage in the markets, because we have already seen a break to the downside from this massive uptrend that we've seen over the past one year or so
and so technically speaking, the larger trend here for ethereum vs bitcoin is a downtrend, which means ethereum is underperforming against bitcoin in this larger multimonth trend
but obviously, in the short term, we're still playing out a bit of a bounce, as i talked about two days ago, because if you're looking at the threeday rsi for ethereum versus bitcoin, we've seen multiple bounces on this dsetting line of support
and looking at the previous three times that has happened over the past one year, that has resulted in at least a shortterm bounce for ethereum vs bitcoin
but considering the bearish nature of the market that we're in at the moment, we would most likely see something like what we saw in january this year
because obviously, at the beginning of this year, the crypto market was still in a very bearish stage in the markets
and so we saw ethereum vs bitcoin play out a shortterm bounce, but not really a fullon bullish reversal
so i wouldn't be expecting too much of a bounce here, before then we eventually roll over
because remember, this isn't a theorem against the euros dollar
so even if we do see some more bearish price action for ethereum vs bitcoin, that doesn't necessarily mean ethereum is bearish against the us
that just means ethereum would be underperforming against bitcoin
and if you zoom out to the weekly time frame, one of the main reasons why i do expect ethereum vs bitcoin to trend lower, potentially over the next coming months, is simply based on what we saw in the last bear cycle back in 2018
and at this stage, right here, at the end of 2018, ethereum bottoms out against bitcoin in the short term, but obviously, ethereum still had another half a year approximately worth of downside price action against bitcoin
dollar, because during the first half of 2019, ethereum was actually bullish against the us
dollar did actually bottom out at the end of the 2018 bear market, right around here
and the reason why ethereum against bitcoin went lower even after the end of the 2018 bear markets was simply because of the fact that bitcoin continued to outperform ethereum in the next bullish recovery
we don't actually see old queen seasons until after we see a bullish bitcoin move, and then bitcoin begins to stabilize
and that is the time when we see an altcoin season after we see a bullish bitcoin move
which is one of the main reasons why my personal crypto investing strategy is to right now accumulate more bitcoin than any other altcoin, ethereum included
and yes, i am lightly dollar cost averaging into ethereum against the us
but those ethereum purchases i've been making are nowhere near my bitcoin purchases
and in fact, nearly one week ago, i did move some of my ethereum into bitcoin to simply hedge myself from this potential bearish scenario from playing out
i'm definitely not heavy into old coins, and i'm not doing any heavy accumulation into alt coins, at least just yet, also due to the bitcoin dominance, which is still in a strong uptrend
and while this is happening, this is not good for the old coin market, but this is good for bitcoin against the rest of the crypto markets
and then, of course, an alt queen season is something like this, where we see a major downtrend in the bitcoin dominance
and that usually happens after we see a massive bullish run in the bitcoin press, which obviously we haven't really seen just yet
but in the immediate short term, speaking about the last couple days, we have seen a slight recovery in some altcoin prices due to the fact that the bitcoin dominance has gotten a slight rejection from this previous high, sitting at around 47 dominance
but at the time of recording this video, this is not a confirmed bearish reversal, at least just yet
which means, technically speaking, the trend does show bitcoin is doing better than altcoins, which is why i'm simply heavier into bitcoin than altcoins
i'm just simply telling you my personal crypto investing strategy based on all of this information
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to make more money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
are we gonna finally break this support level of twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, or is it gonna hold and get a big bounce all the way up to thirty thousand five hundred? i'm gonna talk about this potential scenario in today's episode, analyze the situation here for bitcoin
and we're also taking a look at the s p 500, looking extremely bullish
we were talking about this shark pattern that we're also going to take a look in this episode
so if stocks is bullish, and also the dxy is dropping, and bitcoin is just going sideways and slightly to the downside when it should be pumping when the dxy is going down and also when stocks is going up
so we're going to analyze the situation see if we're going to have potentially a bullish week for bitcoin in this episode
if you are new to the channel, make sure to subscribe dailyte and bitcoin crypto also the live stream to connect with the community
let's dive in here, straight into the bitcoin price, because we have been range trading, okay, in between these levels, twenty eight thousand six hundred and thirty thousand five hundred, for more than two weeks
but there are opportunities inside of this levels, of course, where you can actually make some money
now, let's um analyze the situation here, because i'm actually still in my long position
this has been slightly in a loss yesterday, slightly in a profit right now, here from this swing
i was looking for that potential, you know, bounce to the upside
i'm just gonna leave that trade open for the weekend and see what's going on
and it's a very high risk trade, because, you know, we are in this dead bounce scenario, in a big, massive downtrend
so, you know, the probabilities and actually rolling back down from this range to retest the lows of the 12th of may, is slightly higher
okay? we do have a high probability in actually coming down in the next coming days to retest those levels
but i think that potentially we are going to see some volatility to the upside
s p 500 has had a massive, massive, weak okay, where it's just been going like crazy
this is why, you know, there is a potential, you know, bounce that could happen on bitcoin thanks to the s p 500 and the dxy
small downtrend that we've had in the last few days, it seems like it is lagging
because bitcoin should be bullish if the xy goes down, and should be bullish if stocks also are up
so i'm just waiting patiently to see if we're going to get that balance from these levels
what do you think? will bitcoin come down to the 25, 26 000 range in the next few days? or will it actually come as high as 32 000 dollars? all right, so we are halfway there
i think there there is a possibility that we actually going to come to 31 832 000 um before actually hitting the low 25 000 levels
like i said, you know, we're also getting insanely supported by, you know, the value area low here
and if we take a look at fib levels from the lows also, we're actually bouncing from the 50 fibonacci, from the low created on the 12th of may, until the ultimate high here, created on the 16th of may
we did a wick down below this range, as you can see here on the chart, and then finally got another bounce here at the 50 levels
is it going to manage to hold? this is the question on everyone's mind
it might very likely get broken, because we are in a downtrend, like i said, and, you know, we, we're probably going to see this dead cutback scenario, uh, playing out
so the reason why i am slightly bullish, like i said, we're going to go through right now the s p 500
but before i want to show you okay, the big major levels, if bitcoin were to have, you know, that bounce to the upside, what are the most important levels? of course, we've got the valley area high from this range, which is the thirty thousand five hundred dollars, where we could get heavily rejected
okay? that is also a very high possibility of bitcoin getting rejected here at that thirty thousand five hundred, thirty thousand six hundred
but if we break the zone, we have an important weekly um level here at the 31 773
we have seen that big, major resistance zone over here on bitcoin on the 10th of may and the 11th of may
and if i zoom out here on the weekly, just for anyone that hasn't actually seen the latest videos from this major weekly level, it's from the um from the 12th and 19th of july, close and open weekly, as you can see here
so if we go back here to the two hourly, you know, that is going to be a strong level
if we do start breaking this major resistance at 30 500, i am potentially looking for that rejection at 32 000 levels
if we do break above 30 500, then, of course, there is going to be a lot of training opportunities here, for shorts and for longs, okay? and we'll be going through that, of course, if that does happen in the next coming days
so we're getting ready for those potential training opportunities, of course
if we do have a solid breakout, uh, from this range, you know, hitting 27 500 approximately, or even 28 000, and closing a one hourly, two hourly candle well here, below this range, then, of course, this is going to be heavy resistance
if it does go up there, you know, very, very fast, it's very likely going to get rejected
so there might be a good trading opportunity right over here, also, from that 28 600 dollars
we're not selling seeing any solid breakout swing failure pattern, you know
but there is also, you know, we can see this right over here, where we are creating aggressive lower highs
this is kind of creating a descending triangle, which is insanely bearish
okay? so there is a possibility that in the next, you know, 24 hours, even, that we might be breaking this support level
so the possibilities of breaking down here is very, very possible, of course, as you can see from this descending triangle
because the last few days we were talking about the s p 500 actually bottoming out here and, you know, creating a kind of a double bottom, or the shark pattern that was mentioned when we were trading at the 3 900 at this range on many live streams
guys, if you are interested in trading prime xbt, is absolutely phenomenal
you can trade crypto assets such as s p 500, crude oil, silver, you know, they have a huge bunch of them
and you can use bitcoin, ethereum or stable coins as collateral, which is absolutely phenomenal
and you have an insane bonus down below of up to seven percent, seven thousand dollars, sorry, you do get seven percent added to your initial deposit
you deposit ten thousand dollars, you're getting seven hundred dollars on top of that to trade with
now let's go here, straight into the s p 500, because what has happened here that we've had an excellent run up
i was very much looking for this kind of scenario where the s p was going to create this kind of double bottom with a slightly lower, low shark pattern
okay, looking for that movement here to the upside, potentially hitting 4200, 4250 points, okay, by next week
we had an excellent run up here, going from 4050 points all the way to the 4168 points
absolutely crazy run up here on the s p and i do think that we're very, very likely going to hit this d point, which is round about the 4 250 range, where i would be taking profits, of course, from my long position here on the s p 500
now, uh, what i wanted to show you here this shark pattern, it's very much here
with fibonacci time, the one to one would be on the 31st of may
so we still got a few days till we actually reach that target
we want a nice, you know, onetoone scale, from x to a to b, from b to c to d, as you can see here, very, very nice
and, um, very likely that this level, the 4250 points, is going to be insane resistance
we can see here back in, uh, in the s p500, back in april, it was a very, very strong level, that 4250, 4300, where you do get that massive resistance
so it's very, very likely going to get rejected from this level
and you can also see here on the s p 500 that you actually got the massive, okay, lower highs, major resistance trend line, as you can see, also going to be very, very strong resistance
so a lot of confluence, definitely a take profit area, uh, from this big move to the upside, that 4 250 point area
so this is why i think, you know, bitcoin is bitcoin going to, you know, by monday, tuesday, gonna be looking bullish
because if the stocks are actually quite bullish, s p 500, dow jones, if they've had, you know, a pretty nice bullish week, and they're going to have the rest of the week also bullish, well, this should have a good effect on bitcoin
so this is why, you know, i am slightly bullish on btc in the short term, just because of stocks, of course, stocks
you know, if i see the s p 500 that is bullish, then this make gives me a little bit of more confidence on a bitcoin, of course
the dxy also, you know, potentially, if we do lose this low over here, this last higher low created on the 4th of may, and this big, major uptrend line, as you can see here on the chart, it is potentially going to create a downtrend
maybe not in the immediate short term, but in the midterm, it should have a good effect on bitcoin
if the dollar value goes down, then, of course, it would affect the price of bitcoin in the mid long term
so what i can see here on the dxy that there is a possibility, you know, we've already got rejected beautifully from this major resistance level
i'm talking about the 102, 050 range, uh, we, we did get a massive, big bounce
this was actually the resistance from the lower highs, as you can see
super phenomenal, right over here, from the lower highs created in 2017, 2020
and if i go here to the full hourly chart, you know, you can see that you got that beautiful bounce, okay, on the, uh, dxy
as you can see, from this major resistance turning into support
now, what i am worried about is we are going to potentially get, uh, you know, a relief rally, of course, uh, in this downtrend on the dxy
and that is potentially not going to be good for bitcoin, breaking these levels
but i am looking for the dxy to potentially, potentially create a double top here, or a slightly higher high in the next coming months, or even a lower high
okay? i do think that we are potentially going to create a downtrend on the dxy, because we have been going up for more than a year, guys, and this should have a pretty good effect in bitcoin
check out the bitcoin centre's website for the latest news and technical analysis ideas down below
my name is josh, and in just a moment, i'm gonna be sharing my next bitcoin price prediction that aligns very well with this bitcoin charts, which tells us the bitcoin price should bottom out by the end of next month
definitely watch this entire video all the way to the end so you don't miss out on any of this important information
and this descending triangle pattern is obviously still in its formation phase
just yesterday we saw a perfect bounce from this level of support, sitting at around 28 and a half thousand
and if we see a confirmed break below 28 and a half thousand, then we do have a technical price target down towards around 25 to 26 000, basically revisiting those lows that we set around two and a half weeks ago
but once again, we need to see a confirmed break below 28 and a half thousand in order for that price target to come into play
and at the time of recording this video, we have not seen that, at least just yet
and we also need to keep an eye on this level of resistance coming into play at around 30 000 per bitcoin
and we do have another level of resistance right around here, coming in at around 307 k as well
and if you zoom out to the daily bitcoin chart, as i mentioned in yesterday's bitcoin update video, the daily bitcoin rsi has broken below this upper trading line of support, which usually means that this bullish divergence has now been invalidated
but with that being said, we're still currently in higher lows on the rsi
so technically speaking, we can still be forming another bullish divergence here, because we're still seeing lower lows in the price action, once again, and higher lows in the rsi
and if you look at the last time, where we saw a significant crash in the bitcoin price, a large week to the downside, and then a lot of choppy sideways price action, while we saw a failed bullish divergence, basically, with the daily rsi broke below an upward changing line of supports, we saw a very similar thing during the middle of last year, right after that may crash, which was a significant crash in the bitcoin price
and then after that crash, we saw a massive wick to the downside, a lot of choppy sideways price action, and then the price of bitcoin on the daily chart forms a huge bullish divergence between the rso but then we saw a break to the downside in the daily rsi, which could have technically invalidated this daily bullish divergence
but as i also mentioned yesterday, if you compare this area of price action to what we're seeing at the moment on the twoday bitcoin charts, we are still seeing an active bullish divergence right now, and an active bullish divergence throughout that entire time period, that entire consolidation range in the middle of last year
but the similarities between these two areas on the charts go deeper than that
for example, if you're looking at the weekly bitcoin charts, when we saw that crash down towards 25 000 in the price of bitcoin, we saw a massive spike in volume, showing a big capitulation
and if you're looking throughout many years worth of bitcoins history, usually when we see a massive crash in the price of bitcoin combined with a massive spike in volume
that tends to be either the bottom for the bitcoin price or very close to the bottom, like what we saw in the middle of last year
but then at the end of that crash during may, we saw this huge spike in volume, representing a lot of bitcoin changing hands at that time
but then over the next one to two months, we saw a lot of consolidation in the bitcoin price
basically, we didn't really go that much lower than the initial low, only around one to two thousand dollars lower
and after a couple months of consolidation, basically a couple months of accumulation happening, we then saw a significant bullish reversal in the price of bitcoin
so if you simply copy this previous price action and overlay it on top of what we're seeing right now, to see how they compare, that looks like this on the daily bitcoin chart
once again, this is the price action that we saw in the middle of last year, overlaid on top of the current bitcoin price action
and so far we can even see a lot of similarities in the bitcoin price, this time rounds to what we saw last time
and so according to this fractal, and according to multiple signals that i just discussed, we could be due for a bit more consolidation and potentially revisit those lows that we set a couple weeks ago
but based on this fractal and based on all of those other signals that i just talked about, once again, this means the bitcoin price has either already found its bottom, or it's very close to bottoming out
because, like i said, during the middle of last year, we did actually go a little bit lower than the original low, maybe a few thousand dollars in the bitcoin price, because during may we bottomed out at around 30 000, but during around june, we went down towards around 28 to 29 000 as the actual bottom
and if you're heading back to the weekly bitcoin charts, looking at these spikes in volume, once again, obviously we saw a massive spike in volume during that mass 2020 crash
but we saw an immediate reversal, because we saw a massive fed uturn, basically dropping interest rates, started to print money, all of that sort of stuff
and so if you're looking at the other time where we saw a massive spike in volume here within the last five years or so, during a bitcoin crash, that was basically at the end of the 2018 bear market
but when we saw that spike in volume, that wasn't the bottom for the bitcoin price, but it was very close to the bottom
if you're looking at the exact weekly candle where we saw that spike in volume come into play, we actually bottomed out at that stage at around 34 k
but the bottom for the actual bear market back in 2018 was at around 31 k
and then what we saw was around three months, approximately worth of sideways price action, relatively speaking, just a consolidation, accumulation range
before then we saw a massive reversal in the price of bitcoin after a couple months worth of sideways consolidation, similar to what we saw in the middle of last year
once again, so as of right now, based on multiple different signals, indicators and these previous examples that we've seen over years with a bitcoin's history, the most likely scenario for bitcoin moving forward is to perhaps have one to two months worth of sideways consolidation relatively speaking, just basically an accumulation range similar to what we saw in the middle of last year, or what we saw at the end of 2018, early 2019
but remember, during those time periods right there, we did see a sweep of the lows
back in the middle of last year, in fact, we put in a slightly lower low
and back at the end of the 2018 bear markets, we ended up putting in one more lower low after that spike in volume, which was around 10 percent lower than the initial low that we formed
and so if you measure out 10 below the initial 25k low that we already formed, that will put us at around 23 000, approximately, basically 22 to 23 000, which is right where the 200 week moving average is coming into play
and when you're talking about significant bottoms in the bitcoin price, looking at the 2014 bear market, the 2018 bear market, the march 2020 crash, all of these macro bitcoin bottoms have occurred at around the 200 week moving average
but to be a little bit more flexible, the best buying opportunities throughout bitcoin's history have occurred in between the 1000 day simple moving average, which is the green line, and the 200 week may which is the red line
once again, and as i just said, the 200 week moving average is coming in at around 22 to 23 000, and the 1000 day moving average is coming in at around 28 to 28 and a half thousand
and something else that we also have to keep in mind is the weekly bitcoin rsi, because it is very close to oversold territories
and we have only ever seen the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history
but we don't necessarily have to see the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories in order to confirm a bottom
for example, what we saw in march 2020, even though the bitcoin price bottoms out then, we did not see the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories
it's just if we do, then that would provide an even better opportunity
and now zipping all the way out to the monthly bitcoin chart and looking at the monthly bitcoin macd, simply, based on the two previous significant bitcoin bear markets, which were 2014 and 2018, bitcoin is statistically most likely to find some sort of bottom sometime next month, during june, obviously
and if you zoom into the macd so you can actually see what happened in earlier bitcoin years back in 2014 and 2015, we saw the first ever bearish cost in the monthly bitcoin macd during the 2014 bear market
and exactly five months after we saw that bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd, we saw the bottom for the bear market in 2014, entering into early 2015, and just zooming out a little bit further in the macd
we saw a bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd roughly halfway through the bear market, similar to what we saw in the 2014 bear markets
and then if you measure from that point right there to the bottom of the 2018 bear market, that was exactly five months after we saw a bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd
and the most recent bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd was roughly around four months ago
because if you measure five months out from that bearish cost, that places us in june, so next month, which aligns pretty closely to what i was talking about back here on the weekly bitcoin charts
how we could be in for a similar situation like what we saw in the middle of last year, or like what we saw at the end of the 2018 bear markets
basically some sort of accumulation range forming and perhaps a slightly lower low, but not that much lower than the initial low, based on these previous examples
and if you're using the 2021 example, that could put us in a bit more of a bullish reversal sometime during july or august, as one of the most likely scenarios for bitcoin moving forward, based on years worth of bitcoin's history and multiple patents indicators and signals
but it is really important to mention that a lot of this also depends on what the stock market is doing
for example, if the stock market keeps dumping into new lower lows, then the most likely scenario could change to something else, but while the stock market is holding up relatively okay
so basically, if the stock market doesn't really make any new lower lows, then, as of right now, this is one of the most likely scenarios that i can see based on all of that information that i just shared
and of course, i'll be sure to keep you updated if anything changes
like, for example, if we see a further reversal in the stock markets, i'll be sure to cover that here on the channel and also on my twitter in real time
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even if price is going up, down or sideways
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
this chart is mortgage rate, rate of change of mortgage rates, twoyear rates, oil, gasoline, um and the dollar
it's suggesting we've just had the largest monetary tightening in history
and that what they've done, what the markets have done, because the fed were barely involved
but what they've done is cemented in the kkk, precipitous drop
as i said that the last time i saw something like this was 1974, and it was over pretty quick
now, it depends whether it it's a quick thing or a longer thing
so that's, i think they're gonna reverse, raul as you said, they'll reverse
if they don't reverse by september, the market's going to have significant downside
so i think that's what's going on, is the markets already are anticipating their reversal in the next, you know, a few months
and generally, when you go back in the ism, as soon as the rsm approaches 50, they stop because obviously, below that, you start seeing unemployment rising other bits and pieces
so, you know, i my guess is we we get ism prince of around 52, below consensus, and then by july, it's below 50
i think it's done if the fed goes to 3, right? which is currently in in the in the curve with tips breakevens falling rapidly
i mean, the five year tips break evens down 75 basis points or so in the last month
um, that creates a lot less pain in terms of nominal yields having to shoot up higher than inflation expectations to get to something resembling a restrictive policy, right? if a neutral policy is two and a half, which is what the the dot suggests, and what, you know, our star plus two percent inflation would suggest
and going to three percent actually is not that restrictive, but not, you know, but to your point, well, the markets, through its job owning, um, has, you know, done it's let the markets do a lot of their work
if you look at the cost of capital, mortgage rates, corporate yields, even the discount rate in the discounted cash flow model, it's been a formidable reset
and i think the big question is, you know, how far does the fed have to go above neutral, and how long does it have to stay there? i think the the risk is not so much that it has to go to five percent instead of three, which obviously would be a huge difference, because the, the inflation expectations are already starting to moderate
but the risk is that, you know, the cpi goes from eight and a half, it's now at 82, it goes to five or four, but it doesn't go any lower, and then the fed just cannot, it will have to stay restricted for a long time
and it's not necessarily the end of the world for the markets, but that implies a much lower pe than what otherwise would be the case
uh, i just think the markets have zero chance of that, i, of going above this neutral
and it's, i look, you know, it's unfortunate that they don't, you know, respond in front of data, or, let's say, in the face of obvious forward data
that chart that bro will put up is really all you need to know
anybody listening to this, 30 years of macro experience, and raul, you've got 100 years here on the the only thing you need to know is that chart
and i think it's possible by your end the market could even be up single digits
you know, bitcoin, ethereum, etc, are just being forced down here, um, by this

what is up, my crypto legends? hope you're having a fantastic friday
are we going to manage to get a bounce for bitcoin in the next coming hours? next couple of days
and this is a scenario that i want to explain in this live stream
we're going to take a look here at bitcoin on the one hourly chart
okay? we can take a look at the weekly also to see where could we go potentially, where is the highest probability? and yesterday, what happened is that we had a big, massive drop here, as you can see, or all the way down to roundabout, you know, slightly below the 28 thousand dollars
what happened on the one hourly is that we did have a big, massive wick
okay? we had a swing failure pattern here, as you can see, dipping below this twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
so what i wanna explain now is that, you know, potentially this range is going to hold right over here
we do have a possibility that we might actually bounce from this level, okay? because it's the value area low we've had a failed attempt
so this is a risky trade um that i am taking right now that i'll explain right away
because we've had the swing failure pattern, we're actually hitting the six one eight
from the actual drop of yesterday till the top, we're hitting the six one eight
is it going to hold? it is, you know, the last moment where bitcoin, it could get that bounce
in my personal opinion, if bitcoin does bounce from this level it is now, because of not, we are going to actually drop, you know, in the next coming hours, um, down to much lower levels
so this is why i think this is a, you know, high probability bounce
the only risky thing is that we are, you know, bashing into support every single time
we actually have this attempt, you know, if this doesn't bounce from this level in the next coming hours, uh, you know, a couple of days, then, of course, we could actually break down
and, yeah, we'll be going to much lower levels, you know, in the course of hours, in the next coming days
a few days ago, this is looking at the s p 500 on the 12th hourly chart, where we have this potential shark that could take us all the way up to the 4200, 4250 points
i have been longing this, okay, from these lows, looking for that bounce
because primex bt, the good thing is that you can use bitcoin as collateral
and you are, you know, you can trade s p 500 in other assets, which is absolutely great
i use this platform to actually accumulate bitcoin with my trades
so, yeah, this is something that i wanted to pay a point out there
so, you know, is is the dxy going to continue dropping down? because we've had a huge resistance
all right, we actually drop, dropped out on the dxy from this trend line, you know, that we did put this, uh, ascending trend here, as you can see
and we actually lost the last higher low, as you can see here
so the dxy is looking, you know, a little bit weak in the immediate short term
are we going to manage to continue back down? the only thing i'm worried here on the dxy is that we have, you know, a big, massive bounce here and and kind of retest this, this trend line support to create a double top, or or a lower high, right? this is i'm looking for, that this kind of scenario on the dxy, that this would be the ideal scenario for for the dxy
for bitcoin, of course, we're going to take a look at, you know, gmt
gmt was mentioned on yesterday's live stream just when we were kind of breaking out from these levels, okay, trading like that 117, approximately
we were slightly below already, and we were, we were talking about the most likely scenario on gmt actually breaking this descending triangle and retesting that 80 cent, one dollar low
we actually came all the way down, here we are, retesting these lows
i don't know why i did not take this trade, because obviously, you know, we were, we were, i was idolizing different other other markets
as you can see, this was mentioned on yesterday's live stream, absolutely, you know, to perfection, retesting this low
now the question is, are we going to manage to create that double bottom? we are, we are getting a reaction
is it going to break? you know, i know gmt for me, is a kind of huge, massive ponzi in my personal opinion, because you need a lot of people to come in, all right? you need a lot of people to come in, um, in the actual, you know, game or play to earn, you know, buying these sneakers and, um, they actually pay the people that have been in gmt, you know, uh, with new money coming in
because it's not, it's not basically a sustainable way of earning money
i mean, this is why i think it's kind of going to collapse, you know, in the long run
and this was basically a beautiful trade right there where we were creating that descending triangle, you know, just just breaking here, just managing to close, you know, four hourly, even one hourly candles, already beneath this major level, okay? on gmt, which was the 125, we were saying that 125 is broken and it's very likely, you know, going to continue to the downside
we got a beautiful retest at the 125 and absolutely collapsed coming here to reach the target of this, you know, descending triangle potential projected move
you know, this is something sometimes you're going to say, you know, technical analysis doesn't work
you know, these textbook patterns don't work a lot of the times they they do a lot of the times that they do
we were calling yesterday, on yesterday's live stream on gmt, that this is has a high probability and coming down and retesting this, you know, 80 cent, one dollar range
yesterday's live stream, we were trading at one dollar 17 cents
okay? we're up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus
okay, so you don't pay any fees for 30 days if you sign up with my link in the description
there's also this airdrop, guys, that you have the link down below
if you've signed up with my link and you have more than ten dollars, there's an airdrop for the ethereum usdt, perpetual, up to 100 of a usdt position
you make sure to check it out, because you have here the frequent ask questions on the airdrop for buybit is the link is down below, so you you know, you're probably eligible, and you can claim that up to 100 usdt position
frequently asked questions, how to claim this airdrop? it is down below
what is going on? what is going on guys? what's up? my tether legend says, bernie, yes, tether legends
hopefully, just bought the dip since future etf expired today, then a huge pump
i'm only trading this because, you know, with valley area low, i do see that swing failure pattern
okay, because it is true that we are kind of rolling down here
we have such huge bearish sentiment that i wouldn't be surprised also, that we do have that drop
reason why i entered into this retracement over here just this morning is because of this huge 28 600 level, which we did actually wick just a few hours ago
um, you know, this big, massive wick closing above this range, closing above the value area, high
um, you know, it's enough confluence for me to actually take that trade stop loss here below this low
i am looking at least to reach these highs, and potentially even break it and reach these 32 000 levels
and then potentially, you know, that would be my take profit area when i take profit two
and of course, i would actually be looking for short positions if we do manage to get up to thirty two thousand dollars
how are you doing? dave? how are you doing? i got mark dutch, i got joseph
yesterday we were talking about the the scenario of, if we do close a strong you know, one hourly candle is even enough below the 28 600 then, of course, that would be huge resistance
we would be very likely coming up to this range and getting that rejected to rejection to continue down
but, yeah, when you see this on the one hour late, this is telling me that balls are stepping in, the bulls are stepping in at this range
i think they're kind of looking for those huge short people to short and then get that big bounce, okay, and then potentially continue down
then we have a huge bounce coming back down to the six, one, eight
but, yeah, i was waiting for that one hourly close potentially here, to potentially, uh, to get into that bounce from this level, um
just waiting patiently, we came all the way back down to retest this level
this is the moment for me that, you know, this is the moment we should be getting, uh, a potential big bounds
but you could get that volatility still at this range, and that potential bounce
this is why there's a little bit, i'm you know, there's a little bit of confidence here for bitcoin
if you take a look at the s p 500, it is in a pretty nice uptrend for the last few days
um, i think we could actually get above this range, this level over here, which is the forty thousand, four thousand, uh, one hundred dollars, uh, four thousand ninety dollars
i'm looking for that sharp pattern here that i can go through here on the s p 500
so it looks like we could reach the 4 200 points, you know, by next week
just to give a little bit of information on what i think could happen on the charts, of course, um, is is 27 800
a good long position is 27 000, uh? jad mo here says, is 27 000 eight hundred
i think this range is a potential, you know, risk opportunity where we at right now
but i am looking, you know, the risk to reward here is, is pretty high
you know, if we do get that bounce, you know, i am looking to claim these highs
it's very likely that we will probably claim these highs if we do get the bounds
and, you know, the risk to reward here is already like two and a half to one
my other take profit would be claiming this high over here, which i think is also very, very possible
and i think, you know, it was very likely, potentially to be claimed
so it's, and that's already a, you know, at least this is around about a five to one
so just to be clear here, um, it would be something like this, right? so from this point, stop loss here
risks award looks pretty good, only because of this swing failure pattern
i mean, it is true that the s p 500 is hitting a huge resistance at this moment
you could create that kind of double top here and and and roll down
you have a need to have good risk management under us oil target, please
i've actually entered some shorts at 110, 100, and also 12 slightly in a loss on us oil, but i do see us rolling down
are you looking for us oil targets to the upside? because i'm actually sh i'm actually short
i think us oil is going to crude oil is actually going to going to roll down from this level
there's a massive weekly swing failure pattern, uh, from the highs that we did create in 2011
i know a lot of people might think, you know, the the current world situation with oil, that oil is going to go to 100 and, you know, 50 dollars in the next coming weeks and couple of months, i think we're gonna, we're gonna retrace back down, uh, and and then would potentially go up
but for the moment, yeah, it's, we are seeing a reaction at this major level, and we are still kind of in this ascending channel, i think, i think, in my personal opinion, you know, we are finally gonna get, get rejection from this range and come back down
so i think we're gonna come down to the 100, uh, barrel of oil in the next coming weeks
if we start closing here, major daily candles above this range, then i would be out of my position
if you are shorting this level, you know, invalidation point, would be claiming this high
and this one, you know, you got a big, major zone right there that if you start closing, you know, strong daily candles above this range, then, of course, you know, these short positions that i'm in, i'm, i'm totally out
so i would be out of my positions, because if you do claim this lower high over here, on on a strong daily hitting that 115, 16, uh
then, yeah, i would be happy enough to to close my position because on oil, because it's very likely you're actually going to claim this high
you know, i'd made huge gains on, um, on, on a trade here on oil, on a gartly pattern
let me just quickly explain this, because it was absolutely insane
let me just go quickly here through, um, the bitcoin chart on the four hourly, or on the daily, sorry, actually on the daily
it was a massive, massive um, um fracture here that happened on bitcoin
and it's not exactly the same, but there was a guardly pattern here on bitcoin
because, i mean, guys, if you're here to learn technical analysis and high probability trades, then, yeah, um, make sure to pay attention on this, because i'm going to show you here this ascending channel and this garlic pattern on us oil
also, this is on the four hourly, hitting that, you know, to perfection, the point 78, 79, um, from x to a to b, hitting that, you know, slightly above the six, one eight here, almost there
and i shorted here, uh, the 110, 109 uh dollars here, 109, uh dollars per barrel
and, um, absolutely beautiful, taking profits, obviously, from the 618, of the low here to the high, already taking that, you know, those profits here on on the 618, from the c to d point
so i was looking at bitcoin on the, on the daily chart, okay, where we were in this ascending channel
we were talking about this for ages, and we were talking about bitcoin, you know, getting that resistance from this ascending channel that we created, you know, getting that resistance very likely at that 47 48 000
we talked about this, you know, in the entire march, basically, um, since we created the lows here in late february at the c point
and, you know, there was a beautiful, beautiful gartley pattern that actually played out here on oil also
i made huge gains on this, huge gains on primax bt, shorting this gartley pattern
this was probably on the sixth, or the ninth, uh, you know, in between those days, six and between the fifth and the tenth of may, talking on a live stream about this, you know, potential short on oil, because we add an ascending channel right there with higher lows and and higher highs
you know, oil is gonna, is gonna have a pretty large correction from this level
and, yeah, in just a few days, uh, he made huge gains on that short position, trading on primax
if you're not familiar with harmonic patterns, of course, then i just want to show you this, the gartley pattern
garter pattern is a pretty, pretty insane harmonic pattern that does happen, um, many times on on, on crypto, um, on bitcoin, on any market, any market
you probably can't see this one here, but, yeah, this is basically the pattern
and this played out beautifully on bitcoin here, hitting the resistance of this ascending channel
um, back from march and april, just at the beginning of may, you know, and and hitting that that d point here, the point
it's super important to show the community what the hell is this guy talking about
they're hitting that d point sell point as, uh, the resistance
um, retracement on there, hitting the 618, even slightly below, from c to d point
this is why it's worth taking a look at some other other markets also
um, bondi andy lauren, how are you doing? i'm doing very good
what shall we take a look at? um, avax btc andy lotz um lost its support, says ian gazzard
um, guys, what i need you to do before we continue is absolutely crush that like button
because we're 300 watching at this moment, and we've only got 88 likes
let's continue here and take a look at the avax btc chart here, from ian gazzard
yeah, basically losing this low over here, i guess this these major lows, this major zone over here
the daily chart, let's take a look at the daily zoom out a little bit, dude
i would be a little bit cautious because we are hitting also major support range here on on the btc
um, it's some it's the highs that we did create in may of 2021
and it is true that the bitcoin dominance does look like it is going to gain some steam in the next coming weeks, even a couple of months, and probably go to, um, the 54 55 percent
very likely, a lot of the money from, you know, a lot of the capital of bitcoin, uh, of the altcoin, sorry, will be pouring into bitcoin
and it's very likely that bitcoin is gonna gain some, some dominance here in there in the immediate, short term, next few week, couple of months
and then potentially that would be a very good point to get into altcoins
it might be a few months, it might be almost a year, um, that we actually, you know, recover and hit these levels
um, that would be a great moment to get back into all coins, if that does happen
it's the market makers setting up the market for the next play
andy, can you please take a look at gmt? says, john, yeah, we just did take a look at gmt, so, um
and it what, it's actually getting a pretty nice bounce act from while we were talking
but basically, yesterday, what we did say on the live stream, paul, welcome to the community
yesterday, what we did say on the live stream is that we, we were very likely gonna, you know, the higher probability
and yesterday we did talk about gmt breaking this, you know, we were breaking this descending triangle yesterday
while we were doing the live stream, we already had four hour close below the support one hourly close below this support
and we actually met, uh, we actually get met the lows here to to, to to perfection
looking at that high probability, looking at that, you know, potential projected move from this descending triangle hitting the target here, as you can see, hitting these lows
and now, because this is such a big, big level on gmt, you know, the potential balance here is very, very possible
and, and then maybe you might be creating a lower high here, and then you might actually will break it
i think gmt is, is, is a huge kind of ponzi right? where you do need a lot of people coming in to actually feed the people that have been, you know, in gmt for the last few months
you need more people coming in actually, um, using the application, buying the shoes to gain more
anyway, we got this huge resistance on, on, uh, on gmt at 80 cents
as you can see, you know that double bottom reaction is is inevitable
you got a pretty nice spike on the vpvr because of the consolidation that you had in march
will btc go to 30 um again in the next days, or does it will drop or he says? janik, uh, good question
i mean, the reason why i'm in a long position is because i do think we are going to get a heavy balance
and your question might be, why are we getting a bounce from this level? i'm not going to get a huge amount of indicators
and why do i think we're going to go to 30 000 and maybe 30 500 in the next coming days, coming hours, days? all right
i'm in a small um day trade swing trade position is because we failed
on the one hourly, for hourly, it doesn't matter the time frame, at least the one hourly chart, losing these lows and actually wicking back above, closing the one hourly candle above the 28 600
you know, you're getting the scary action to you to your potentially balanced
and also, we, we are, we at the 618, from this low to the height right there, to perfection
you are getting the bounce to perfection here at that 618 level, which is absolutely beautiful
i will start protecting my position as soon as we claim this high, as soon as we are reaching this high, you know, almost reaching this high, i am protecting my position
i will start protecting my position round about the twenty nine thousand three hundred dollars, because you could get that rejection at the six one eight and roll back down
you still can follow these lower highs, but i, i really like this, this this wick here, and this retest and this bounce
and i waited patiently to get into that position right here, just at twenty eight thousand seven hundred dollars, waiting patiently, entering here the 618 level, seeing that reaction, getting in
it's a bit of a risky trade, because we are in a big downtrend, uh, you know, on a big downtrend
but, you know, um, i do see a high probability in retesting these highs
and then, you know, you might even claim this level, which are these highs over here, and then roll back down
that's a potential scenario that i see right now on on bitcoin
you know, we might just roll down from this range because we are in a big, massive downtrend
there is a, there's a high chance there on a potential bounce
i mean, fibonacci with bots, i guess they are king fibonacci 50 618
what did you trade yesterday to lose everything? i am not even risking one percent of my capital here
i'm looking to have, you know, if, if, if it's good, a few thousand dollars at the end of the month with trading
you know, you cannot lose everything on i don't make trades of hundreds of thousand dollars, not even ten thousands
i'm looking to make, you know, quite a few thousand dollars at the end of the month, which is pretty fine
but, yeah, you how can you lose everything on one trade? this is, obviously, you probably knew, or, i don't know, guys
you know, i am risking one percent of my trading capital, not my portfolio, of my trading capital, to get into positions here
um, at least, you know it's a three to one trade or a four to one trade, the gains should be higher than your your your um, then your risk, right? then your stoploss
uh, how many likes with this will this live stream get? very good
we have 345 people watching at this moment, so make sure to smash up the like button, guys
but looking at volume, basically price action, market structure and potential um patterns and opportunities here
i think gala is a very good project that will do well in the next bull run
i've done some research on this, and it's really, really interesting how this one can be absolutely huge
um, i think this one will be a very, very good, fundamentally, this one is a very, very good, uh, for the next bull run
what is the what? what can we take a look here on gala? oh, i mean, it's, it's at initial price levels almost, we wicked all the way down to the three cent level just a few days ago
i mean, can we go much lower on gala? can we go much lower? absolutely crazy
um, i think a potential retest here from the lows that we did create on the 11th of may is very, very possible
but how much low can this price, can this, um, you know, crypto go, you know, from the initial, from the actual initial launch prices at the three cent level? okay? of of course they that, you know, there are lower, lower prices on the private sale
but, yeah, i think this will consolidate in between you know, three cent level, and and and the actual seven cent level that we are right now
i think this is going to enter a large consolidation range, uh, for the next coming month
and this will be very likely the bear market low, or almost a low
and i think gala is one of those, you know, projects in the gaming space that will do very well in the next bull run
i think it's very, very likely that we are going to retest the lows here, very similar we are
keeping it simple, we are getting supported from this range right now
you know, from the actual um consolidation that we did have on the 11th, 12th of may
you can see on the one hourly we got big, big, big resistance levels we actually hit in this range
now, um, if we lose this level, yeah, no doubt in my mind, we're gonna go below five
we're gonna hit the five, four cent level if we do lose this level
if you do lose this range that we're currently trading at right now successfully with a one hourly candle, then you are very likely gonna gonna roll down to retest the five cent, four, five cent level on gala
but there's also the possibility in getting, getting this bounce
so we could get that bounce from this level also, only if we lose it successfully, closing a one hourly candle well below the seven cent level
i think continuation there's, there are some trades, uh, opportunities if we do lose this level successfully
just to keep it simple here, looking at market structure and support and resistance
what's your opinion, uh, on searching the bottom for btc? on searching a bottom for btc? you think we go lower immediate short term? i think, i think not the immediate short term
of course, the last few days i was talking about, you know, this being a local bottom, this low 25 000 range, being a local bottom
and i am looking for that double bottom scenario or higher low
if we start rolling down here on bitcoin, i'm going to be quite bullish at these levels
and the reason why i do see that that um, that bounce potentially to even 35 000 in the next coming weeks
it's very, very, very highly because, you know, we have been dropping for for a long time
you know, this is a a great example for this, for this um, for this potential low, is looking at the, the, at the coinbase weekly chart, weekly volume chart on coinbase
with these spikes in volume um, you know, you can see the the creation of of a local bottom where you do get a bounce
so i think this is why, in the immediate, short term, the low 25 000 range is a local bottom
if we start dropping here, you know, getting close to 27, 27, 26 000, i think that bounce is very likely
i think if we do get that bounce, we will be creating a lower high
you know, this bear market sideways action is going to be um, at least till end of 2022, and maybe part of 2023
we're going to roll back down, break the lows, potentially maybe hit 22 000 in the next coming months, uh, even so, um, you know, it's very, very possible
i will be bearish once we start hitting, you know, five thousand dollars
um, once we start pumping, of course, looking for that big resistance, looking for that those short on shorting opportunities, looking for that next, you know, lower, high price action, to to get into some trades
ftm, what's going on with phantom? um, let's zoom out here on phantom on the daily first check out, where we at we basically got the bounce on phantom, uh, from the summer lows
we're starting to see big volume here on on phantom at these levels
yeah, we basically got that that huge bounce from the summer lows
it was, you know, very likely to get that bounce at that 20 cent level
you know, you are looking for that balance, you were looking for that balance on that 20 cent level
huge, huge level where we've had huge support in the summer of 2021
and on phantom, basically, i do see, i do see us um retesting the lows, you know, the dead cat bounce scenario here
i think it's very likely that we are going to retest the the 20 23, 24 level um in the next coming days
i think, yeah, this is the the momentum is going to bring phantom back down to retest the low
so, yeah, after that, it markets may crash at the end of of of 2022
i think that, you know, they're going to do any anything to hold the the the stock market till november, hold the stock market, see a little bit of pump the action
and then on the after the elections in november, huge, massive crash
you know, who knows? um, i only date women's with double bottoms
um, these guys from the comment section, they're absolutely crazy
um, when is the midterm election? it's a november, if i'm not wrong, it's in november
um, what is this crypto? let me just have a quick chat here on glmr usdt, uh, glm glmr oh, moonbeam
i mean, this one's, this one's at floor levels, basically, absolutely crazy
i mean, is this one forming a kind of a bear flag, and we're going to go to much lower levels? moonbeam was trading once, you know, up to, wow, you know, it was trading sustainably around about the, 15, not sustainably, but, yeah, the highs around about 15 16
i mean, this could easily be a, be a bear flag and we're going to go to lower levels
if this starts going sideways for the next coming months, yeah, it's basically going to be an indication of floor levels
we haven't got any more price data here that shows us, um, yeah, basically on the launch
it's still very soon to say, because you go sideways here, but you pump, and then you come back down
i think in the next coming months, you know, if you are looking to accumulate this crypto, if we start range trading for the next coming months at these levels, i would say, you know, this is an accumulation zone
if you are bullish in moonbeam, this is right over here, floor levels, you're gonna, you need to accumulate at these levels, basically, for the next ball run
it's very hard on these altcoins to to, you know, for trading
got a pretty nice swing failure pattern on this from, you know, losing these highs, a big, massive wick, closing the one hourly, turning back down
i mean, i i really want to focus more on bitcoin and maybe ethereum, maybe a little bit of stock market at this moment, because taking a look at these altcoins is absolutely craziness in these market conditions
um, retesting the lows, getting that potential, getting that bounce from from the summer of 2021, as you can see here, big, massive bounce, coming back down, losing this major support range
where are we getting a reaction right now? is from the december lows of 2020
if we do, like, lose this level, then it's just going to go too much lower levels
i would stay away from these all coins, because this is just going to be absolutely boring
it's going to look like it's dead, and it might enter an accumulation zone
you know, this is what i am looking you know, we are at the extreme low levels, and it's just gonna be sideways and boring action for a lot of the old coins
if you take a look at ada back in the day, ada back in the day, um, look at this
we are basically tr you know, on a lot of the all coins, we are tr we are here right now
so it's just going to be a lot of boring action for a long, long time, many, many months, even a couple of years, you know, to like, late 2023
it's just going to be very, very boring for a lot of the altcoins
but, you know, we are, in my opinion, we are basically around these levels
we're going to probably go to lower levels, go have relief rallies, then another dump
people, a lot of people are going to lose interest in cryptocurrency when it is the best moment to start accumulating
if you're scared that it's going to go to low levels, just just trade another thing
just go and invest in some other things, because it will very likely go to lower levels
we are potentially going to see a black swan event at some point, big recession, massive panic
i invested heavily back in march of 2020, when everybody was, you know, crapping their pants, you know, massive recession
the actual march of 2020 was the low for the stock market, for crypto
so if you are scared to invest in between this year and next year, yeah, make sure to go and find something else, because we are going to go to lower levels
and this is why i think that a lot of the altcoins are at these levels right now
but, you know, look what happened to ada here after trading at just a few cents for for a few years
you know, when you are here, when you trading here, thinking that an asset is absolutely dead, because you reached a peak and then you go sideways
and this is what is going to happen to a lot of the old coins
a lot of the all coins are just going to go sideways for a long, long time
and then you are going to see, you are going to see this, uh, when you, when you are trading at these high levels, just like what you saw here
obviously, it's not going to happen to a lot of the old coins
it's going to happen to a lot of all coins, but a lot of old queens are just going to die off
can you please check out bmi? bridge mootool mutual index, please? it's insurance related coin, bmi
bridge mutual, it's only got 1 million in market capitalization, 16 million
but this i, i mean, with a a crypto, it's what, i mean, i think insurance is pretty good in the crypto space, insurance related, i think it is
it's probably going to be boring for a long, long time, for many, many months
but this one will, you know, if it, if you do believe in the project, obviously i would have to take a look at the project and do some analysis and see their road map, see what are their intentions, what are they going to do? but it's going to enter a huge accumulation zone
and, you know, this might be, if you do believe in the project
i mean, if we go to the one hourly chart, because it's such a small market capitalization, this is what you're gonna get on the chart, you know, because there's no volume traded
it hasn't got even 16 million, you know, uh, it's a very, very low in volume
there's no analysis to do on this whatsoever, because there's just no volume on the on the chart
so what, what i could say that, you know, on this, the only technical analysis that i can say on this is that, because crypto in general is in a bear market, and we are probably going to see one to two years, easily, of a of sideways action, bearish, uh, momentum, this might enter a huge accumulation zone right over here
if you do believe on the project that is going to do well in the next bull run, potentially in 2024, 25 26, it is the moment to start buying up, if you do believe in the tokenomics, in this project
i will take a look at this, because i am actually interested in insurance based cryptocurrencies
um, i will take a look at this one and do some research on it
um, just, you know, just to see if it's, it is worth the investment
supposedly it's the king of interoperability, meaning that they can change different cryptos from different blockchains
it's kind of been a huge descending triangle at this point, at this moment, and it's actually losing the support level
you know, this one can go as low as one dollar, which was the highs of the summer of 2020
if we start losing this range, i mean, we have to go as far as the weekly right now
the price action was pretty fast from these levels, from the one dollar range, all the way up here to the three dollar area
we are starting to lose the lows here from um, from the summer of 2021 and the lows of february
i mean, yeah, this can be pretty scary price action on roon, down to the one dollar range, which is the highs here
it's the big consolidation that we did have in august of 2020, in november 20 uh, november and december 2020
price action from this level started to go pretty fast to the upside
and what is happening right now? we are basically, uh, coming fast, pretty fast
so the one dollar could be the ultimate low for um thor shane
that would be a very, very good price level to start accumulating some thought, some roon um, let's take a look
uh, what's your thought on luna 20? i think, you know, it is worth the risk
why not put, you know, 05 percent of your portfolios have something, because who knows, it might have an insane recovery
i think a lot of people have lost faith on luna um tara, luna classic
i mean, yeah, this is um, who wants to invest in this? you know, big, massive ponzi? because maximum supply, infinite
they they printed almost the entire total supply in just a couple of weeks
you know who's gonna, yeah, it's who's gonna gain faith again on luna? not me
anyway, is it worth to to to put something in it? yeah, why not? who knows? luna 20, it might have a we live in a crazy world, so who knows? yeah, luna 20, in my opinion, is just a money grow, another money grab
again, let's take a look at aetherium ethereum retested the lows here at the 1 700 range
is it gonna manage to create a double bottom? this is the thing
i mean, we are at a very, very strong level, very, very strong level
let's take a look at the vpvr here, because what we talked about is is this super, super strong level
are we going to create a double bottom? are we going to start breaking below this 1 700 range? uh, very hard to say
you could predict the first bounce, because it's such a huge, important level, this 1 700
so you're basically getting, getting that rejection, coming back down
i'll tell you what, if we do successfully, successfully close our daily candle below the 1700, it is going to be huge resistance
if we have a solid candle breaking down, we are going to get a first bounce here as resistance
if we close a strong daily candle below 1700, meaning hitting 1 600, even 1500, even better, strong daily candle, the retracement is gonna get heavy resistance, at least for one bounce
so that would be the best trading opportunity, uh, losing this level
because right now we've got two options, of course, you either get a big bounce, creating a double bottom
and, um, or you actually break it, because it's the second retest
this is why this is not, uh, there's no high probability direction
in my opinion, there may be slightly higher breaking support to the downside
one second, dude, let's take a look at potential fib level targets
you know, fibonacci expansion one point, one point six, one eight would be a potential target, if we successfully break down here, where we could get that bounce
if we solidly lose this low, which is such a strong level, it's going to be lost with a huge amount of power
and i think we are very likely going to hit the 1 400 1 500 range if it is lost
i want to ask you, uh, what shall i ask you? what shall i ask you? i want to ask you something here
what can i ask the community? i bought a load of chain link and eight plus
i mean, i am a strong believer that chain link will be absolutely insane in the next run
if chain link does drop below five dollars, i am going to accumulate more into my bag
i mean, i think i would be insane price levels to accumulate bitcoin
every two weeks, i do gather up some usdt, i do gather up some stable coins and dollar cost average into bitcoin
you know, the the the name of the game, accumulate as much as you can
can you take a look at cadena, please? says tadeo, absolutely
i think cadena will will find a good, solid accumulation level here at um the 140, 150
the lows that we did create the first week of march, sorry, on the 10th of march, very likely to be retested, which is the 140 level
are we going to manage to create a double bottom? are we going to lose this range and consolidate for a long time? we are just about, in my personal opinion, to start going sideways and slightly to the downside and start creating a bottom for a lot of the cryptos
in the next coming months, it's going to be absolutely boring
we're going to see a lot of people losing interest, a lot of people not coming in to, you know, check out youtube or other crypto influencers, because it's just gonna feel like it's dead, like crypto is dead
it's just gonna be like that, very likely in the next coming months, even couple of years, guys
so you have, you know, an opportunity in accumulating good altcoin projects, bitcoin, ethereum
you know, the what is going to happen is, at some point, i think cadena will do well also, in the next bull run, is that you're going to see such sporting price action for the next coming months
and, you know, by 2020, late 2023, 2024 and start of 2025, you're gonna see people, you're this skyrocketing
and you know, the people, the 100 of people that got into crypto in 2021, in 2022, there's only gonna be five percent left, five, ten percent left actually buying, absolutely buying cryptos, you know, staying in the game
and, uh, that 95 that was in crypto in 2021, in part of 2022, um, it's just gonna, yeah, they're just gonna lose an opportunity of a lifetime
the people that stick around, which is gonna be a small percentage
you can see it on on, on, um, on, what? what's this called? google um, [Music]
google interest, where you are seeing you know, a huge, massive decline and interest in in bitcoin and crypto in general
and this is the moment, guys, this is the moment, like i showed you on on the ada chart
i mean, cadena, i think, is very likely to retest this bottom here at the 140
the question is, are we going to manage to hold it and create a double bottom? i think there is a high probability, because it is the lows that we did create here back in october of 2021
so, i mean, like i was just talking about, you know, looking at um ada from, you know, 2018, 2019, it was absolutely insane
you just think to yourself, right now, to get good um market you know, confidence, you know, people investing confidently right now is going to be, it's good
so this reminds me very much, you know, from mid 2018 when i started to get into crypto
you know, who's gonna invest right here? and this was the best moment um
we gotta see a lot of bearishness, a lot of sideways action the next coming years
you can take a look at google analytics, take a look at bitcoin ethereum, cryptocurrency in general, and you're going to see the interest, you know, absolutely collapsing
don't, don't forget to hit the notification bell when you subscribe to the channel
xrp, let's take a look at xrp, one of the worst cryptos that i, um, do not like doing analysis on
we broke here, this symmetrical triangle, this lower highs, higher lows
as you can see, broke the support and and had a pretty aggressive drop
we also broke this ascending channel, which i did think we were going to go higher, but no, we broke support
and you know, once you break the support from an uptrend, you know the deal
something interesting about xrp is, xrp is very likely going to enter an accumulation zone right over here, between 20 cents and 40 cents
basically, that is the levels that xrp has been trading in the past, for a long, long time, in between 20 cents and 40 cents
and i think xrp will be entering, you know, and another accumulation zone here in the next coming months
we got a huge spike on the vpvr here, um, which is this accumulation zone
it's just gonna very likely enter another accumulation zone in between 20 cents and 40 cents, not much to add
i think it's likely that we are potentially going to create, um, retest the lows
you know, this is the thing, we might a double bottom or right there, or a slightly higher low, double bottom
uh, if bitcoin does get a big bounce, if bitcoin does get a big bounce from these current price levels, um, yeah, we're probably going to see some altcoins actually bouncing back up
you are getting that reaction from the six one eight, from this consolidation, looking at the four hourly closes
balance is is possible if bitcoin does behave stock market is looking pretty strong for the moment um
we might have another bullish week on the stock market next week, and then we might have a big roll that back down
i'm not a huge xrp fan, but it's been here for years, and there's a huge army, uh, it might do well
in the next ball run, probably it will hit, potentially a dollar or two dollars, just like this bull run in the next run
so, yeah, why not? there are some potential gains to be made there
this is going to be, i'm going to do a video update to see what has happened
there is a potential bounce scenario that could happen in between today and tomorrow and the next coming days, like i show you at the beginning of the stream

thank you guys for insane support, and i will see you in the next one
in today's episode, i will show you why i sold the market yesterday at 29 503
i will show you exactly what i see right now on bitcoin and on ethereum, but i also want to show you something new that i do have
so i'm gonna start to have some back testing sessions together with you guys that i will go through a couple of hours
but the session that i did have yesterday was strictly about back testing together with me
and everything is for free, guys, so you should definitely subscribe to the channel, hit the notification
so you know, when i study, i close the chat, i focus on the charts, and i just tell you exactly what i see
and with all of these back testing, that's why i sold the market at 29 503
because the knowledge that you have, you will put it in the chart, and then you will be profitable
i know, financial advisor, you need to look up everything yourself first
please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly what i see right now on bitcoin and on ethereum
i want to start with showing off the trade that i'm inside right now on, buy a bit on bitcoin
and i saw the market yesterday with market execution at 29 503
but then now the market is below my my entry, my take profit is 27 463
so with a little bit of patience, i will show you, uh, why i do believe that we can come up a little bit more and then see the market reverse back down
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
i love buy bit because i can hold my position for a longer time with low fees
if we zoom into what's actually happening right now on, uh, on bitcoin, we saw the market break the support trendline
but yesterday we actually did break the previous higher low that we did have around, let's see, we have this one and this low
and also twenty nine thousand three hundred and fifty, market broke it
one, two, three weeks that tried to break inside of it again, but we did close below
so one thing that can happen right now is that if we drag the fibonacci, just adjust it a little bit now, because we can see that the market just might pull back up a little bit
so i'm gonna drag the fibonacci back up to twenty nine thousand eight hundred and three, and also to this little low that we do have at twenty eight thousand eight hundred and sixty
if we go down to the lower time frames, this could be where you can also see right now that we are at a support
you can also see that we do have this inverted hammer, which tells us that we could possibly come back up and reattach 29 327 and potentially 29 440, for then see the market break to the downside
if we only see a small pullback, we're just gonna adjust it back to this little, uh, resistance that we do have at 29 546
so we just might also first of all, see the market pull back up and retest 29 163, potentially 29 260 also
and then you see the break to the downside, because we did break the support trend line
and this was the support trend line that that showed us the pullback
and the pullback is obviously to the upside, because the overall uh trend is to the downside, right? so you could see the market created a lower low
market creates higher low, highly low, until we actually break it retest
i do expect the market to come back down to this week, first of all, at 25 263
and this was also something that i did talk about yesterday on on uh bitcoin census telegram, is that if we are closing the candlestick on the daily below the support trend line, i i told you that i did expect the market to be bearish
and i still believe that whatever the market is supposed to do, even if we just might also come back up and retest this resistance at 28 985, i still believe that we will only have a quick pullback to either these levels that i spoke about, and then i do believe that the the push to the downside will happen ethereum, if we're just zooming out to see what we're looking at, we did break this previous support
and you could also see that this was a previous report that we also did see the market bounce in between
so if we go down to the lower time frames, we are still below this resistance trend line, which means that we just might see the market pull back up to that level also for a quick retest, and then see the potential a break to the downside
so another thing that we can do is that either we take the fibonacci, first of all, from this high from 1 860 to the low to the support that you can see at 1760, we could potentially see a pullback up to 1808, or maybe 1 hundred and twenty
market creates a lower high against that level, and then you can see the continuation
if we say that the market gives us a little bit more of a pullback, we just might also come back up and retest 1850 and 1870
and that is also combined with this previous support that we did break
so you just might see the market pull back up to these levels, also retesting the resistance trend line, combined with the support, combined with the fibonacci
take profit to one thousand seven hundred, one thousand six hundred and eighteen, and take profit three at one, uh, one thousand five hundred and thirty
so i definitely believe that we will have, we will have a push, push down
but if we were to see the market break to the upside, if we would see from nowhere that we would close above 1910 with a bullish candlestick, that could be us be uh, the market take us back up to 21, 2120
and from these levels, we just have to wait and see, will we break this previous resistance and turn it into support, and then maybe see more momentum, uh, to to the upside, or maybe we just will come back up to this level for just another retest, and then see the drop
so, but first of all, whatever can happen around these levels
we actually don't care about that right now, because that's not where we are
we need to focus on what's actually happening here with the technical tools that i that i just showed you
thank you so much, guys, for looking at this video together with me
hit the notification so you know when i am live or do have my daily updates like this video
and i also want to remind you that every every week, from monday to friday, eight am, swedish time, one hour before london session opens, i do have my morning live streams
even though i'm no financial advisor, i just want to share my thoughts with you, because i think it's really important for us to understand what could happen during the day with all of these different levels
and i've also started with a new thing, that i do some back testing together with you guys
and if you go to my youtube channel, you could see that yesterday, life study become a master trader with me, pen paper, focus, brain
so yesterday we had a lovely back testing session together where i, in the beginning, i just went through bitcoin and ethereum to have the overview what happened during the day and what possibly could happen
but then we went into the charts, and we just back tested it together
i closed the chat just because i want you to focus, while i also focus, because i love to study
i love trading so much, and i want to be, i want you to be part of that too
and i was just thinking, you know what? why not share the knowledge that i have since these four, four to five years that i've been back testing the market every single day? and i know it's hard, so i just want you to be part of that
so don't forget that during nighttime, swedish time, we usually have the back testing sessions together
so share this youtube channel to every friend that you have, or someone that you know want to learn how to trade, because i show you exactly what i see
and you got so many good things from my channel that you can bring to your own charts and just make magic of whatever you already got combined with what i see
i was going on a live like 10 minutes ago, but it was something wrong
i will not have so yesterday when we did have the live stream, i didn't have the lights on
i see that a lot of you guys were on my live stream a couple of hours ago
you know, i hope everyone is feeling good this morning or night, or wherever you are
did you like the live stream that i did have yesterday? if we go into my youtube channel, um, i did have this back testing
did you like that live stream? had it sunk into your head? did you dream about, uh, did you dream about the, the the charts? are you asleep? no, i'm not
yes, guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that, so we can reach out to more people
i will have the the back uh, without lights, because i do actually enjoy it a little bit more
i did explain why to you yesterday, but i can definitely go in inside and show you why i took it
don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
but the good thing with bibit is that when we hold up precision for a long time, it gives us the opportunity to have the very low fees
and if you haven't already subscribed, you should definitely do that
and now i also added up to have, uh, trading sessions with me during, uh, the nights for my swedish time
so if you want to study the charts together with me, and, you know, use your brain for something good, and you want to become a good trader, you should definitely be part of those classes
so don't forget to go in there if you want to be part of, if you want to be part of my community on bitcoin senses, lauren will give you the link to the chat where you more than welcome to be part of because, um, on this community, it's so beautiful, because i can see so many people talk about trading, and they just, you guys just communicate with each other so well
and everyone shows the respect to each other, because we are different people
so just show each other respect, ask questions, because, as i told you, we have so many good people with so much good information
so this is a community for you guys, if you want to find people that want to do the same thing as you, because trading can be really hard
and i just want everyone to connect with each other, because i know how lonely it was for me when i did it
it's a lonely road, obviously, but you can definitely have some fun doing it together with other people
so when you lose a lot of money, you can cry with us, because that is part of the the game, right? so, and until then, we just continue to to learn and see how good we can actually become as traders together, uh, with each other
i just want to say, welcome to everyone, and thank you for taking your time to be on this live stream together with me
because i guess that is also one of the reasons why we want to, uh, why we want to look at these live streams, right? i'm not gonna show you the overview
i'm gonna go down to the lower time frames, because it was from the lower time frames i decided to take the trade
and so what i did was that, okay, so overall, on the four i will chart what i did
um, on the class that we did have, like not so long ago, remember when i talked about, uh, this can this week? did you remember? do you remember, guys? so if you were paying attention yesterday, i was talking about this week and how we always come back down and fill these wicks
um, another thing that also gave me the confirmation that we were actually on on our way down was that the market did maintain the lower highs
um, and based on that, you could also see the market did create higher lows, but it was on the yeah
so when we go down to the lower time frames, we saw the break of structure right here
and eventually the market did break the support, came back up and retested the support trend line that we also broke, and then you saw the market now continue back down
um, another thing, if we would have seen the market broken the resistance trend line created a high high, that's when i go into the charts and look for buy opportunities
so when i took the entry, because i was going in market execution
so usually what i do is that i take a fibonacci from the last high
so you can use different ones, but i think i did it something like this
we came inside the the, um, the support trend line again, but we could also see that
so we did have, on the 15minute chart, we also did have, doesn't it look the same? i was looking at this candlestick
so we market came back up, and i sold the market on this candlestick right here
um, and i was also basing that on the um, hanging man i'm going to show you
so the hanging man is a bearish reverse reversal pattern, right? and when you when you see that happening, even if we come inside the support trend line, but for me, this is just a fake out
and that is also something that we all need to remember, that is, just because we go into the charts or take an order, that doesn't mean that we will be in profit right away
we are right now retesting the 50 that we have on the was it on the weekly chart? i think, yeah
so dxi, why i look at dxi is because when market goes down, um, on bitcoin, it goes up
and this is from we can we could see possible reverse to the upside
so let's say, if we do have some momentum, uh, if we would see that this candlestick, or the candlesticks in a head, would close above 101775
so when you see the market breaking a preview support, and you see this happening, so this is the most important thing now, because if this green candlestick, as i told you, closing above the support, this is technical
you see the retest, remember what i talked about yesterday? we see the retest of the same, the preview support, the real support, as i say it
and that could be where you start to see the market steady, and slowly you can break to the upside
it doesn't mean, you know, we have this huge momentum, but at least as much that might take profit can be taking taken at twenty seven thousand six hundred and six four hundred and sixty three, if we have a little bit push now, right? sorry, i don't have my glasses, so that's why i'm looking inside the computer
but i mean, you could obviously also see the market, um, we have this gap right here
and when it comes to gap, the market is usually usually fill the whack, uh, gap
i don't usually see, um, it's so much on trading, you and i'm not sure if they include them, because on, okay, so on the x the x i, you can see you have a gap here
so, yeah, i would not be surprised if you see the market actually pull back up to these levels
and so if the market pushes back up to that level, because if you, you know, you need to fill this little baby, that is another confirmation that bitcoin will continue down, right? and it kind of looks like that
so, yeah, we were, i'm already in the trade, so the market has kind of already done the move
i'm not sure, because in sweden it is holiday today, but i'm not sure, if, no, it doesn't look like it's gonna affect
i don't know, is there anything special with sweden today? um, btc, may the lower low
market did create the lower high yesterday, and now we can see the market go back
i just explained it to you yesterday, how how beautiful this retest was against the previous support that we did break based on this one
so, um, so that i remember one friend of mine, he told me that, uh, he's shaving ethereum, uh, exactly at the same time as bitcoin
but you can see that bitcoin and ethereum, even though we go to the to the same direction, the move is happening in different times
so that is why it's really important that we analyze the charts in different ways also
but yeah, we're reaching back down to, i've been talking about this, uh, feeling this week for a long time, and we almost came back down
i saw that to measure, we're talking about us 30 when it comes to use 30
i was, we were looking at this yesterday, and i was analyzing it for myself
so we just might have, hello, jason, let's see this on us 30, because use dirt is so volatile
so when we try to correct, uh, holland, california has a holiday in 30 minutes
if the market is not breaking down now, because it can definitely do that
if we see it push to the upside, we just might come back up to 32 634, or potentially 32 652, um, and then see the market break down
but if we look at the lower time frames, it can actually be, it can actually be where the market is reversing back down now
um, market gave us, um, these two candlesticks right here is these two candles
but based on that, we are, we are retesting the 50, these two candlesticks representing a fake out
usually what the market does comes back up, retest half of the fake out and then you see the continuation down
but if i would want to be 100 sure that we're actually on on our way down, i want us to break 32 080 to create a lower low
to find the entry, i dragged the fib from the last high to that low that the market could now
and, uh, like, okay, it's not going to happen today, because i think, um, but maybe two till next week
when the market creates the lower low, we break the previous high low, and that is the break of structure, uh? market comes back up, potentially give us a lower high, and then you see the perfect entry
and this is why it's really good have to have these morning live streams, because now we understand what could possibly happen during the day
not even though you are no financial advisor, you are one hell of a teacher
we can go into some cryptocurrencies and see what you want me to look at now
share me your entry so i can see, maybe i can see what you think thought
but also, when we look at b b, it was a couple of days ago i was looking at this, um, but the last time we did expect the market to pull back up to potentially 335 or 350
so when it comes to fibonacci, usually the market is retesting the 50 on the higher time frames, 300
i'm not sure why you took the trade, but, i mean, you're in profit, so that's good
so the thing that can happen is that you could possibly come back up close to your entry again
so don't be in panic if you see the market come to your um, don't don't be in panic if you come, if it comes close to your entry, because that is also something that usually can happen, is that when you take a trade, the market usually comes to the entry again, and then you see the drop
so based on this fibonacci, if that is the case, we can come back down to 264
so expect, we could expect a little pullback on, yeah, but i don't think, you know, it will, you know, completely reverse
we did break the previous higher low, and that was the one that we did retest
can you see how perfectly this is guys? the last higher low, the the last higher low that represented the the uptrend, market created a last high high against the fibonacci? market broke support trendline
we broke the previous lower low, created a lower high, exac sorry, higher low
market created lower low, came back up, retested the markets last highly low, perfectly, and then you saw the market had to rally back down
so just expect the market to pull back up, maybe, and then see another drop
you can go to solana soul usdt, i forgot i actually have traits on my other um, i just totally forgot that i got other traits too
i put so many trades yesterday on bitcoin, on another and there was some real good profits on that
so when i say that we should control our emotion, you know, sometimes you can be happy
and i'm gonna, i'm gonna tell you the the same entries that i did, that i spoke about, is from these entries
hopefully my computer will not be slow now, because it's so frustrating when it comes to my charger at the moment
and i think that is why my, my computer also gets slow, uhhuh? okay, yeah, it definitely is
we came back up, retested the exact same level, and then you saw the drop
let's see how it looks on the lower time frames, if we could have done anything
i'm not gonna lie if i drag a fibonacci from the break to the low market
did come back up and retest it at 50 61, and then you saw the drop
but, i mean, sometimes we take the trade and sometimes we don't, right? so everything depends on how conf confident we are by using the support, uh, the fibonacci, or whatever
and if we go down to the lower time frames, this is also what we could have done
why would also drag the the fibonacci after the break of the support? is because a previous support just might turn into a new resistance
but with the help of fibonacci, the market came exactly to the right, uh, we came exactly to the right fibonacci levels on the 15 61 percent, at 4570 and 4643
we just might see the market only giving us a small pullback on the lower time frame
so we're going to drag a fibonacci from 429, 4294 back down to the support again at 4054
and that is, these fibonacci levels that we do have at the moment are exactly combined with the support that we also did break
so if we see the market pull back up and retest this level, remember that you're not only retesting a fibonacci level, you're also retesting a preview support
someone wanted me to look at gold, if my computer wants to work with me
it was a long time ago i was analyzing so it's actually fun to analyze some other chart than just cryptocurrencies, because cryptocurrencies look the same
so i'm looking at the three monthly chart, and we look at the previous high at one one thousand, one thousand seven hundred and sixty point five hundred and fifty two
so the market is in the uptrend, but we need some correction, potentially, if we would see
so based on the the the huge volatility that we do have right now, we also broke the support
so break up structure because kind of the higher low, last high low, is here
we drag fibonacci from 1000, uh, 1906265 to the low at 1812 point 170
so we go, we're just gonna, uh, see what actually happened now, take support online, representing the pullback, right? because this is the pullback market creates high highs and high lows
we are right now retesting another fibonacci exactly now at 185500 20
let's see how it looks on the yeah, i can definitely drop from here
but the best confirmation would have been if we actually see the break of this support trendline
so for us to be a little bit more sure that these are not just a fake out to the downside, and you see the continuation up, it would be good if you see the break, you see the retest from below
and that's when i sell the market, because that gives me the a little bit better confirmation that we're actually going to drop
guys, if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can, you know, help me grow the channel and so we can reach out to more people and just, you know, teach them how to look at the charts in an easy way
it would be super sweet of you, while i'm looking at your your coins and i i show you exactly what i do
um, so please like the video, share it also with your friends
i was just going through gold, and you can just, um, go back in the in the live stream
okay, so we did break below 77 a couple of, um, weeks ago, and this is a previous support and resistance zone
um, another thing that we could have done, uh, from the break of the previous support and resistance zone
can you see how perfectly you saw the brake? market came back up, retested it, 15, 16, 15 618
but remember that overall picture, we know that the market would come back down to these fibonacci levels, because on the higher time frames we already have the setup
what we could potentially expect it to do right now? i don't know how nat sleeps a little either
but would you have one right here too? go back in time? no, it's not a special level
yeah, this could be the continuation down because i still expect the market to to drop, at least come back down to 54, because that is the law of the week that i do believe that we will
how are ya? long is is this community channel? yeah, what's the problem with that? can you look at ltc, i was just looking at it
are you not reading? or just maybe you just come into the channel, but someone just said, look at dollars when i was looking at dollars
we came back down to the wick exactly as ex as expected, perfectly
can you see why these wigs are so important to follow? well, everyone is thinking that the market will go up
this is the wick that we can see on the higher time frames, market always come back and retest that or fill the wick most of the time
most of the time, either we take the fibonacci from one point twenty thousand seven hundred and ninety six, or, uh, one point for the two thousand three hundred and seventy three, uh
but we're gonna start off with the low we could possibly now see, because the market created, it created a lower low
so we could possibly come back up to one, one point two thousand six hundred and eighty eight, or one point six thousand eight hundred eight for a potential lower high, and then potentially see the market drop back back down again
it is, it is the weekend, so it just might, you know, we just might not expect the biggest move, but this is definitely a future until next week or so
well, we can definitely happen, but just have in mind that it can happen at sunday when you see, because the market is usually just the market
on fridays, the market find a previous report of resistance, and from that support and resistance, during the weekend, you'll see the market just bouncing between cert two levels
and then you just see the market, you know, having the momentum
on xrp, we're also breaking this previous, uh, i think this is a previous demand, can demand zone that i highlighted a couple of weeks, not so long ago
okay? on xrp, we could potentially pull back up to zero point four thousand and sixty and fourth
uh, zero point four thousand one hundred and ten for a possible retest as a lower high, and then see, um, the momentum again
if this is the case, target one, i'm no financial advisor, just remember that
uh, target one is zero, zero point three thousand seven hundred and nine
take profit two is zero point three thousand six hundred, zero two
intake profit three is zero point three thousand four hundred and thirty five
and as you guys know, we want to see the market actually [Music] retesting them
we just might also say the market only pull back up to, uh, 03, 980 or 04 thousand and six
so if we break these levels, look at the first levels that i talked about otherwise it could be the drop from here
and i would, i would use the same, i would use the same tea piece as the one that i talked about

youtube, idar, frank mckay, philippe, lauren, thank you for the help you did
my name is josh, and right now the bitcoin price is potentially playing out this bearish pattern, while we're seeing the stock markets play out this bullish divergence, which is obviously leading into more bullish price action
so why aren't we seeing more bullish price action for bitcoin if the bitcoin price and the stock market are meant to be correlated? and so later in this video, i'll be talking more about that, comparing the nasdaq 100 index to the bitcoin price
this will be an important one to watch all the way to the end
and you can see right here that this bullish divergence is potentially in danger, because we're seeing a small break to the downside in the daily rsi
but this does not necessarily mean we're going to see a massive crash
because when you zoom out to the twoday bitcoin chart, this bullish divergence is still intact
and the last significance bullish divergence that we saw on the twoday bitcoin chart was back during the middle of last year
and speaking of that time period, what is very interesting is, if you zoom into that time period, on the one day time frame, we began forming a bullish divergence right after that crash that we formed during may
and then roughly around halfway through this massive consolidation range, where we saw the bitcoin price not really go that much lower, we ended up seeing this bullish divergence on the daily timeframe get invalidated because the daily rsi broke to the downside
but even though this daily bullish divergence broke during the middle of last year, we did not see another significant crash to the downside
we basically just revisited the previous lows that we set over the past one to two months
but once again, if you zoom back out to the twoday timeframe, during that entire time period in the middle of last year, we retained that bullish divergence on this time frame
so right now we could potentially be in a time in the market like what we were in during the middle of last year
and that would be important to remember later in the video when i talk about the stock market
and at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is struggling to maintain above this line of supports, which is sitting at around 28 and a half thousand
and this support level at around 28 and a half thousand, once again, is not just important because that's been the support of this price range so far
it's also important because that is the line of support for this descending triangle pattern, which is technically a bearish pattern
and obviously, if you've been keeping up with my recent bitcoin update videos over the past few days, i've been talking about this pattern right here, and how it is technically more of a bearish pattern than a bullish pattern
because the entire structure of a descending triangle pattern relies on lower highs and horizontal lows, showing an increased selling pressure and a stagnant buying pressure, which will eventually give way if the selling pressure continues to increase
and so if we see a confirmed break below around 28 and a half thousand, then technically speaking, we do have a price target down to, what's 25 to 26 thousands
and to confirm the break to the downside, ideally i'd like to see a daily candle close, which is in around four hours from now, at the time of recording this video
otherwise, if we break back above 28 and a half thousands and hold above that level, then essentially this is not a breakout, and instead, it's just a fake out, like this week to the downside the other day
but once again, even if we do confirm this break to the downside and revisit those previous lows, that would put us in a very similar situation to what we saw in the middle of last year
once again, how we've revisited the original lows around two other times before then we bottomed out
and if you zoom out to the weekly bitcoin chart right now, the weekly bitcoin rsi is almost entering into oversold territories, which has only ever happened just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history, which was at the end of the 2014 bear market
and by looking at the 1000 day simple moving average, which is the green line, at the 200 week simple moving average, which is the red line, both of those previous times where we saw the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories, we also saw the price of bitcoin enter in between these two moving averages where we saw the bottom for the bear market
both of those previous bear markets, and even during the massive crash that we saw during early 2020, we bottomed out in between these two moving averages approximately, even though the weekly bitcoin rsi didn't quite make it down towards oversold territories, which means, if we do that is a very rare opportunity that does not happen very often
and if you're looking at the present day price action and the present day rsi, obviously this is lining up really well to what we have seen multiple times in the past, where we've gotten pretty close to some sort of bitcoin at bottom
now obviously it is important to mention that nothing is 100 guaranteed, but keep in mind, if we see the same cycle play out over and over again, we're technically likely to play out something similar at the very least
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the four hour time frame
and obviously, this bullish diversions that i've been talking about for pretty much the last one week is playing out really well
but what i mentioned in yesterday's bitcoin update video was these previous bullish divergence that we saw back here during the end of april, early may
because after the nasdaq 100 index on the four hour charts formed that bullish divergence, we did see some bullish transaction in the shorter term, but eventually we found resistance at these previous highs
but something that is looking really good this time around that we did not see back in this previous bullish dive versions, is what is on the weekly time frame for the nasdaq 100 index, which is simply the fact that the weekly rsi just last week, closed in oversold territories for the first time since the bottom of the march 2020 crash, which was a very rare opportunity in the markets
and if you're looking at the next weekly kindle that came straight after we saw the weekly rsi brush against oversold territories back in march 2020
that following weekly candle was a green weekly candle after we entered oversold territories once again, which is very similar to what we are seeing right now
obviously, with last week's weekly candle close, we confirmed the rsi into oversold territories, and now we're playing out a nice green weekly candle, just like what we saw at the bottom of the march 2020 crash
so you're probably wondering, if the stock market is playing out a bunch of bullish price action this week, why haven't we seen a lot of bullish price action for crypto and bitcoin specifically? and to answer that, we simply need to compare what bitcoin is doing to the stock market
and a lot of the time, you can see right here that bitcoin is heavily correlated to what the stock market is doing
and like i said earlier in the video, with the daily bitcoin bullish divergence failing and the twoday bitcoin bullish divergence holding up, that potentially puts bitcoin in a somewhat similar situation to what we saw in the middle of last year
and if you're actually looking at what happened during the middle of last year, first of all, the orange line is the bitcoin price against the us
dollar, and the candlesticks is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and during the middle of last year, may, june and july last year, after we saw that significant crash in the bitcoin price, we basically saw a lot of choppy price action
but overall, we didn't really go that much lower, if you're looking at the bottom of the candle weeks
and during that time in the market, when the price of bitcoin was yet to bottom out and start a bullish reversal, the stock market, or i should say, the nasdaq 100 index at least, began a bullish reversal back in may, basically at the bottom of that initial crash in the bitcoin price
that was when the stock market bottomed out and began its polish reversal straight away, while we still had another couple months or so worth of sideways, or slightly bearish price action for bitcoin
and there's also some instances where we see bitcoin actually bottom out before the stock market
for example, in the september correction last year, we saw both the nasdaq 100 index and the price of bitcoin enter into a correction, obviously very well correlated
but the price of bitcoin started bottoming out towards the second half of september, and by october we were already in a bullish reversal
but the stock market, on the other hand, bottomed out during early october and began its bullish reversal during around the middle of october, leading into november
so overall, the bitcoin price and the stock market, on these large moves in the market, are very correlated a lot of the time, but not a perfect correlation
so once again, from time to time, we might see a bottom in the stock market before bitcoin, or vice versa, which is potentially another reason to believe why we could be in a similar situation in the market right now to what we saw in the middle of last year, just based on these charts alone
and definitely make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to make more money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so in this video, i'm going to be telling you why you shouldn't be sleeping on a certain project, which is finance coin, which a lot of people have just for whatever reason, started to forget about
i'm going to tell you why this is an absolute insane risk to reward investment right now
and we're going to look at some of the key levels and what price i think it could rebound to
i'm here having a little bit of fun with the crypto banter family
i normally post a little bit longer videos, kind of 15, 16 minute long videos on my channel
but let's try to keep this nice and short for you guys and tell you why you need to get involved with some binance coin
unless you've been sleeping under a rock, you know binance is one of the biggest exchanges in the world
right 24 hour daily trading volume is sitting here at 14 billion
to put into perspective, ftx, which is in second, is 2 billion
so it's 1 7 of the largest exchange finance, which has, by the way, 1300 trading pairs to the 250 that ftx has in second place
but what's also going to attract your interest is the fact they've got an insane burning mechanism
and that's the key thing with binance coin, is they have committed to reducing their circulating supply from 165 million, which is where it's at now, to 100 million
so they're burning consistently, and they're actually increasing this to an auto burn
but to put this into perspective, in q1 of 2022, they burnt 18 million bnb tokens
that's a percent of the supply they've burnt, uh? which, again, when you look at tokonomics, really important that you look at fully diluted market caps
and that's one of the beauties of binance coin, is, you know, the circulating supply is out there
there's no more coins coming into the market, which is preventing the pump ability, if that's a word of the coin
i'm going to come on to the charts and explain why that's important
like so many other projects which we're investing in, have that issue in terms of their tokenomics
they're reducing the supply, making less bnb available, pushing up the demand for the price
we can also then go and look at some of the various things and they're looking to do to improve the network
they've got the descarte hard fork, which they're looking to introduce
and more importantly, one of the criticism finance get is around their centralization
with the bep 131 update, they're going to be moving their system across
so for those who aren't familiar finance coin, the binary smart chain works on a proof of stake, authority consensus mechanism
and you have certain criteria to become a validator, but the most important one, which gives you voting power, is how much bnb you stake
now, what binance have now said is previously the vote of who, from the 41, they pick 21 to be the validators for the next 24 hours, and then they repeat
but with this update, they're going to change it to make it more randomly selected
so even somebody who's taking less binance coins still has a chance to be the validator for the next 24hour period
so again, more improvements to decentralization is a winwin for everybody
because on the charts, what i do want to explain, because i remember very vividly in 2021 when bayern's coin decided to start going on its run
but it wasn't about how it was moving, because obviously the crypto space was moving, bitcoin was moving
but it was the way that binance coin, specifically at the time, was able to sustain its pumps
it didn't need much cooling off periods, which was really, really powerful
and that was evidence around the circulating supply and the burn mechanism really, really working
now, what makes this even more rare is this is not a small cap project
this is a big project that has been there, seen they've done it
has a great leading team, right? great experience, and it's still sitting here in top five coins, all while many of the coins have visited the top five and then dropped back out
cardano solana, you saw what's happened to luna, polka dot, chain link matic
they're all kind of fighting and trying to stay in the top ten
but binance coin has just done it so steadily and kind of, you know, majestically, right? it's just kind of just done it without creating a faster nobody's talking about it, and people are creating videos about it's just strong coin
let's take a look at this, which is the top 50 performance over the last season, which is 90 days
so this is the top 50 coins, right? and what it's saying is, let's take a look at where bitcoin is over the last 90 days
to the left of it, you see all the projects which have outperformed in that period, bitcoin
now, what project to the left of it is the only serious one, really, it's finance coins, the only big project that has outperformed, down only 12 to bitcoin's 22
all the other coins, whether you're looking at cardano dot, uh, you're looking at, uh, cosmos, you're looking at avalanche, they're all to the right hand side, they all fell, as you'd expect, more than bitcoin
how was binance coin managed to hold so strongly, uh, where bitcoin continues to tumble? so then when you combine the two, it creates a really beautiful risk reward trade, where you've got pump ability to the upside of a coin
you've got all the things which will allow it to move to the upside, right? all the tokens in circulation
and uh, just to give you another point around the usability, finance have created such a beautiful nest, a web that forces you, that makes you need bnb to participate in the ecosystem
if you want to participate in their tokens, in the ieos, in the ideas and the launch pads and all these things, you need binance coin
not to mention pancake swap, which, after, uh, uni swap, is the biggest decentralized exchange, right? and for people who don't want to use uni swap
and i know this anecdotally from speaking to noncrypto friends and family
when they want to buy the next meme coin that isn't on an exchange, guess where they go? they go on to binance
they buy their bnb, they put it into their metamask wallet, and they figure out how to use pancake swap
and they don't want to use uni swap either, because the token's not listed there
but even if it is, they don't want to because of the gas fees
and the ecosystem stays healthy despite crypto winters or runs to the upside
now let's take another look, and let's take our move from alltime highs to the fall during the the lunar period
so and you can see here that finance coin is currently sitting about 55 from alltime highs
let's compare that to bitcoin, right? so bitcoin is sitting at about there you go, 58 from alltime highs
and you can see that ethereum is sitting there at 63 okay, so that seems like the in about par with those projects
but now let's go compare it to the likes of solana, which maybe you'll be buying solana instead of something like um finance coin
let's take a look at ada, which you can also put in the same category
again, again, one of those projects which isn't getting the notoriety, but is really holding up really nicely
and when we're looking to invest in our next set of projects, to take us through to the next bull run, we need to be holding coins that are good risk to rewards, limited downside, maximum upside
and something like luna, which is also happens to be a big project, so you can actually hold a substantial amount of it without being worried
you guys know, if you've been watching my personal videos, you'll know that if you hold, if i if i'm talking something like phantom or al grand, i'll be very, very careful of telling you to hold too much of that
but with something like finance coin, you can get a little bit more excited because it's a larger market cap coin being there, done that to hold a little bit more of it, so you can have a substantial piece your portfolio

today we are going to analyze the market, see what's going on in the crypto market
we can also take a look at some different markets, such as the s p 500
all right, and i'm just going to go quickly through the comment section
let's go straight into bitcoin here, and then i'll go quickly through the comment section
i just want to show you here where we at right now, what we could potentially see in the next coming hours
okay? is this going to be the drop that finally breaks this major support level of 28 600? okay? or are we going to get another bounce to the upside? because we have been range trading inside of this area for already more than 15 days, as you can see, from the 12th of may, uh, right over here to the 26 okay? so no, not 15 days, 14 days
but are we going to manage to break this support? are we going to get another bounce? are we going to reach this level? are we going to continue inside of this range? well, this is what i want to explain in today's live stream
okay? if we do have a solid breakout in the coming hours below 28 600, then yes, of course, we could have a pretty, pretty big drop
i think we are going to get heavily supported at the 27 000 range
and like i showed you yesterday, yesterday we had an excellent trade that we mentioned on yesterday's live stream, where we were pumping here
we're saying, okay, if we do get, you know, a roll back down, it is very likely going to get their bounce here to the 29 300
i did long this took profits, uh, most of my profits, okay, over 60 percent here at the 618
we were looking for that, you know, scalp day trade, because it was a couple of hours of trade, all right, from this low
um explained on yesterday's video why we could be getting a bounce from that level, and also why we would be taking profits right over here before even reaching the high
because if we take a look at fib levels from this high to the low, you know, we were aiming for that six, one, eight
it was clearly explained on yesterday's video how we could potentially get a balance here, and then, you know, reach these levels and have that roll back down
so we're going to analyze also, what are the major targets to the upside
where are the next training opportunities? and i'm going to explain in today's live stream right away
it's going to get exciting when, once we start breaking low, okay? because we can take a look at fib levels
and also, what i want to show you, there could be a potential fake out
if we drop here and close a one hourly candle inside, okay, these lows, it is very likely going to get a bigger bounce
we do have a major, major, um a point of control here on this daily level
on the 12th of may, you can see, right over here, you can see the red horizontal line, which is at the 28 380
we've managed to hit this range, okay? but the biggest one from the 12th of may is round about this level, okay, 28 400, approximately
so you could whip down there, break this 28 600, hit that level and potentially create a swing failure pattern
and i'm going to go quickly through the comment section to say, hello
d a, what's your target bottom? well, i think, i think we're not going to successfully break down 25 000
you know, we are, we are about, we are hitting this major support level so many times that, you know, there's obviously two options
you either get another bounce, okay, it's going to be the fifth bounce now in the late, for the last, you know, 14, 15 days
i am more interested if if we do have a solid breakout, solid, solid breakout, the dead cat bounce that we create, it is very, very likely going to get rejected, then i do have higher probability, then you have higher probability in making some gains here
because very likely, you know, with almost 70 percent, okay, of high probability that if you come back up here to the 28 628 500 range, where you have been bouncing consistently as support, we have two big, major levels that we want to take advantage
we want to make some, yeah, we want to make some money here, guys
you know, i don't see, um, you know, i'm not confident if it's going to break and i'm not confident if it's going to, um, you know, potentially get a bounce if i do break down, then it's action time
what are major levels where we could take our opportunities on our first bounce
the first one is the one that has higher probability in getting that rejection
and an example here of getting, um, this, uh, the bouncy from this resistance
now, what if we do have a swing failure? because i'm not interested also, if we do drop down here to from this level, guys, if you drop here, are you going to break out trade? there's a lot of you guys that i do know that you will break out trade
you know, a lot of shorts will be entering as soon as you lose this
but i won't be interested in shorting this, because there is a possibility and a big fake out and a swing failure pattern
and one of the reasons why is because we have the biggest point of control here, from the 12th of may being at 28 400, exactly at that level
we know that these point of controls on the daily are very important
so why not get that bounce from this level? okay? where you're gonna hit this range? close a one hourly candle above the support level
if we do have a failed breakout, it will be time for longing, because very possible you are going to have a big, massive bounce
people that are shorting this range, just a quick explanation here, people that are shorting this range over here, we'll probably put a really fast stop loss
if we're breaking this support, there's no way we're gonna come back in this support again and even break resistance, you know
and you know, that will be a potential long opportunity right there, because you're going to get a lot of people shorting, confused, a lot of trapped shorts
and, you know, you've got a major, major level here, and potentially going to come all the way up here
i will only be, only be confident if we get a swing failure pattern, swing value pattern, you wick below, you close a one hourly inside of 28 600, then, you know, i will be looking, you know, i'm thinking to myself, right, you know, bears haven't got enough power
balls are going to step in, and you might have that big back, massive reversal
if you are longing this potential swing failure pattern, it needs to happen be, you know, don't speculate on long in here, or because, you know, you need to see that reaction
how do you see a failed breakout? well, closing a one hourly candle above this range, once you do have a big wick, for example, and actually having a little bit of consolidation, you can see that that is a failed attempt, and you can get that big reversal
now, take profit area would be this zone over here, above this level
very likely you are potentially going to get that price action to the upside
what if? what if price action of bitcoin goes this side, you know, from this level, without creating a swing failure pattern? well, you could also create that swing failure pattern from these highs
all right, which highs? the thirty thousand six hundred, thirty thousand five hundred, thirty thousand six hundred dollars, depending on how we react to this level
if that happens, you got a potential short opportunity if you start pumping like crazy
i will be looking for shorts at this major weekly level, at this major, big consolidation that we didn't have as resistance
this is not going to be an easy zone for bitcoin to get above
if you, if you start making this kind of price action at this 32 000 level
also, most importantly, from for the last 15 days, guys, super important
value area high and low from the last 14 days, right from this, 30 600 and, you know, 28 600, approximately
luckily, i didn't make two trades, you know, the last couple of days
but if i do see another opportunity, then, yeah, i will be, you know, getting in heavily
i know a lot of you people are holders also, and a lot of people, you know, all depending will you be happy if bitcoin, you know, does go down two to twenty thousand dollars, or or, you know, fifteen, ten thousand dollars
are you accumulating bitcoin? guys? are you? are you accumulating bitcoin no matter what the price is? because i know a lot of people are waiting for lower levels
are you accumulating bitcoin no matter what the price is, guys? let me know in the comments, in the comment section
because i always, from now, i am not always, because i did stop buying bitcoin once we were started, once we were breaking alltime high in december of 2020, i stopped buying bitcoin
and i remember yesterday saying, did you get into crypto? um, did you guys get into crypto in 2021? 2022? and i think it was about 60 percent of people saying, yes, got into crypto
i stopped buying bitcoin in december of 2020, once we were starting to break alltime highs
that is when you need to stop, basically, and think of of kind of selling, right? so, um, i am accumulating bitcoin at these levels
are you accumulating bitcoin no matter what the price is and 60 of people say no, almost of 100 votes
nfa, yes, freddo you you're right? twenty six thousand six uh, twenty six thousand seven hundred, says lin ty's got a potential target there
and i think, you know, it would be the 618 from the low to the ultimate high that we have created, all right, in the last, you know, 15 days, 15, 20 days, as you can see, we, you know, the 27 500 of the 618
well, i do think it is possible to get some kind of bounce, some kind of relief rally there
mark dutch, how are you doing? i put in, i put a long in, guys
mark dutch, thank you very much for joining the live stream here
if we do have a big, massive wick below twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, and we start closing above twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
and of course, where would i put my stop loss would be the question of many, below the the aggressive wick, okay? below the last aggressive wick would be my stop loss
is there a big bounce to 35 k? i'm quitting my job because i think i'll be rich if there is
so you're going to make a lot of money on a long position, potentially
probabilities are slightly higher, and continuing back down after this sideways action, this dead cat bounce scenario, probabilities are slightly higher to come back down
i am looking for that double bottom scenario with higher bottom
and, um, i don't see bitcoin successfully breaking down 25 000
why do i think this? well, if we take a look at the weekly here, you know, we have had a massive swing failure pattern on the weekly chart, breaking the lows here from 2021, and managing to close a strong weekly
now does this mean that we're going to get a direct balance from here? no
because you can feel the wick, you can feel the weekly wick, and then get that balance
you you usually get a double retest once you have a major drop, dead cap bounce, double bottom retest
the closer we get to 26 25 000, i will not be bearish once we go down to those levels, because we're looking for that double bottom scenario, that double bottom bounce
you know, if we come down to 26 000 range, 27, 26, i will be loading up some long positions if we come down there, i'm not going to be bearish
one other thing that was pretty curious that i want to explain here
he was one of them that was talking about this for a long, long time
i've been following, i've been, did follow him back in the day
and he was talking about the weekly volume on the coinbase chart, that does give you a high probability on on, on knowing where the potential top or bottom is
and if you take a look here for the last, you know, three to five, three to four years, all right, you can see that the big volume created on the volume profile, um, sorry, on the volume on the weekly, a big spike in volume on the weekly, uh, can indicate a potential local bottom or a local top
you can see here, i'm gonna just going to give you, you know, five big volume wicks, okay? five or six volume wicks from 2018, indicating a local bottom
of course, you do retest the lows, you do have a little bit of volatility, but you don't successfully break down, okay, the lows
okay, big spike here in may of 2021, um, coming down to the 30 000
so you can see there, local bottom, plus minus a few hundred dollars of um, of volatility
of course, it's not an exact science, but the probability is showing you that you do not break successfully below or above once you have that big spike in volume, guys
so there's a kind of a 80 possibility that, um, in my personal opinion
i would say 75 or so, um, that this is going to be a local bottom, that you can retest the 25 300, which is the low, and maybe get that potential bounce, all right, that dead cat bounce, before we potentially go to lower levels, this only indicates a local bottom
in this case it was a local bottom here, it last quite a few months, alright? almost a year until we actually came below this range
so it can have a dead cat bounce for a few weeks and then break down next month
but local bottom that will potentially be getting a dead cat bounce with high probability, like i just showed you here with the weekly volume, is something to pay attention
so, yeah, guys, um, let me go through the comment section right away
just wanted to give you a little bit of my, um, my analysis on this, of course
what is, what's going on with luna? is there anything exciting to luna is a dead project for me
they had, uh, yeah, they basically, they basically up the project in my opinion
if you are bullish and luna, you know, all the selling pressure, all the capitulation, you know, everything
not financial advice, of course, but if you are interested in luna, you know, now is the moment
it might go sideways, or even slightly to the downside now, for for months or years, you know that yes, luna 20, there's going to be a huge recovery
so, if, but if you are bullish on luna, you know, the capitulation has already happened
so, you know, the question in the poll, are you accumulating bitcoin? we've got over 200 votes here
no matter what prices, uh? 57 percent of people say no, they're not accumulating bitcoin
for any people that are coming in right now watching, this is a no no man's land, okay? for me, because the probabilities in breaking down and and bouncing up is is 50 for me
i think there's probably a slightly higher chance that we actually break support already after retesting these, these levels, you know, for so many times
so am i interested in and, you know, gambling here, if too long or too short? no, of course not
because i have no idea, you know, where the highest probability um trade is once we break this zone
like i said, break these lows, come back up, have a consolidation back above 28 000
this is going to give me confidence to long, because i will see that the bears are losing steam
of course, if we do not see much selling pressure, of course, on the delta, then, yeah, we're not, we're probably going to get that that bounce also
um, what else? if we do get a successful, solid breakout with high volume, we do get that spike in volume and a big breakout, then you might get some kind of quick relief rally
that quick relief rally to that twenty eight thousand five hundred
twenty eight thousand six hundred, for me, is going to be very likely, gonna get rejected at least to the six one eight, from the low to the high
yeah, that leads to the six, one, eight, potentially to the lows
i'm gonna wait patiently to see what happens and position myself at the highest probability trait
if btc gets down to 15k, i'm selling the house and buying book big time
yeah, i'll definitely be buying a few bitcoin at those levels, no doubt about that, no doubt
i mean, that would probably be a, a crazy idea, or a genius idea
i remember back in 2019, uh, when i, uh, got my mom to buy a bitcoin
i was ready invested in in crypto for about a year, or less than a year, and i got my mum to buy a bitcoin
and she was like, yeah, that magic internet money, right? and i'm saying, look, just buy one, you know, i know she had some spare money on the sidelines
please do because, um, yeah, it was early, it was early days, of course
and now we're going to go into the early days in this bear market, from the next bull run you know, there's no doubt that bitcoin will go above 100 000
we do not know if it's going to be in 2024, 25 26, it doesn't really matter
but, um, yeah, back in the back, in those days, we're going to go like, yeah, remember when bitcoin was trading at 25k? yeah
says the phaser, yeah, i mean, this, i think too many people, um, uh
um, but andy, andy looks like george michael now, oh, mark dutch, come on
um, i've been buying ethereum because it's big and performing better in the last year
also, i do think that ethereum is the pipeline for the d5 projects, for 70 of the projects, even more than that, ethereum
so i think ethereum is obviously going to be, you know, um, number one blockchain project
will solana overtake? will ada would overtake? i don't, i don't personally think so
think fake pumpers on youtube, not you falsely pump um pumped
that would be a massive, massive opportunity to scoop up some bitcoin
a lot of people are talking about, you know, sub twenty thousand dollars, you know, hitting eighteen thousand dollars, and even twelve to 10 000 bitcoin
it is possible, especially if the stock market is, uh, you know, it has a big, massive crash, if we see a recession? um, i think it is possible
it won't be in 2024 you might see a wick to the downside, a small black swan event, just like no one was expecting this drop on bitcoin here in 2020
um, so you could get that drop sideways action, you know, potentially hitting 23, 20k levels, and then a little bit of a recovery, you know, getting above 30 000
and then, you know, by late 2023 or 2024, you will get a, like, a a potential black swan event, maybe, you know, taking bitcoin to 15 000 or something like that, and it will be very, very quick
and then potentially a recovery into 28, uh, 2024, uh, finally breaking those alltime highs
just because i've gone through this, and, you know, i know anything can happen, but i don't see a massive, big drop on btc
a big fall in the next coming weeks, even next couple of months, down to the 10k levels
and i do see some people calling for this because they are comparing, uh, this crypto bubble with a dotcom bubble
so if you were to count from 2021 till late 2022, uh, in the next few months, it could happen
i will tell you what that is, gonna be one of the best buying opportunities that you will get if bitcoin goes even close to ten thousand dollars, uh
i had someone here in the comment section, can you take a look at gmt token, one of my favorite altcoins that i have traded the last, you know, month, uh, the last two months, actually
i've only done four trades on this, and it's been absolutely phenomenal
yesterday we were talking about the biggest probability on gmt token was finally getting that drop from this descending triangle, from this range
we were talking about many good trading opportunities back here
end of april, beginning of may uh, also one very nice one here, breaking this kind of big consolidation with this uptrend support line, where we were getting that nice consolidation this level
and what is happening right now on eight point, after getting this resistance at the 170 range, big support level turning into resistance, breaking solidly, getting that beautiful rejection, you know, to perfection
and what is happening right now on gmt is that you are getting volume coming in because you are breaking a solid support level
what solid support level? we got the 126 25, 125 26 25, which is right over here
as you can see, you are creating that descending triangle um, which is um
you can see here, the lower highs, lower highs, lower highs, lower highs, lower highs
so probability, you know, we were talking about this yesterday on, on, on, on gmt, getting this was mentioned on yesterday's live stream
you can check it out, guys, that we were very likely going to come down and, and, you know, potentially break this support level, uh, because there's a higher probability
why is this because obviously, a descending triangle is more selling pressure
of course, you've got the selling pressure making lower highs, lower highs
and the projected move would be the back of this symmetrical triangle cut
of course, now there's not a huge, huge breakout, but i think these lows here at the 90 cent 190 level is very, very likely to be achieved here on gmt
um, let's take a look at the 30 minute chart here, zooming in
you know, is the volume extremely high? a volume is pretty high
so, yeah, i think continuation to the downside on gmt is very likely
stay cautious, because you can, it can get those, those, uh, recoveries right here, and get a little rejection here at the 125, 130, and things roll down
and in the next few days on gmt, let's, um, 200 likes absolutely guys
what's going on? we can get to 250 likes in less than one minute
you know, we can make another 40 likes in less than one minute, no doubt
that would, would that be a double bottom? will we? will we be making a double bottom here on bitcoin? i want to know, will we successfully break down? twenty five thousand dollars? right? i'm going to end this poll
okay, are you accumulating bitcoin no matter what the prices are? and 354 people are saying that, no, they are not
sixty percent of people saying that they're not accumulating bitcoin no matter what price levels
i was accumulating bitcoin in 2018, 2019, 2020, and just getting an average price
anyway, what i want to ask, okay, is bitcoin going to successfully break down? uh, 25k
will bitcoin break let's see how many people are bullish or bearish
or will we be creating a double bottom? will we create a double bottom? let me know
my trading journey is, uh, i started in 2017, 2017, on the german stock market, dax 30, i would i got into a course
i've bought a few courses, many books, and just been focusing hours and hours every single day
and, yeah, you basically learn on what to do and what not to do
so i've been about five years now, experience, and i'm still learning every day
and my what works with me most has been pretty basic, pretty basic trading
but you know, what is really, really nice is the major, big levels of support resistance
volume profile is a really cool, uh, indicator where it tells you where the most strength is on the chart
okay? so when you zoom in, this will tell me that the last 10 days, it can tell you the last month, all right, where the biggest levels are
if you check out yesterday's video we were talking about, you know, this major level
you know, what more do i need? you know, off with fibonacci, with fibonacci and volume profile on the days, on the ranges
okay, what else do i need? when we we can, you know, make a little trade
and all depending on how much leverage and what risk management you have, you can make the week or the month with just a two percent pump
okay? with just a two percent pump that we did have yesterday, you know, with using a little bit of leverage, you, you can make some pretty huge gains
um, and, yeah, basically you know, we were saying about this major level on the vpvr, vpvr
you know, looking for that balance at that level, where to, where to? because you need to have a trading plan
you need to know why are you entering a trade, why you are entering, where you're going to place your stop loss
okay? not not risking too much, just in case we were going to slice through
and i don't mind losing, you know, a small amount where you're going to put your stop loss, where you're going to take profits
most of the people don't fully understand why they are entering a trade, um, and where they're going to put their profit
they just want to leave the trade to go to alltime high, or, or, if you're shorting, go to 20k by tomorrow
of course, you are hitting that 50 fibonacci range also, slightly below, from this low to the highs
and if you pump from this range when you are range trading, because we haven't got a clear, uh, we haven't got a clear trade trend
um, best take profit area here was, they're getting that in that six, one, eight
i took sixty percent of trade of six of my profits here, and slightly in a profit here early this morning
um, from the rest of my trade because, you know, this is like, you know, it's just going sideways
so this can go do this or this, so i just might as well take, take, um, the rest of my small profits that i did have from this from this long but 618 was a great um profit area
this is why you need to have that, that trading plan, right? um, anyone else accumulating egold? i am not, um accumulating egold
chain link has only been the, uh, has been the only crypto i haven't sold, is the only cryptocurrency that i haven't sold
and i started buying chain link when it was just over a one dollar
um, starting buying chain link just over one dollar, and i haven't sold a single chain link, even at alltime highs, 53 or 40 or 30, still holding it
i've been taking profits on on bitcoin, on ethereum, on some other altcoins
the last big spot all coin trade that i made was with metis dao
i bought met i'm actually in a loss right now from, uh, fifty percent of my metas that i did buy at forty three dollars
my first metis that i did talk about, this is a a huge l2 project
this is one of my favorite l2 projects that i think that has huge potential
but they do have some unlocks coming for those private investors
this in a bear market, of course, is not is, is just going to make things worse
but the best spot trade that i made here, i remember talking about medes dial when it was at 43 dollars, talking it on, the, uh, inside of the channel
and the where i took profits was at 300, exactly at this, at this relief rally over here, i had a bad feeling on this, on metis just right over here, that this was going to create a lower high
and then i was thinking, you know, this just looks like it's going to create a lower high
most of the cryptos, i'm thinking, there's only a couple of cryptos that are actually pumping in this bearish trend that we are having, right now
i wish i would have sold all of my medics, but, yeah, this is the thing you need to just, you know, diversify with profits and buying, of course
uh, anyway, we are trading now at twenty three dollars, you know
uh, the fifty percent that i bought is almost at fifty percent loss
but anyway, i i made much more gains on that, you know, seven, eight x here from those price levels
um, if menace were to go to ten dollars, then, yeah, that then i would be a break even almost
let's take a look at ethereum, what is bitcoin doing? bitcoin not doing much
you know, my trading plan, i am basically focusing more on bitcoin
and i know that most of you, most of you guys watching right now, don't look at in their whole video, because i have analytics, and a lot of people, you know, if it's a seven, eight minute video, most of the views are, you know, three minutes
and then you, obviously, you can have, you know, you can take your opinion, of course
what's going on with ethereum? [Music], ethereum has had the drop
what's going on? um, let's go to the this chart over here, right right, right, right
double bottom is is very likely, in my, in my opinion, let's take a look at, let's take a look at the most important support level after this drop
the biggest volume profile spike, the biggest point of control on ethereum from 2021 today
i'm talking about one year, you know, eight almost 18 months, 17 months
biggest point of control is right here, where at the 1 800 range
are we gonna get another bounce here? dead cap balance, before potentially creating a lower high and going to lower levels? i think so
if we zoom in here on the daily we can see um, the the the etherium price here to these low levels, this channel breakout, meeting the target to perfection
we are potentially getting a little bit of a reaction from this range, but ethereum is looking worse than bitcoin
yeah, i think we are going to create a double bottom, or a higher low, higher low, double bottom here
i think we're not going to successfully break down 1 700 lows
and one of the main reasons is because it is a huge, strong level from the summer
it's the summer lows here, as you can see, of 2021, big consolidation here from this reaccumulation in between february and april
in 2022, as you can see here on the chart, big point of control, potential, big bounce is very likely in the coming weeks before we go to lower levels
i do see more downside action in between 2022 and 2023, but i am also looking for that for those relief rallies
if we have big relief rallies, you know, it might be good shorting opportunities
um, this is, this is what i see on ethereum, uh, link is pumping, says seb, right
he he wants to make fun, he wants to make fun of my chain link holdings
it is having a little bit of a drop, but yeah, thanks seb, for that
anyway, my crib, i don't, um, this is the thing, i don't pay too much attention to my portfolio, because whatever i'm investing in in my portfolio, normally, it's just gonna sit there
it is just gonna sit there, no matter if it goes to, you know, 20, 30 x
if i didn't sell any chain link here that i bought in between one dollar and two dollars here at almost 50 or even 30 dollars, then it's silly to sell here, right? uh, even though i'm still in in a profit here, only about a 4x from my, from my, uh, from buying chain link back in in 2019, in 2020, 2019 and 2020
let's take a look at the bitcoin dominance, because it is very likely going to go to about 55, in my personal opinion or so
i was a little bit too soon to see many, uh, all coins, uh, success
i did think that this was going to happen, you know, by end of 2022
bear market kicked in pretty aggressively, and it's going to take quite a long time for the next big hype
when is it going to happen? well, i think, you know, like i mentioned on the v chain chart, for example, like an uh is a perfect example of altcoin to compare against bitcoin, showing with fibonacci time
this is a video that i made a few days ago explaining how the bearish market could last, you know, in between, uh, until late 2022 and late 2023
it's what happens with, you know, the chart is market sentiment, and it's very, you you get into a hype very, very fast
but the bear market, the bearish sentiment, the confidence of people to invest again back into this, these, uh, risky assets, is going to take a long time
we're not going to see alltime high bitcoin very likely this year or next year
and you need, you know, you kind of need to kind of accept it already
and, um, the the to to be confident, for the people to be confident, is going to take quite a long time
anyway, taking a look at the bitcoin dominance, we've broken out this major resistance from these lower highs
it was a kind of a descending triangle pattern, breaking resistance
right now, it is very likely going to have a jump up to around about 55
why? 55? well, it was, it's the, it's basically the projected move
and in a bear market, people move all coins back into bitcoin, right? all coins into bitcoin
and the projected move here from this breakout would be coming all the way here to the round about the 55 percent
it is also going to be a solid, you know, level right of here, big consolidation at this range
it seems like, you know, 50, 55 percent is an average, uh, range where the bitcoin dominance is is going to be
and it's also, it would be also around about the 38 50 fibonacci level, from this high to the lows, right round about 50
so, yeah, around about that range, i think, will be the the top of the bitcoin dominance
this will be a good moment, in my opinion, to start buying, um, a lot of altcoins, once bitcoin dominance starts hitting 55 in the next coming months, potentially by the end of november
it's gonna be the moment where we want to start accumulating good altcoin projects
i don't see the bitcoin dominance coming back to 70, because ethereum has already half of the market capitalization of bitcoin
if if there was to be um, an ethereum dominance chart, i mean, there probably is, but i don't know, you know, i don't know where it is, but ethereum dominance is probably 20, right? if bitcoin dominance is 45, and ethereum's market capitalization is approximately half of bitcoin's market capitalization, then just with that easy math, we know that the ethereum dominance, ethereum dominance, where did i put the ethereum chart here? the ethereum dominance would be a half of 46, approximately
um, if that's correct, right? let me take a look at the poll here one second
so i do see the bitcoin dominance, somebody asking about the bitcoin dominance breaking the lower highs of this range
bearish market for another one to two years, approximately, in my personal opinion
of course, a lot of the altcoins are going to um, move into bitcoin
so bitcoin is very, very possible to gain bitcoin dominance, sorry, to gain 10 of dominance in the next coming months
and once we reach 55 percent, 50 55, it will be a great moment to start accumulating some good altcoin projects, such as ethereum and so many other l1 l2s
so we've got more people that are bearish than they are bullish
who's gonna win? andy, my birthday is near, then, will you send me some birthday all coins? absolutely
i'll be doing some kind of other giveaways, not other, not only on youtube
and you know, these people that are here for the long run, they're obviously going to get some feedback
let's take a look at the ada chart here for sofiane let's take a look at 88
what's going on with 88? right away? ada is just, um, going down massively
ada, i think, is potentially going to come back down and retest the lows here around about the 35 level, the lows that we did create, or even slightly below
why? 35 cents? we've got a solid, big resistance reaccumulation zone over here
this is the beauty about, you know, taking a look at the fast moves to the upside on ada
let me just take a look at the volume profile from this range
look how we came from 35 cents back in january of 2021, all the way up to one dollar
and, you know, since we broke this range, this 88 um cent level, the move has been pretty fast
it's only been less than a week to come down from 80 cents down to 35 cents
38 cents, sorry, was the low so i do think that this level is going to hold 35 cents in the immediate short term
if we do see ada come down, it's creating a descending triangle here
so i think, you know, it's very likely that this, you know, some people could say, some people can say that, you know, this is a descending triangle
you've got a solid support level here, 50 cent level that we are currently just about to break
will it be a fake heart or a solid breakout? um, this is just about to see this in the next coming hours
so it's a descending triangle? or is it a head and shoulder scenario? left shoulder is a little bit too big
but anyway, you can see that you do have a higher, higher level here
so you've got, you know, this kind of head and shoulder scenario, more of a descending triangle
but the lows here on ada are is very light, very likely to be retested
i mean, i just feel like shorting this, but i would stay cautious, just in case it is a fake out
yeah, this does look like it is going to rate go to lower levels
and we're just getting a rejection to perfection from that range
look at this, you know, from these lows, just touching that 49 cent level and dropping right now
yeah, this looks like it's gonna going to continue down, very likely
millionaires are made in bear market, remember that, says mark durch
but mark durch saying, yeah, millionaires are made in the bear market
i love, i love to analyze the charts and the sentiment of the people, because it's just, it
interest is going so down right now on in crypto, and it's when the interest needs to go up
you should be accumulating as much bitcoin ethereum and some other good projects
i'm going to accumulate more chain link because it's an insane project, huge working project
what are we selling? what are we selling? no, this is time to start buying
um, this is the, you know what? you know what happens to most of the people, they have a few hundred dollars, okay, average people, maybe 50, 100, a few hundred dollars to buy into bitcoin
you will buy a few hundred dollars today and maybe next month
and you might think, oh, i wish i would have put my, you know, my three hundred dollars invested from last month, uh, to now
you invest another three hundred dollars here, another three hundred dollars here
it's the best thing i ever did, back in in, in 2018, um, till 2020, best thing i could have ever done
i mean, i had a trend, i've got two trend lines here, one breaking the resistance, going up, retesting the highs, and this one over here, breaking support and getting that daily close
this is why, i, i explain, sometimes when you break a support trend line right over here, it's a bearish sign
but this doesn't mean that you can not, you know, go to higher levels and retest the, the the support as resistance, and then, you know, then you create a swing failure pattern
absolutely beautiful, closing a daily below the the support, uh, trend line as resistance
it's creating a massive, big, a big spike on the volume profile
i think mina is is, you know, it's, if it's not at the bottom, it is close to it
from these highs, though, it is all it is already down over 80 percent
mean, a protocol, could we continue down? yeah, but i think, you know, a potential double bottom
ideal scenario here on mina protocol would be hitting below 80 cents and creating a swing failure pattern right over here, creating a double bottom, a failed double attempt breakout
and then you're very likely going to see a, uh, inverted um bat pattern, inverted batman pattern, and a potential big bounce
what i would be looking for here is a retest of these highs, a retest of these highs where there's a huge amount of liquidity on mina
it's just very likely to happen if you have that swing failure pattern
do you think that chain link will go under five dollars? it is very possible
i was explaining the other day, seeing chilling about in between three dollars and five dollars
i would be accumulating quite a lot of chain link, again, at those levels
mark dutch did pass me a a really interesting video on chain link
i would pass it into the community telegram group if you wish to check out the technology and how companies will integrate the chainlink oracle system into their companies for blockchain and decentralization
and, um, it's very likely gonna be, um, um, a lot of companies will be using it in the next coming years
what is this? um, it doesn't have even a market capitalization
if you haven't, no, if you do not know what i expect for bitcoin
check out the beginning of the live stream or yesterday's video
not too many altcoins, um, a lot of them are, look, look, dude
they're going to go down, such as gmt and a lot of old coins that are having this kind of, you know, roll back down to retest the lows
there is a huge bunch of different um assets here that you can trade using bitcoin ethereum as collateral
but if you don't want to get into the volatility of bitcoin and ethereum to use it as collateral, i use bitcoin to accumulate as much bit bitcoin if i can with my trading
but you can use stable coins such as usdc and usdt on primex bt

um, i'm just gonna wait for everyone to have the time to jump in the call
deepak, hello, how are you? i hope everyone is feeling good today
as i told you, we just wait for the people to jump into the call, and then we're gonna go through what what potentially can happen today
um, now we have some people look at anc yeah, we're gonna look at it in office, making your video
well, guys, if you have not already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
and, um, so we did have the fed meeting yesterday, or a chair powell meeting yesterday
and if it was from this week, right here, let's see we could go
so yesterday we did have the meeting, and that was the one that pushed us up to the resistance
can you see? i don't know if you guys were on my, my live stream, uh, yesterday, uh, evening
and this is why, when i talk about how important it is for us to to have the trend line exactly connected to the to the top of the bodies
because when the market choose to come up to that level, you you see how the market is respecting the previous lower high so perfectly
how can you see how perfectly the market came up and retested my trend line? and that is why it's really important for us to do the back testing and try to understand why, you know, connect the dots
would they have to push up to to yesterday? i i strongly believe that we will have like, a momentum soon
um, man, you got some stuff for saying you think it's going back down, and now alts are dropping hard
i mean, that is the thing, like, just follow, just follow the the rules of trading, and you see the market from a whole different perspective than when you try to see everything as bullish, or sometimes just everything has beverage, you know
so we already have the setting, but we have the setup since yesterday
and yesterday we did have a trend line, a trend line just adjusted, and the market came up exactly
so i just adjusted it a little bit, but, uh, connect the dots
connect the dots, break retest i mean, come on, can you see? i'm just gonna zoom in
and what i also did, so this is on the dxi, but just because this is where i i saw the market breaking, breaking down
so we came up exactly to bum to my fibonacci levels, and we came back down
and at that point on bitcoin, this was when we saw the market push back up, right? but now you can see on the dxi, the market is um pulling back up to create another lower high at the exact same level
we'll look at the previous support that we did break around 102, 102600
but if we would, from nowhere, see the mar uh, the dollar index having a momentum, it would close above 102
but if that is the case, uh, all of these things were just, it's not a fake out
so if that is the case, these, uh, candlestick here is a fake out
and then retest, and then you see the dollars continue to go up
but we are, we can also retest 100, 102280, and then continue to see dollar go down, only for a pullback now, guys, potentially back down to 99300, going to the higher time frames
and that is also where i took my fibonacci level on the weekly chart, from 195 to the high at 1044 403
and that gives me the level where i could pretend, you know, where the higher loan, the higher time frames can be created, and then potentially push to the upside again
but overall, if we zoom out, you can see that we are at the level where the market has been so many times before
i still think that we will can't break through it and come back down to potentially 25k
but before we do that, we just might see the market pull back up a little bit to how far
um, which is my all we could possibly also come back up and retest this previous support at 36 300, and then see it push back down
and if we just use the trend line, remember how important it is if we use the trend line and we see the market from this support
because from this support, if you just connect the dots, you saw the market having the push
it just means that we just might have to pull back up and create a lower high close to the trend line, and then potentially see the drop, right? so this is why it's good to use the higher time frames and then just scale everything down to the lower time frames
because, um, on the lower time frames we will get other support and fibonacci levels before the higher ones
if we break the lower time frames fibonacci levels, we look at the higher time frames fibonacci level
and that is why sometimes i can be very accurate when it comes to the levels
but that is only because i look at the the closest, closest um levels, right? what? oh, oh my god

you look at other people and you just collect the most important things from each and every one
i've, i've been listening to so many different traders, so many good, different traders

this is how you are supporting me in bitcoin census by doing this
and if you haven't already like the livestream, please come inside and do that
so we're gonna go to bitcoin now and potentially see where the market can come to
these are the daily or the higher the higher time frames fibonacci
so i'm gonna drag it from 36 050 back down to so we can either choose to use it against this, this low at this week, uh, the close of the bodies here at twenty eight thousand two hundred, or the wick at, uh, twenty five thousand two hundred
but what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna drag it to the close of the bodies instead this time
how are you? so okay, so on the overall, what we're doing right now is that, on the higher time frames, this is a lower low
and usually what happens is that the market needs to create a lower high and then drop
so until the market choose direction, we obviously need to either break the support trend line or this resistance trend line
and until then, you just might see the market consolidate um back and forth, right? but what we have to have in mind is that we are retesting this strong previous level
if we go back in time, you can see the market has been exactly at these prices before, and you saw the market react to it
you can see that we've been having one, two, three, so many touches
first we had the bodies that close to it, and then eventually what happens is that we started to have wicks, right? we started to have wicks compared to what happened right here
so this means that we just might possibly now see the market having the power to actually break to the upside, right? but what we need to do for me to go in a buy position, by using the prices that we do have at the moment, i need the market to break this previous lower high that we do have at 30 150, for me to make sure that we actually could see a possibility to buy the market, and then see the market potentially come to 32k, or maybe 33k, right? but if we break the support, what i want the market to do is that i want the market to break 29, 030, and we're gonna take away these levels, let's see
because that is the last higher low, right? i don't want to use this one
but so if we break the support, i also want to see what's a retest, and then the continuation, right? so if i choose, if i choose to sell the market, i will sell the market after the break
and when the market gives me the lower, lower high, if i want to buy the market, i need to see the break of the previous lower high, and then i buy the market at the higher low
because if i, if i personally don't wait for this to happen, it's so easy for me if i go into the charts now and trade the market, because i actually have no idea what the market will do, right? so that is why it's really good that we use the confirmations to see, what level are we breaking, what level are we retesting? and does it look like we are having the momentum now? because you've been you see the market consolidate for a while now, and you'll see the market either just break down or just break up
so that is basically what we wait for at the moment, is to see, whoa, when is the market gonna be local? right? so yeah, just waiting game on bitcoin
so we're just gonna take away these things because, [Music], i still need to wait
so that is exactly combined with this previous support and resistance zones that we do have
and we try like this also, we try to connect the dots with the previous high
no, not with the previous high, with a previous resistance, with a previous resistance zone and with a support
right, right now, right? and just because we see the market come back down, no, we just might see the market pull back down to 1 900 or 1880, potentially
and i mean, of course, either we see the continuation down, or we just come back down to the support for then have a push to the upside, right? so kind of just waiting game at the moment
how are ya guys? what do you think will happen? what do you think will happen? yeah
so either we just see the market pull back up to retest, potentially, because remember that never want to sell the market at the low
we just might see the market pull back up and retest this previous support trend line that we did break
and then you see the continuation if we close inside the support, potentially around 1940, that could be where the market starts to break up
i'm gonna put an alert on the support streamline also if we see the market pulling back up to that level
in case, hello nadia, how are you? okay, i want to go to use 30 and see what happens here
and you can see how the 50 is just combined with the low at 32 750
so when it comes to use 30, we are, we are, slightly above other fibonacci, uh, fibonacci levels on the lower time frames now, between 32 080 and 31 870
if we will respect this fibonacci level, what i want the market to do is that i want the market to break this previous high low
and that's what, if the market does that, that's when i take another fibonacci from that high to that break to that low
and fibonacci will give me levels where i could potentially buy the sell the market from
but we need to break this previous highly low to create a lower low, because that is a break of structure
market comes back up for a potential retest break, but if we continue to see the market having some momentum to the upside, now you just might see the market come back down and create another high low at the exact length, exact same level that i spoke about, and then see market push back up to 32 740 or 33 250
we're just waiting for the market to, you know, potentially break down because we need to, we need to, yeah, we just need to see where, where the break of structure will be
um, how do you draw your face? uh, i draw my fibs from, usually from body to body, but sometimes from week to week or butter to wig
um, okay, so let's see if there's any coin that you want me to look at
so last time we were looking at sale, we did exactly what, uh, we expected the market to do
market came up exactly and retested the fibonacci levels on the higher time frames, also on the lower time frame
we tested zero, five thousand seven hundred, around that level
um, but we're just gonna take everything away and just refresh everything
market came up exactly, created a lower another lower high, and then you see the break, break of structure
so what we're gonna do, if we say, pull back, we'll drag the fibonacci from 5847 to the low at 04 983
even if you see the market come back down at the moment, if we see the reverse back up, we could potentially retest 5009 hundred and twenty, potentially five thousand five hundred and twenty four for a lower high, and then see the the breakdown again
if that is the case, take profit one is four thousand seven hundred and eighty
and take profit three is three thousand nine hundred and fifty five
remember that always, um, if we have a and if we break these levels, if if we even come up to them, um, we could look at five thousand seven hundred, potentially five thousand nine uh, five thousand nine hundred and eighty four, then a break, uh, pull back down, right? um
so everything depends on, we just might also see the the drop, which is my also, because you see, we have different levels everywhere
you just might also see the market come back and retest these fibonacci levels on the 15 minute [Music]
is it better now? so we're dragging fibonacci on the 50 minute shot from 5256 back down to the low at four thousand nine hundred and forty six
that means that connected with this little support trendline that we did break
from these levels, you just might also see the drop, right? so everything depends on the volatility and where, where the market will respect
what what levels will the market respect? this is why you see so many things on the charts right now
obviously, this is not usually how i have it, but you get the point
i woke up because i want to watch you guys, if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can help me to grow the channel, so we can reach out to more people and show them how to look at the charts in an easy way

and don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and this is how you are supporting, supporting bitcoin census
and me, the good thing as being a trader is that we can obviously trade the market when market goes down and up
and by bit is really good if we want to hold our positions for a longer time, as more as swing trading, and with very low fees
but now we're going to go to gmt, and we're just going to start over from the weekly charts
i do believe that we will come back down to this week, that we do have at eight eighty four thousand one hundred and ninety
it's a break of structure, right? okay, so we see the market drop right now
um, can we share a trade a day in telegram to confirm? yes, of course
that that's what the whole point is with that, is that you, you just share your thoughts, right? share your thoughts, nothing more than that
so we dragged fibonacci from 139 650 to the low at 1 200, 12, 23, 750
we just might see, potentially, us pull back up to one point thirty one thousand six hundred and fifty five, one point thirty three thousand five hundred and twenty, and then potentially see a reverse back down
take profit one would be one point twenty thousand one hundred and thirty two
take profit two will be one point eleven thousand nine seven hundred nineteen
but that is only if you see the market pull back up to these levels
rita's from above these fibonacci levels, is not valid at all
so we use the end of this week, because this is where i do believe that we can come to
we came up to the high time frame fibonacci levels, you can see right here, go down
so if we see another pullback, because remember that the market is now creating a lower low, guys
so if we want to see pullback, we could potentially use, uh, 23, 2, 2328
if we only see a small pullback, we just might only come back up and retest 2210, and potentially two thousand two hundred and twenty two, and then see the continuation of the drop
so these are the levels that i i expect, potentially the market to reverse back to
so the first ones, if we break them and market doesn't care, well, then we just need to change your mindset and, you know, look at other levels where the market can potentially come to
fibonacci levels at nine, nine thousand, nine thousand six hundred and ninety six and one, ten thousand four hundred and forty
if we see the market having a big momentum to the upside, these are the levels where i expect the market to come to and then drop
but if you're just zooming to what we look at in the four hourly, so what i did was that i took a fib from 8452 back down to the support at six thousand four hundred, six thousand four hundred thirty market came back up to these fibonacci levels, and you can see how the market reacted to it
but if this is a sell position, what the market need to do, as how i see it, we need to break below 6 6976 to create a lower low, and then potentially see where the market can create the lower high
but we need to break these levels first of all before we do anything
so we need to break the support to create the lower law, and then potentially the market will create a lower a lower high, and then we sell
or i, because i'm no financial advisor, remo said, why do you draw lines on the charts? so we have someone that trying to make try to be fun
let's see, like, i see what if someone's rude or not? remo said, and then he wants me to look at coins
you know, you can't, you can't be rude and then expect me to look at your points
what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna drag a fibonacci from one one point nine thousand, nine hundred and fifty back down to the low at one point one hundred and forty two
so i'm gonna just change my my fibonacci to one point eight thousand seven hundred and twenty instead
and this is how you can see, the fifty percent is very respected, right? you saw the market came back up exactly to that level, perfectly
we take the support trendline, connect the dots, the last higher low, 13 840
how are ya? if we break it, create a lower low, that gives us the opportunity to use the fibonacci again, from that last high to the new lower low
and then the new fibonacci will give us potentially lower highest levels
um, but i don't have any targets right now, because we need to see if the market will respect these levels, or you just might see, hey, or you just might see the market push back up again to potentially one point, five thousand seven hundred hundred and five thousand seven hundred and ninety five
and then, i mean, you just might see the market be a little bit more slow, and then see the break of it
right? so that's what i look at right now when it comes to sand guys
um, if you have not already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so you can help me to grow the channel so we can reach out to more people
i think it's connected to the charger, because the chargers start to to play games with me and my computer
we're just waiting for bitcoin to either come back down and break? um, let's see
i'm going to use this low too, to see, either we wait for the bitcoin to break 29 368 for a potential sale opportunity
going to ethereums the same thing we did break the support trend lines on the lower time frames
what we wait for right now is to see, okay, will we see the market pull back up and retest the support trendline for then see the continuation down? or do you do? do we see the market break above the resistance trend line? and that could potentially take us back up to higher targets? i did explain everything in the beginning of this live stream, so, um, you can just go back to it
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
um, you will have the link to that chat in just a few seconds
in that chat, you can have direct contact with me and with all of the other beautiful members in that community
the only thing that we do is that we show each other respect and we share our journeys together, or we i mean, the whole point is that we want to learn how to trade right
and that's why i created this community together with you and so many good traders, so many good people
so if you, if you know how to show respect, you are more than welcome to be part of that
because remember that everyone sees the market in a different way, and we are in different levels when it comes to trading
don't forget that on bitcoin census we do have multiple different social medias
we have tiktok, we have twitter, we have facebook, we have, uh, tele uh, we have instagram
so follow us on the social medias, because we always have daily updates
my name is josh, and in the shorter term, the stock market is playing out some bullish price action, which has helped bitcoin avoid a break to the downside, at least for now
just giving you a really quick update on the daily bitcoin chart and also the twoday bitcoin chart, just to let you know that we still have these active bullish divergences in play, which basically means we have a lack in bearish momentum after that extremely bearish move we saw a few weeks ago
and so, as the subscribers would already know by now, i'm mostly expecting sideways, choppy price action in the shorter term, talking about the next few days or so at least
but i'm also keeping an eye on this ascending line of support in the daily rsi, because if the rsi breaks below that line of support, then that would essentially invalidate this bullish divergence pattern, which means we could resume with some more bearish press action
but as of right now, at the time of recording this video, that has not happened
and when you zoom into the four hour bitcoin charts, obviously, the bitcoin price is still chopping around in this sideways price range, which has been a pretty good opportunity to trade if you've been longing support and shorting resistance
and over the past couple of weeks, the bitcoin price has found a lot of support at around 28 and a half thousand and resistance at around 307 k but as i mentioned in my last video that i posted yesterday on the channel, we also need to keep an eye on this possible descending triangle pattern that is technically forming right now
because here on the four hour time frame, we do have a lower high structure in play, and we also have horizontal lows, relatively speaking, and technically speaking, this type of price structure is bearish because it shows us that the selling pressure is increasing while the buying pressure is remaining stagnant
and so more often than not, this type of pattern does end up breaking to the downside
it's just more likely for it to break to the downside, if that makes sense
but either way, in order to confirm the price target for this pattern, we need to break above resistance or below support
and this line of resistance is coming into play at around 30 000 per bitcoin
and this line of support is coming in at around twenty eight and a half thousand, approximately
and if the price of bitcoin does end up breaking below around twenty eight and a half thousand, then that would give us a technical price target down towards around twenty five to twenty six thousand
so basically, the price of bitcoin could revisit those lows that we set a couple weeks ago if we see a confirmed break below around 28 and a half thousand
but if we see a confirmed breakout above 30 000, and ideally i'd like to see a break above this level of resistance at around 307 k
but if the price of bitcoin does end up breaking above those important points of resistance, then that will give us a technical price target at around 33 000
and if you're looking at the nasdaq 100 index on the four hour time frame, obviously we have this bullish divergence that i've been talking about for a few days now
and over the past few days, we've seen bullish price action in the short term
after seeing that bullish divergence, as expected, and the fact that the stock market is in the green today, that basically saved the bitcoin price, potentially, from breaking down here
we just got one big wick to the downside and came straight back into this pattern
so obviously it would be a good thing for the price of bitcoin if we see more bullish price action play out in the stock markets
but something important to mention about this bullish divergence is the fact that this is only on the fourhour time frame
and if you're looking at the last bullish divergence we saw on the fourhour time frame, that was right back here at the end of april, early may
and that bullish divergence only played out for just a few days before the downtrend was resumed later on
so that is definitely something to keep in mind moving forward
because even though we're playing out some bullish price action right now, in the shorter term, we still have a lot of work to do before we can call this a bullish trend reversal, because it's simply not that at the moment
but something very interesting is, if you zoom out to the weekly time frame for the nasdaq 100 index, we've got this bounce this week right after the rsi entered into oversold territories on the weekly time frame, which is actually a very rare signal for the stock market
if you're looking at the last time that happens, that was back in the march 2020 crash
and if you look at where the weekly rsi got down towards oversold territories, it was basically the very next week where we bottomed out and started the uptrend again
and at the time of recording this video, that is pretty similar to what we're seeing right now, because obviously this week's weekly candle is a green candle for the stock markets
and it was only last week where we saw the weekly rsi enter into oversold territories for the first time since early 2020, once again
dollar currency index, on the weekly time frame, we are still seeing a significant rejection from this range of resistance in the dxy
and if this rejection continues into a further downtrend, this could be a very bullish signal for bitcoin and the stock market
because some of the biggest gains in the price of bitcoin that we've seen over the past five years or so were back during 2017, which was this time period right here, and 2020, entering into early 2021, which was this time period right here
dollar currency index start a significant downtrend, that is an extremely bullish signal for bitcoin
so the fact that we have now seen two solid weeks of red in the us
dollar currency index, this is starting to look like a good signal for bitcoin
dollar currency index, and of course, i'll update you if anything changes here in these videos
and make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen if you want to know how to keep making money in crypto, even if prices are going down
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
and in this video, i wanted to take a look at bitcoin from a longterm perspective
so i wanted to briefly take a look at each cycle, so the one from 2011, 2013, 2017 and the current one, and compare the similarities between them and what we can likely look out for over the next upcoming months for bitcoin if we do end up experiencing a bearish cycle

and that's also where i provide indepth private live streams multiple times per week and much more
if we take a look at each bitcoin cycle that we had previously experienced, but then what you can notice is that this curve would represent bitcoin's logarithmic regression curve
and i understand this is a concept that was discussed by many bitcoin analysts already on the internet
so i didn't create this, but it can show us a perspective of how through each bitcoin cycle, each cycle starts to flatten out
and that's obviously due to the fact that because more liquidity is needed, right? more money is needed to get poured into bitcoin in order to push the price action higher
so initially, when bitcoin was priced at a penny, right? to push bitcoin from a penny all the way up to, let's say, 10, that did not require as much money as pushing bitcoin from four thousand dollars all the way up to, let's say, sixty thousand dollars, uh, last year
more liquidity is needed in order to push the price action higher, and that's why the market cap grows
but regardless, even if we do have institutional adoption, this is an exponential curve that slowly starts to flatten out
and so that in itself, ties into different theories for bitcoin about, uh, different models, whether it's lengthening cycles or super cycles, etc
but but the whole point of bringing this up is that if we take a look at the 2011, 2013 and 2017 bull run for bitcoin, then what we'll notice is that if we take a look at each significant, impulsive move that occurred, right? so now i'm going to take out the fibonacci tool
if we measure from the low of 2010, so this is october 2010, up to the alltime high of 2011
and extend this to the right, then we can see that during this monthly impulsive move, during the first cycle, we had a correction that dropped down close to about 35 for bitcoin
so so comparing this entire bull run that we had the bearish cycle, despite the bearish cycle crashing over 90 percent, i believe, it crashed about 95 percent
uh, from this price of roughly 30, from this price of roughly 30 down to the low of two dollars, despite that being a 95 drop
by comparing this impulsive move to this corrective wave, we can see that it dropped about 35 percent
so we basically retraced about 35 of this entire bullish impulsive move
now if we move on to the next cycle, so i'm going to start the next impulsive move
since we are on the weekly chart, technically on the monthly chart, this would start at the low of the 2011 cycle, right? so right after the crash
so if i measure the next impulsive move, so the bottom of 2011's crash
so if that starts from this low all the way up to the high of december of 2013
and if i measure from that high down to the next low for bitcoin, then this is where we corrected a little bit over 30, right? so the last one was a 35 correction
now if we look at the next cycle, and we repeat the same thing for 2017, then we can see how this also corrected roughly 35
it was actually a little bit over 35, so we could round this down to 37, 38
so this is where bitcoin dropped from the high of close to twenty thousand down to this low of, uh, slightly above three thousand dollars
and so if we project this forward for bitcoin, and let's imagine that we have topped out for this current cycle, so there's different theories where, let's say that we do stay within this monthly range and the market structure continues to rally, which is definitely possible, then this obviously would completely void the current alltime high
however, one probable scenario is, let's assume that we have topped out at 69 000 for bitcoin
well then if we do the same thing where we measure from the low of 2018
so this is december 2018, that mark that marks the lowest low
if we measure from there all the way up to the alltime high, and extent that to the right, this can give us a projection of how much bitcoin can correct
and so if we recall, right, we roughly corrected 35, and then a 31, and then we corrected 37 or 38
and so if that were to occur for the current cycle of bitcoin, so let's say we are entering a grueling bearish cycle, right? well, then that would put us between the prices
and so you can see, this is where i have the box in the light blue, where the the start of the box would connect all the way to the high of 2017
so if we have a 40 correction, which i think is likely to occur for bitcoin if this bearish momentum continues, well then that again, would push us down to 20 000, which is not unrealistic, looking back at the previous cycles
and now, if we take this one step further, so let's assume that bitcoin just decides to correct five or maybe ten percent more than it did in the previous cycle
because, let's recall 2017 cycle corrected close to 40, which was roughly 10 percent more than 2013, 2014 cycle
well then if we anticipate that bitcoin increases by another five to ten percent, so let's say we correct 45 or 50 percent of the weight, well then that would put bitcoin all the way down to either 17 000 or 14 and a half thousand
and so this type of projection, i don't believe, is entirely unrealistic, especially if we consider the fact that typically these bearish cycles have, uh, were where the price action crashed
they typically would last about, uh, a year or so before we reached the bottom of uh, following every crash, right? so from 2017, from the alltime high of 20 000 down to the lowest point, that roughly lasted about a year
and then if you look back at 2013, so from that high down to the lowest low, this one actually lasted closer to two years, okay? and then 2011 cycle, from the high of that was 30 down to the lowest point, that lasted about half a year
so these, these bearish cycles last anywhere from six months so they've lasted half a year to a year, to even two years in some cases
but but now, if we also combine that with the fact that if we take a look at each having period for bitcoin
so each having period here, i have marked, um every four years or so
reason why i bring this up is because we'll notice that each cycle ended a couple of months prior to the next halving period
so for instance, 2011 cycle ended just a couple of months, roughly a year before the very first halving period for bitcoin
and then 2013 cycle, this, in this case, lasted about also a year apart from one another
it wasn't exactly a year, but this once again a couple of months apart
so from the lowest point of 2013 all the way to the second halving cycle, that roughly lasted a year, meaning that each having period was basically inside of the next bull run
this also occurred basically during the start of 2020's 20 2021's bull run
and once again, if we look at the lowest point and stretch this all the way to the right
in this case, this lasted about a year and a half, so also a couple of months apart from one another
so if we project that, let's assume that from the lowest point for bitcoin, let's assume that bitcoin drops down to fifteen thousand
so worst case scenario, we drop down to around fifty thousand
fifty percent correction of this previous impulsive move, measured from a couple of months back, all the way, well, actually, from a few years back, all the way to the low of 2018
if we work backwards from the fourth halving date, which would occur during march of 2024
working backwards, if we project that this is at least a year, two to a year and a half before the bottom of the current cycle, then this is what it would basically look like, right? so that would project that the bottom for bitcoin would occur towards the end of 2022, right? because that's basically a year and a half from uh spring of 2024
and it's a and if it's a year, that would basically mark the bottom for bitcoin nine months from now
so we can have a scenario where bitcoin pushes down for the remainder of the next couple of months of where we can approach the low
so that would mark the low for bitcoin sometime during q2 or q3 of this year, which, looking at the price action, would not be that unrealistic
so the reason why i bring this up is to just be aware of the fact that a scenario like this can't occur
and of course, history doesn't necessarily need to repeat itself through every cycle
we only have three having periods and three previous cycles to look at, of course
so history doesn't always repeat itself, but it tends to rhyme
so i'm only bringing this up not to scare monger, or say that, of course, it's a guarantee that bitcoin will drop to 15k or lower, but just to give you guys a scenario of what you need to look out for, so prepare for this type of possibility, right? so if bitcoin has already bottomed out, and we end up shooting towards the moon for the remainder of this year, then that's great
you know, i'm obviously happy for those of you that are holding on to this
but if it doesn't, then i don't want you a few months from now to look at this as a period that you weren't prepared for
and not every single bearish cycle is a bad thing, right? this can be a good thing for you
especially if you don't hold a ton of bitcoin, then you can gradually buy it up at a discount
you could either dollar cost average, look to buy every week or every month, which is more of an automated strategy that doesn't involve as much technicals
or you can look at every four to five thousand dollars or so and buy a little bit and and obviously, if you put in the same amount into bitcoin, as the price gets lower, you're gonna get more
so just have this idea open where there is a possibility where over the next upcoming months to perhaps the next year, right? so if we extend to the spring of 2023, well, then that would basically mark close to a year of where we would have more bearish months and more bearish weeks, as opposed to bullish months and bullish weeks
and so yeah, let me know down in the comment section of what you guys think of this, if you agree with my analysis or not
do you believe that we are entering a grueling bear cycle or not? and let me know why

let's take a quick look at the current state of the bitcoin market
so continues to battle around that thirty thousand dollar mark
and uh, in all honesty, not much has changed since the previous video
but i'm going to try and give you a trade idea towards the end of this video, something that for those of you with itchy fingers that are waiting to execute on a particular trade, maybe there is something there for you, but on the high time frame
we pretty much stuck in the same area that we were last week, as well as the week before
the week before was, of course, a lot more volatile, leaving that massive wick behind
so right in the middle of that zone, which would make it a no trade zone for a long term trader
if you're somebody that is a swing trader or an investor, you probably your best position to be in right now is in a cash position, waiting for us to either get towards the top of that box, where you could enter a short position, shorting off of the 21 ema targeting back down to the bottom of the box, or you could be waiting for any sort of wicks into this yellow zone
so what would that zone be? it would fall between 26 000 and as low down as 19 thousand dollars
uh, and still targeting that that mean reversion trade, which ultimately we will eventually pull back into that 21 ema on a weekly time frame
so at the moment, there's not really much to say on the high time frames
so traditional markets, the dollar index, we can see that we've wicked straight into that zone that i mentioned might be a bouncing area
i'll be curious to see if we lose this white line and it is a proper reversal for the dexi, then that could bode well for, of course, the risk on assets
however, if you want my personal bias, i am leaning towards this is most likely just going to be sitting in a higher low excuse me? i mean, yes, a higher low and then carrying on towards the upside
if you look at the stock markets, we can see the stock markets really have been getting crushed
it is bouncing slightly off of that level, but anything that's below this 313, i would assume, is probably going to be sitting in the lower high
almost made it to the key quarterly, but still bouncing just before that zone
at the end of the day, i'm still targeting, longer term, those precovered levels
so just before we had the covert dump, i'm expecting price eventually to pull back down towards these zones
know that it could be tough out there in the crypto market, realistically, for the next couple of months
let's go on to this chart, which is the one day bitcoin chart
try to get a couple of times above that 9 ema on the daily chart
so, uh, when this starts to happen, the tighter and tighter they get, that indicates consolidation
and then there will be an expansion off of that consolidation, which will likely lead to the next big move
the longer that you go sideways, the bigger the potential for the following, uh, breakout or breakdown will be
so where are we on the fourhour chart? we stuck, still within that consolidation
it's been a long time since the 11th of may, so it's been pretty much two weeks that we've just been chopping in and out
and the only guys that would likely be making money in this zone would be the range traders
so i always recommend that when a market is not trending, then it's going to be arranging
so try find that range and play that range with short time frame sculpts
now, for something like this, you'll most likely need to use leverage, and i've got it on the 15minute chart over here for you
if you take your 15minute chart and just have the normal candlesticks, then use a parallel channel and set that up over there with the most touch points, that the most wicks that touch that area, would be the top of that range
and then the most touch points on the bottom would be, of course, the bottom of the range
when you get to the bottom of the range, you can buy, of course, control your position size
you're not going in with your whole portfolio, but a small percentage, maybe one percent, maybe two percent, of your portfolio, using leverage, so a position that you would be willing to lose
and targeting your first take profit would be the mid range over there
so you've already, if you had long from the bottom over here, you'll take your first profit midrange
it's coming back, testing again if it manages to hold this as a sr flip
then you can now target the top of the range and then again, rinse and repeat until we break this range
so for updates on exactly what i'm doing, i probably will actually start taking some leverage trades
when we do get either to the top or the bottom of this, i will update you around that on my twitter
you can also see a card that will pop up, and you can follow me over there
hit the bell notification if you want to be notified of when the next video is up
eventually there will be a big move, and will be right there ready to capitalize on that move
so we've got two big point of controls right here that should be holding our support
so if the price of bitcoin does come down to 29 350, i expect a potential shortterm bounce from this level, at least to the 618 from this drop
and there you have the bitcoin price getting that bounce from that huge point of control of the 29 300 range, already hitting that take profit
and of course, we're going to just take a look at the one hourly to take a look at the most important levels where we could potentially find trading opportunities in the next coming days

welcome back to another episode of bitcoin sensors news channel
i am not a financial advisor, and i want to quickly remind that if this video gets over 2 000 likes and you comment down below, you are eligible for a giveaway in bitcoin
the scenario that we talked about today, this morning on the live stream, was potential day trader, potential scalp opportunity, because we are range trading in between thirty thousand six hundred and twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars
we're doing range trading, and what we did spot today is that potential retracement, okay, on the bitcoin price to that 29 300 area
looking at the point of control from each every day, we can see here, on the 21st and also on the 24th, we had a major, major, big level, as you can see with this red horizontal line
and this was also hitting that 50 618 fibonacci from the lows to the highs
and we talked about also the take profit area, hitting that 618 level from the high to the lows
i am protected inside of my position here, just in case the bitcoin price does have another leg up, all right? but totally protected, already taking profits
and this is the beauty about taking a look at these major levels
remember, for all of those experienced traders, on buybit, my favorite swing trading platform, you get up to 4050 with the bonus

primix bt, my favorite for day trading up to 7 000 with a bonus
i've got four video tutorials down below in the description, also, of these platforms
okay? wanna break out from this zone, or break down from this major support level? and what we've been talking about, okay, for the last few days
i'm going to repeat it again, because it's a super important range
and if i take a look at the vpvr, we got the value area high, like i mentioned, from the volume traded right over here
uh, for the last 15, 16 days, it's right over here at the 31 800, we got that major weekly level
if we go back here to the one hourly chart, we can see it has been major resistant zone as soon as we broke down below this range
so a potential rejection here at that 318 or even 32 000 area
i am expecting a potential rejection if we do start consolidating, because you could have a big, major pump, and, you know, see the price just absolutely blast through this range
i am interested in trading, you know, the potential consolidation here for, uh, potential rejection and continuation to the downside in this huge, big macro trend
now, what would be the bearish case scenario? in the short term bullish one? well, if we do start rolling down from this level, break the support range, okay? at the 28 600, we've been talking about this for the last few days
there's going to be shortterm trading opportunities where you will get a potential big bounce here from the value area
and here's the level that i am waiting for, a potential double bottom
this is a major, major level, okay? as you can see, it's the four hourly close and open that we did have on the 12th of may, right over here, just round about that 276 k range
and if we take a look at fib levels from the low to the high, this peak over here, it is round about that 618 financial retracement, as you can see, the 276 so it's super important level
i do expect if the b2c price does come down there, we're going to see some volatility and a big potential bounce to this range over here, where we could be getting rejection
you just need to pay attention to the chart and find out about these levels
and the potential projected move of a channel breakout is the width of the channel
so you can speculate that from the width of the channel, from the breakdown, you could see some volatility, even hitting 27 000, all right? to a major wick, looking for that double bottom, getting that resistance, getting that support from 276, but can come as low as 27 000
we're looking for that 322, approximately where we are going to hit the wicks, okay, from this major resistance
and then if we start getting below this range and getting that volatility, this is what i'm expecting, a potential rejection after potentially hitting that 322

[Music], what's up the legends? how is everyone doing? hope you're having a fantastic wednesday today
where do we have our major, big opportunities? is what you want to know, of course
make sure to smash up that like button, all of you guys that are in here right now, all together, let's make it to 100 likes in just 10 seconds
all together, right now at this moment, smash up the like button, and let's dive in here, straight into the bitcoin price
we can take a look at all coins, of course, but i want to know what bitcoin is doing
i want to know the major levels that we could find opportunities on bitcoin
and short term, very, very short term scenario here on bitcoin
okay? we do know that this is the most important resistance level
which one? the thirty thousand five hundred dollars? let's keep it clear
this is the most important, closest resistance level that bitcoin has
okay? this is, you know, this is, you can see it on the chart
all right, for the last, you know, 10 to 15 days, as you can see on the chart
which is the most important support level? let me know guys in the comment section
now, which one is the most important support level? let me know guys in the comment section
the 30, 500, 330, 600 is the most important resistance, which is the most important support level that we do have for bitcoin, the closest one that we need to break, the one that is holding now
okay, let me know, and i guess a lot of you are going to already know this, it is the 28 600
it is this one right over here, where we have been bouncing every single time
i did take some profits, but i did a long trade here that i did explain in yesterday's video
we had a swing failure pattern, beautiful swing failure pattern on the four hourly
on the one hourly, i prefer taking a look at them on the one hourly, of course
and, um, yeah, basically, um, there is a possibility that we might attempt and break this resistance, might get rejected, who knows
as you can see, been such a long time, and we are actually creating, you know, a slightly lower high here
and it is, it is just about to make a breakout in a direction
so where do you think the price is going to go? up or down? up or down
like i explained also on yesterday's video, if we do break the 2000, uh, the 28 600, okay, to the downside, the value area low, it is very likely going to get at least one bounce, okay? it's very, very likely
who knows, it might be a massive, big fake out and you have a vshaped recovery
we, you know, this is why we're going to be conservative in our trading
but i do see at least one quick bounce here, okay, one quick rejection from this range
if we have a big, successful breakout, if we do successfully break this resistance also, then, of course, i am seeing rejection here slightly below the 32 000 range
and if we do come down, i do see a potential quick bounce from this level
it can be day trading, or even scalping, it might be very quick
and i'm going to use, potentially four or five percent, no, not that much, but three percent on my capital for this trade, because i haven't done hardly any trading this week
i just traded bitcoin, uh, for the last, you know, six, seven days, this trade yesterday, which was, you know, getting into that swing failure
just not feeling confident here, not seeing any opportunities
range trading is full of opportunities, uh? but, yeah, i just, i was looking for that breakout, looking for the safe bet
and, yeah, you could about, you could have got into the all of these um balances in resistance and support, right? you can see it on the chart
let's take a look at the comment section right away, because it's time to say, hello
are we gonna have, you know, a major, big bounce here on the dxy in the next coming days, couple of weeks, or are we going to continue to the downside? well, we are basically hitting major fib level from this low consolidation
so if we take a look at fib level from this low to the high, we're basically touching the 618 right over here, as you can see
so this is why we are getting also this major balance, important fib level
are we going to get a major bounce here, and then potentially get rejection and continue back down
this is the thing, guys, this would be the ideal scenario for bitcoin
if you checked out yesterday's video, let me know what do you think
i will ask another poll today on which all coin you want me to take a look at
with bitcoin and with yesterday's analysis, i take, uh, did take a look, a full look on v chain, explaining how v chain, okay, it's in a big, massive downtrend
we're talking about elliott wave theory, fibonacci time, all right
and explaining, you, with fibonacci time, how we usually bottom out in between the 1 to 1618 time extension
all right, on the wave, on the corrective wave, and all of this is one wave, where we do have five waves inside of one wave, okay? and explaining how the corrective wave, you know, it still hasn't finished
it might maybe finish in between november and, yeah, about from november 22 to november 20
i do explain why, uh, we could be bottoming out right over here on v chain
it's an incredible project, and why the big, big, major run will be in between the sum of 2024 and the sum of 2025
and you can see here the five waves, and we are inside of this corrective wave
it's gonna probably take longer than people think, and it's just going to be like that
and i think v chain is one of those projects that will rise, okay, in the next run, because it does have insane technology, technology um for supply tracking
if you haven't checked out the video, it is, you know, from minute 14 or something like that
i did a long video, 20 minutes, if you just want to check out this guys
hello, crypto legends, mark dutch, how are you doing? um, andy for the win
i got mark dutch here, my mods here, giving fire to the community
you know, who knows? if it's upwards, i think i'm going to be bearish
it is very, very likely to to potentially create a kind of a swing failure pattern and then have a big, massive drop
i did explain this all right on one of my latest videos, can't remember, or in a live stream
we were range trading for about 15, 16 days, as you can see, all right, you know, from the 5th of december to about the 20th, 22nd, 23rd
and you know, what you do have is a big, large consolidation after a big, massive drop
you start seeing some bullishness, because you start breaking above the last lower highs
and what happens? you come here to the first lower high from the drop, and you basically have a massive swing failure pattern over here, slightly getting above this range, double top scenario
look how beautifully you bounce, once at least, from this last lower high, major resistance, as you can see, as support
and i think this is something that could happen very, very likely
i remember a lot of people becoming a very bullish with this kind of price action, you know, looking for for much higher levels
and, you know, just if i zoom in here, very, very similar scenario could happen, all right, where we have this first lower high from the insane drop, and where we could be breaking these major resistance levels
so potentially looking for that pump here, getting that rejection from this weekly level, this big consolidation
if we do pump to 32 000 range and we consolidate, i'm shorting
you know, you cannot, you can just not ignore this level, all right? and if we do pump there, and we do consolidate, i'm, i'm, i'm shorting
if we start doing this price action over here, is when i will short because we could pump here
we could pump, and we can absolutely slice through this range
and, you know, i know a lot of people potentially will short it
you know, we'll short it, just trying to catch the best price level
i want to get into the consolidation, just like i got into the consolidation yesterday
i entered right over here, after seeing the confirmation, after seeing the swing failure pattern right over here
i did take some of that, those profits right over here on this wick, on the way up
uh, best thing that i can do here is set off, okay, some alarms
you go here on on trading view, and this is, you know, the best thing you could do is set off some alarms right over here, alert
once you get that message on your phone, then you come to the charts, and you sit for, you know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, you analyze the situation, uh, then you if it's boring, then you come back in another 30 minutes
and this is where you, you potentially can see some some opportunities
i haven't been trading bitcoin for the last few days, and the only trade that i took last few days was this one right over here from yesterday
um, i looked, but it was pretty confident on that, on that trade
so let me, just before i go through the comment section, guys, an insane good tool here to use in the immediate short term, of course, is the of, um, the volume pro the volume profile
svp, as you can see here, when i get this tool out, uh, it's hang on one second
what this tells you is the biggest point of control from each day, every single day
this is the one hourly chart, okay? and this is showing me the biggest point of control from every single day
biggest point of control is here, the 23rd of may, because control, uh, biggest point of control is here
so what i can see on this, on this range, okay, you usually do get some potential bounces from this level
and what i do like is that the biggest point of control from the 21st of may is right over here at the 29 385
we've got also this one right over here, um, at the exact same level from the 24th of may
so we've got two big point of controls right here that should be holding our support
so if the price of bitcoin does come down to 29 350, i expect a potential shortterm bounce from this level, at least to the 618 from this drop
okay, so you could do something like this, but at least one quick bounce where you could get a good opportunity
so this is what i i can, you know, just a quick opportunity that you just, i wanted to point out there
let's go through the comment section right away, see what's going on
some aussies, people from australia, new zealand, absolutely phenomenal
absolutely accumulate bitcoin as much as you can for the next coming years
the first time i bought beat bitcoin was back in 2018, when it was at 6 000
then, of course, we did have the december drop that went almost to three thousand dollars
i was fifty percent down just a few months, uh, invested in crypto
you're not always going to buy and be in a profit in the next coming months
well, i can see this one, the one that we have been bouncing, the 28 600 range
this is the the closest, biggest support where we did we are getting those bounces every single time
let's take a look at gmt, of course, here for hdhd, absolutely
what's going on with gmt? uh, let's go to the four hourly chart
if you ask me, okay, this symmetrical triangle broke to the downside
if you do ask me, i think, you know, this has a higher probability and actually continuing down
all right, we do have a descending triangle scenario, because we have been bouncing here at the exact, exact same level of support, the 125 look at gmt on the four hourly what? support? support, support
mean, well, basically, here, in a nutshell, it means that there is more selling pressure than buying pressure
the buying pressure is really, really weak at that 125, and the selling pressure is gaining momentum
this is why you are creating these lower highs, meaning that there will be a point where the selling pressure should be gaining the buying pressure, finally breaking that major support
so if we're looking at probabilities, looking at the chart sentiment, um, yeah, it does look like that we have a higher probability on gmt to break support and come down to retest, you know, this 90 cent one dollar level
took profits a little too early, but i was happy enough, um, to take those profits
and, yeah, by the looks of things, it looks like that gmt could, could be breaking support level in the next coming days here, giving us that fall
all right, we got the the textbook, you know, potential projected move from this selling pressure
and, yeah, we are looking for a potential retest of the lows here, for a potential double bottom consolidation and continuation to the downside
probabilities are saying that there's a higher chance in breaking support here on gmt
if we do break support, okay, successfully, we and we do have a little bit of a of a bounce here
there could be a nice opportunity here in to get into a short for confirmation
i think, a potential another bounce, touching this major level at 80 cents
okay? if we do come down to 80 cents, i think that one bounce is very likely before you you potentially break down
okay, so, um, yeah, this is the thing potentially look at, you know, looking for that inverted cup and handle scenario, right? this is why, this is why this usually happens
you do get, um, you know, at least one test more, and then the third test, you might potentially break it
but one more balance, because just because it's a very, very strong level, big consolidation that happened in march, very likely it's gonna hold for at least one more bounce, if we do go down to that range
so, yeah, probability is saying that this is maybe going to break to the downside
there's a 60 percent more probability here in actually breaking down from this range
knc, what's going on with knc, kyber network, absolutely insane this one
i mean, we did, i did a bad, a bad call on this, but i actually got into a trade and got stopped out at breakeven
there was an insane level on kyber network here the entire, you know, not entire but about, what, eight months of 2021, where you were bouncing from support and resistance every single time here on the chart
what happened here? this red box that i do have, so if i go to the four hourly, i shorted that range here, just there
once i was in pretty nice profits, i thought, i thought, okay, with my analysis, of course, it's not always, you know, 100 percent, that we were going to come down at least to this range, to this range where we do have a lot of resistance
okay? uh, shorted here, put my stop los stop loss at break even
what happened? we kind of created a small double bottom, got stopped out at breakeven
but something extraordinary that what happened here on cyber network
i mean, this is already, this is hitting that resistance right now and getting rejected
so, you know, potentially this is going to roll down from this range
it would have been ideal to get to the 240 on kyber network, right over here
but first of all, you know, i was too blinded with me getting stopped out at break even, thinking, okay, we are pumping, you know, this might continue to the upside
but just focusing too much on this, what i found out is that was a, there was a big other opportunity right here, where just at the 290 level
this was a big support level here back in april, march and april, as you can see, a big support level
and if i do zoom out, okay, let's go to the two hourly chart here
um, we did actually hit the 382 from the drop, okay? as you can see here on the chart, from the actual drop of the highs on kyber network of april to the lows, you're hitting that 382 fibonacci
okay? these three levels, 382, 05 and 618, are the most important fib levels
and of course, if you do add confluence, you got the 382, you got a big, major support level
got stopped out, then i, you know, moved on into another altcoin or or bitcoin
but, yeah, it was a very, it was a good shorting opportunity, you know, at least to take profits to the big support level here at the 240
so as let's zoom in here, and if you break out this this major support range
okay? so if you did short here, let's just say you shorted here, and insanely enough, you came all the way down, you know, that was a take profit range
if you entered here a take profit one level is here at the 240 range
why is it to take profit range? because you're very likely going to get a bounce
you do not know if there's, there's if there's going to be an insane bounce, and you're going to continue to the upside
and what is happening right now is that, you, you know, you've got that one bounce
you created a lower high, so you are seeing weakness already on the price action
we broke down this huge, huge level of support that has acted as resistance
ideal scenario right now, ideal scenario would be coming back up again, or a retest at this range, creating a slightly high high, and failing, basically creating a swing failure pattern for continuation to the downside
so i'm going to set my alarms here, also for kyber, because i really like this potential setup
add an alarm right there, so i can get a message, i can get an email on my phone, you know
and once that happens, i will be focusing on kyber, see if we're gonna actually get a rejection, see if we actually gonna fail this range, jump into a trade, jump into a trade, looking for this, looking for this right over here
so what i want to see is, bang, bang, here, and then jump into a trade, swing failure pattern
i want to take a look at fib levels from the highs to the lows
we actually touched the 50 fibonacci to perfection, right there
50 fibonacci from the highs created on the 20th of may to the lows created yesterday
where did we come up to the 50 fibonacci? to the exact scent here, to the exact scent, the exact exact sense
so, you know, whoever says that fibonacci, you know, levels doesn't work, well if, yeah, you haven't actually um traded it or or back tested it
of course, quick short position, where to where? at least two, round about that, six, one, eight fib or fifty percent
looking at kyber network, at that 247 cents, big level, getting that rejection 50, big level
so, yeah, and where? where? we actually stopping right now is is at the 50 percent, from the low to the highs, you're actually stopping at that 50 percent
this is all we're already a good take profit area, in my opinion
you know, if you are trading, then you are, you know, a lot of people aiming for the lows
start as soon as we're getting a consolidation at these fib levels
uh, take profits just in case you can get that free ride to the downside
um, the best way i've been trading for the last few months is, you know, take profits early
millionaires have been made by buying low and selling too soon
uh, not like people that never sell, right? let's take a look at, uh, victor here
something good about cadena is that we do have a nice, nice level here
we do have a nice level on cadena, which is at the one dollar
yeah, this this range, basically, this range in between 140, 140 and 220
why is it a big range? we've been consolidating here between september and almost end of october
and this is a level where we could, you know, consolidate for quite a few months on cadena before we potentially bottom out
this big, big range, as you can see on the vpvr, uh, if we do see cadena having a rally in the next coming weeks, um, yeah, i think it's going to be very bearish
in my personal opinion, it's going to be too soon for a lot of the altcoins and bitcoin to recover and go to alltime highs and and, you know, things like that
i think we're just going to create another lower high if we do see, if we do see a rally in the coming weeks, and then some more downside
and there is where we look in the potential double bottom, sideways action, you know, by the end of the 2022, where where a lot of the cryptos might be bottoming out there
it doesn't mean bottoming out that you are going to pump in the next few weeks
if you could bottom out in 2022 and retest that bottom in late 2023, after a year
zoom in a little bit and and check out the situation on cadena
if we do get that big relief rally all the way up here to the 440 cents, it's a big, major level
first major level here, of course, is this high over here, this range
it would be my first level on cadena, the three dollar 40 cents
yeah, major zone where we could find some big opportunities on on canada
there will be some bounces in between these ranges, very, very lightly
reason why is because we do, we are creating lower highs right there
and i do see cadena coming to to, potentially the lower levels, almost to retest these lows
then potentially you might be creating a double bottom, a slightly higher low here
you know, we did have these levels marked up on cadena, where we, where we did get this, you know, this breakdown
we were getting this rejection from this range, from this major, solid level
reason why is because from the ultimate low bottom here, we've had like this one wave, second, three and then four, and then, you know, this fifth wave attempt has absolutely failed
broken down, broken down this these lows over here, broken there, the uptrend, and now getting this kind of abc correction
and c correction hasn't just ended yet, by the looks of things
so getting that one, two, three, and, i mean, the c correction could end up at this range
so, yeah, you are potentially looking for for this level here to hold nicely
yeah, the value area, low value area, low from this range is holding pretty nice
and this is the range where we actually have this consolidation, and we are getting this support
but, you know, best scenarios here on on, on cadena, if you are looking to to trade, to scalp, to day trade on cadena
uh, we got this level at the 280 being a big, big resistance level
so if you do get that double bottom scenario, if this does happen and you break through this range, this is going to be big resistance
the 24 80, 340, 280 is very good levels for some potential bounces
so you are looking for that breakup, and you got major levels for bouncing here
so, yeah, that is my take on cadena here, looking at potential scalping day trade opportunities
and i do do get a small commission but you get the best bonus available that there is out there
if you sign up with my link in the description, you've also got primex bt, my favorite day trading platform
you can trade oil, you can trade gold, you can trade s p 500, nasdaq, dow jones
and you're using bitcoin, you or ethereum or stable coins as collateral
and you do get seven percent added to your initial deposit, seven percent
you deposit a thousand dollars, you're getting seventy dollars on top of that, thousand dollars to trade with
of course, it's both of these platforms are the ones that i mostly use
and also, this is also good for me, because i do get a small commission
and it does want me to make to continue with doing technical analysis here on youtube, of course
can we have a look? let's say, let's take a look at the comment section
emil, can we have a look at dot and link and what levels? uh, to consider we're going to revisit for accumulating
something very interesting to see on polka dot is that, you know, when polka dot was launched, okay, back in 2020, the price of polka dot, you know, was ranging in between three, four, five dollars
so, you know, is it possible to go down initial price? okay, of course it is, because, you know, there's private sales and all of the rest of it
but it's basically, in my opinion, polka dot is not going to go much lower than, uh, then this, you know, seven, six dollar range
not saying it is at the bottom, but, yeah, round about the five dollars
if we do see polka dot at five dollars, it was trading at around about five dollars in between set august, sorry, in between august of 2020, till december
so it's over four months trading around about the five dollar range
okay, this is something important to note, because this is when, you when you got a question on of where is this crypto going to bottom out? you know, polkadot being one of the, you know, king l1 projects that i thought it was going to perform much better, but i think it's going to be one of those projects that will thrive, of course, in the next bull run, in the next coming years, polkadot will be one of those cryptos that will be breaking alltime high, in my personal opinion, here at the 55 range, and potentially reaching 100
it's the one of the most important air ones, okay, most developed that is, you know, very likely going to success in the next run
so you're thinking, where could this bottom out? where is a good accumulation zone, of course
where is it? where is it a good accumulation? a good accumulation here on on? uh, polka dot is already this range
okay? we do see bitcoin having a drop, if we do see polka dot dropping below seven dollars, it is already going to be, you know, an insane accumulation area, uh, the five dollar range
and the biggest volume, guess where it is? in between three dollars and six dollars
so if polka dot were to be trading at that range in the coming weeks, i'm not sure if we will, but if we do, it is very likely just gonna go sideways, have some little pump relief rallies, sideways, go back down to five dollars
it's gonna take a long, long time for polka dot to recover from this range
now, what we are looking for is, you know, a lot of kryptos, bitcoin, you know, to be bottoming out by the end of 2022
in my personal opinion, looking at fibonacci time, is where the cryptos should be finding a bottom
of course, make sure to subscribe, because i will be explaining how we could very likely bottom out at that range
now, this doesn't mean that from that left, from end of 2022, we're going to skyrocket in 2023
if we have a recession, black swan event, we'll also be seeing major wicks, potentially dropping below the actual bottom
this is also what happened back in 2020, where we had the march 2020 black swan event
but this is why you always need some dry powder to try and get into these major, big events
where does chain link have the biggest accumulation volume, reaccumulation volume, it is right over here, in between the two dollars and the um five dollar mark
look at the value area high right over here from this big, big mountain
very likely that we're not going to break successfully below this range
uh, we might be just going sideways, you know, in between four or five dollars on chain link for many, many months
uh, just like what happened over here, right? basically, you range trading for months
so, you you know, what is this about? six, seven, uh, eight months
you do see your pumps, your dumps, but, yeah, you know, we have created a massive, big volume range, looking at the vpvr
all right? and for the next coming months, you are going to see, you know, i don't see chain links successfully breaking down five dollars
could we hit four dollars? yeah, of course we could hit four dollars, um but we're not going to go much, much lower than that range
i will be picking up some more chain link at those price levels
i mean, funny thing, because, you know, you want to know, i'm, i've been in crypto since 2018
and first, um, you know, chain that i started buying was at the one dollar 16 cents, okay, around that range is when i was starting buying chain link
so, and, yeah, i'm telling you, this is not, uh, it's not a few thousand dollars
i promised myself, i didn't, i'm not gonna sell any chain link till it hits a hundred dollars, not a single one
i got somebody in the comment section, you know, accumulation zone for polka dot, of course
we've got the biggest accumulation zone in between three dollars and five dollars here on chain link
this is a big, major level where, very likely, the price will not fall below this range successfully
if you're looking for that sideways, boring action, this will be the accumulation zone
could you get some relief rallies here in the immediate short term, hitting 10 12? yes
very likely it's gonna be boring action for the next coming months
this is the time that most of the people, you can see on youtube, people are losing interest, people, you know, or many other, uh, other other youtube channels
also, you can see on google, uh, you can see, um, you know, the interest is disappearing
people not searching for bitcoin, but people are not searching for crypto
this is the recipe, this is the recipe of accumulation, people losing interest
and then people, you know, will gain interest once we have that big, massive rally, big, massive run
i bet a lot of you watching this today has got into crypto in between 2021 and 2022, right? let me know, guys
i want to know this, because this is a great question here for the poll
okay, did you get into crypto in 2021? 2022? let me know, guys
i would say, i would say at least 50 percent of you guys, did you get into crypto in 2021, 2022? let me know, guys in the poll
sure that 50, at least 50 of people got into crypto in 2021, 2022, um, and the best moment to get into crypto will be, you know, is 2022 and 2023
so, yeah, out of 47, we've already got half of that, almost 25 people, about 25 people getting into crypto in 2021, in 2022
right moment is going to be 2022, 2023 and even yeah, well, basically now, you know, basically now you've already had a big, massive correction
so, yeah, this is the start of getting into crypto, 2022, 2023, you know, even 2024, part of 2024
but, yeah, 2024, you're already going to be late if you want to start accumulating, because, yeah, get ready, because there's going to be fireworks
um, so, yeah, best moment is gonna be in between this year and 2024
i remember, you know, getting my mom, i got my mum to buy one whole bitcoin when it was at ten thousand dollars
and, yeah, yeah, i don't know, i don't know, just just buy it
and, yeah, she, she, she actually got an initial investment out, and she's got some pretty nice profits still, were there on the sidelines
how about having a look at bitcoin dominance? i got a lot of popcorn here
so straight here, i think chain link will enter an insane accumulation zone in between three dollars and, you know, basically now, three dollars, six dollars
it's already inside an accumulation zone it will be going sideways in between these ranges
so, yeah, that was the initial question from somebody in the comment section
bitcoin dominance will be interesting, because i did think that, yeah, we're breaking resistance
i was looking at the bitcoin dominance here, and i was wrong, guys
i wasn't wrong, i was totally wrong, because we had this descending triangle here on on, on the bitcoin dominance
and i was, you know, i was thinking that we are potentially going to extend the bull run
uh, actually, this time there's been too big of an ephoria that happened in early 2021, because a lot of people were aiming for the bull run to end in late 2021, um, because of the four year cycle theory
a lot of the cryptos didn't manage to get above the alltime high of april of 2021
it was six to seven months early from the expected fouryear cycle theory
anyway, looking at the bitcoin dominance, we already, you know, showing some strength
what happens in bear markets? in bear markets, bitcoin gains dominance, of course, and all coins get absolutely crushed
so we can clearly see here the bitcoin dominance in january of 2012, sorry, not 2020, um, 2018
january of 2018, right over here is where bitcoin and most all of the altcoins peaked, right? they reached a massive, bigger, fouryear level
what happened in the bear market, uh, part of 2018, 2019, we had a big, massive runup on the bitcoin dominance
so, you know, i'm actually changing my opinion here on the bitcoin dominance, that we are very, very likely going to see bitcoin dominance at around about 55, approximately
um, bitcoin dominance, in my opinion, will never come back up to 73, these highs from the bear market of 2019, 2020, i don't think bitcoin dominance will come back up to 73
the reason why is because there's a lot of altcoins that, there's a lot of projects coming out and, you know, the same reason why, you know, it was bitcoin dominance back in 2016, 2016, this is only, um, six years ago, it was trading at, you know, um, 96 percent
so, yeah, basically all the money that was in the crypto was basically in bitcoin, 96
of course, you start seeing a lot of old coins, you know, a lot of speculation
bitcoin dominance came all the way down here in about, um, less than two years, to 45, you know, losing half of the dominance
you're not going to see the dominance come back up to 90 percent
i see a lot of them gaining a lot of market capitalization, such as ethereum
you know, we could look at ethereum, ethereum's got half of the market capitalization, approximately
you wouldn't even think about ethereum, you know, reaching half
okay, i could be totally wrong with this theory again, but you know, very likely that a lot of the altcoins are going to gain a lot of the money, a lot of the dominance from bitcoin
and you are going to see that in the bear market, of course, the dominance going up or bitcoin
uh? when there is a crypto bear market, what is the safest crypto at this moment? and nothing is safe, it's bitcoin, of course
so when there's a large speculation, people prefer having their their their money right into into bitcoin, uh, till the end of their bear market, and then potentially speculate a lot in in um in in the altcoins
so i do think that we'll be create, we'll be creating a lower high in the next, you know, one to two years on the bitcoin dominance, then to come down for the third time and retest the lows, and potentially break it
and that is when the dominance is going to hit 35, 30 percent
uh, just because there's going to be a huge amount of crypto good, uh, crypto projects
they're going to be a huge amount of good projects out there that we'll be taking um, yeah
very likely to to have a, um, you know, a run to the upside in the next coming months
a lot of all coins were gonna, are gonna absolutely get even even more crushed, all right? than they have
this doesn't mean that they can still drop, you know, much more
so if you got into crypto just two months ago, yeah, get get ready, because it's going to be a a pretty long accumulation zone
all right? you're going to go to, we're going to go to lower levels
we might see, you know, the traditional stock market, s p dow jones, get absolutely crushed and lose 20, 30 of its value, which is absolutely insane for the stock market
and you are going to find an insane opportunity on in accumulating good projects
look, just for those people, you know, it's absolutely insane, because i think a lot of people here watching my channel is, you know, they've invested, you know, when i started investing, or they've invested, you know, from 2019 or 2020 i started investing in crypto, or reading books, the book bitcoin standard
and in 2018, i, i jumped from from stocks into crypto right away after the massive, big bull run
i didn't invest one single um dollar inside of the uh, in the peak, i wanted to learn, i wanted to know about crypto bitcoin
and once i was learning that, you know, in the next few months of of um of 2018, i got into mid 2018
all right? i remember the summer, getting into into bitcoin, you know, buying so accumulating my first bitcoin at the six thousand dollar range
and what happened a few months after that, in december, november, december of 2018, i lost a half percent of what i invested in in bitcoin, some ethereum, i had some xrp also
and i was investing every single month, dollar cost averaging, right? great strategy
i lost half of my money that i've been invested in, you know, for the last few months
what happens afterwards? you have a massive, big run to the upside
what happens after several, several months of 2018, 19, 2020, we have the c19 crash
i lost 60 percent of the value i entered heavily in accumulation
what did i do? i actually was down 60 and what did i do? i got more money out of the bank, and i put some more money
uh, vechain was, was one of my best investments, um, back here
and, yeah, this is the thing, you're in a loss, and, you know, you feel like an idiot, because you're actually down 60 percent on something
and i think, okay, let's get some more money and put it in, because we're down because, yeah, basically you actually understand that this is the moment you need to get in right, when when things get really ugly
remember so much, getting into there and buying crypto there, and and being in a huge loss
you will have maybe a a recession, black swan event here, that he's gonna take bitcoin wicking below twenty thousand dollars, or even twelve thousand dollars
but yeah, if that does happen, if that does happen, it it will be a sign of a potential bottom
um, if you have one of those insane drops, just like we did here back in march of 2020, that in just a couple of weeks, we went here, from trading to from ten thousand dollars all the way down to, um, less than four thousand dollars, losing 60 of its value
i mean, you want to get in, you want to get in heavily on that
so this is the thing, if you do see a kind of relief rally bitcoin trading, you know, 30, 35 000, you lose 60 of your value you go down to, you know, it's 18, 16 000
yeah, that is already going to be good price levels for btc, in my opinion
did you get into crypto in 2021, 2022? we have 60 of people, 59, saying yes
i was, um, working for metalwork back here in, you know, 2019 and 2020
i was putting a few hundred dollars every single month in crypto, a few hundred dollars every single month
but, yeah, those hundred dollars definitely paid out inside of this run
um, even though i um on on chain link and some other cryptos, i didn't take enough profits, uh? it still paid it off
i'm telling you, this is not financial advice, but the next couple of years is going to be a lifetime opportunity to be set off, all right, by 20 between 2024 and 2026
very likely, uh, you know, not financial advisor, of course, everything is risky
and it obviously, you do, you you know, i couldn't believe when bitcoin was breaking alltime high, and it was going, and it was pumping and pumping and hitting thirty thousand, forty thousand dollars, you know, in just a few months after breaking all time high
very very boring, until you finally, you know, start having that that big, massive run to hit alltime highs and breaking it
i'm gonna get a video out, documentary video, you know, comparing the internet bubble with a crypto bubble
the same amount of trillions of dollars were invested now in in crypto than in, uh, in in the dotcom bubble
people rather, you know, go down to the shop and buy a newspaper for 30 cents, instead of waiting one hour to download a file that you can download in a fraction of a second
today, back in those days, all right, in the early 2000s, late 90s, you couldn't download this, you know, this file that you can download in a fraction of a second
today for an hour, you need to wait an hour to to download a piece of newspaper, a piece of news
i'm going to go down and to the shop, okay, and buy it for 30 cents and and forget about of this, of this crap
also, what is the prediction of ada? i am a long trade at the moment
if you're in a long trade position, where did you enter would be my question
this is the level where we do have the biggest point of control, starting from 20 level
this reaccumulation we had in january of 2021, in between 20 cents and 40 cents, is holding very, very nicely
we do have a spike here on the vpvr, exactly at that 36 38 range
um, but if you are in a long position, you want to know short term analysis
i mean, this does, just by looking at the price action, this does look like it's going to roll back down to retest the lows
i mean, if you're lying, all depending on where you're longing, if you're long in here, i think a potential retest at the lows here is very, very possible
you could get that double bottom scenario, but a retest just looks very, very likely
um, by looking at 88, you know, this is just ready to roll down
you are creating those lower highs, as you can see, you know, big, solid level, kind of a descending triangle, like on other cryptos
how long is this? um, 50 cent level going to hold for? how long for stay cautious
um, we are the we are below the biggest point of control, which is at the 53 cent level
you can see here, from alltime high to this one, we actually bouncing from that range as resistance, getting rejection from this lower high range
we are slightly creating higher lows over here, as you can see, on the chart, slightly higher low
so it's forming a huge symmetrical triangle, right? you know, if we do manage to solidly break this level here with a strong daily it's very, very likely going to hold our support in the immediate, short term
but the reason why we are getting resistance here is, you know, look at this large consolidation there on on trx here at the eight, eight, nine cent level
you got the double top swing failure pattern, absolutely beautiful here
okay, right over here, also, textbook technical analysis, target reaching here, the target down below
and what could happen right now? you know, only, if only, if [Music] trx does break nine cent level here, with a strong daily candle, you are very likely gonna get at least one bounce here, you know, at the nine cent level, at least one bounce to create a double top or a low, or a slightly lower high
or, you know, potentially you're just going to get rejected from this range
you know, we talking bullish right now, in a bearish sentiment market
so if we go to the daily chart, you know, let's keep it pretty clear
i think in the the the likely scenario is actually going to get rejected from this range
we're basically going to get rejected, very likely from this level
we got the highs here created, um, uh, just a few weeks ago, on the 8th of may, to the lows
if we zoom out on the daily here, from this, descending, uh, from this symmetrical triangle, as you can see, yeah, this is very, very likely gonna get rejected
also this super, super nice, super nice reason why we also got a big rejection here from this, from this drop that we had from november, from november here on trx
we actually had a high on november of 12 13 fibonacci retracement from this high tore the ultimate low in january
you know, you're basically hitting that 50 percent fibonacci retracement
and and also, you're hitting the resistance from these lower highs
that was a much short position, right? it was a much short position
so i think we're not gonna successfully break above the nine cents
it's just very light unlikely to happen on trx right now in this bearish market sentiment
we got from the highs of november of 2021 to the lows, 50 fibonacci levels, almost the 90 at the 9 cent level
what else do we have? we got the lower high trend line, okay? from alltime high to the high of november, getting that rejection
also, confluence number two, we've also got look at this big consolidation
so you just add up stuff, and you're thinking, right? the price action of of trx is very unlikely going to get above this range
and if we zoom out here on the four hourly, you know, we can see that potentially trx is just going to get heavily rejected here
it's just very likely going to create that lower high and and potentially continue back down
what you guys talking about here in the comment section? you're absolutely crazy
make sure to check out, you know, you know, the the bonuses that i do have on buybit

if you sign up with a link, also down below, the info down below on primex bt, you do get an insane bonus also, seven percent added to your deposit
i've got two tutorials of these platforms by bit and primax bt
if you want to know what's happening with bitcoin, check out the beginning of the stream
i mark my levels very, very well, where we could find those opportunities
watch the beginning of the live stream for that bitcoin update
just one second, i am trying to give everyone the content so we can go straight into the charts
my computer is still very slow, so this just might take a little bit of time before i see you writing
[Music], so just one second, guys, i'm just trying to and see what we can find on bitcoin or and all of the other currencies
how are ya? how you doing? how are ya? you know exactly what's going on
my computer is still a little bit slow, so, um, if i get a little bit annoying annoyed about that, ignore that part, because i just need to express my feelings and then move on with my life
um, if you have not already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that so we can reach out to more people
how are you guys? where are you from? we have 54 people on this live stream
i was just thinking about you a couple of minutes ago, which is, like, wonder what seb sub is doing right now
as i told you guys before, i know one thing in russia, and that is, that is the only thing
i don't even know if i pronounce it right, but nintendo, you know
you i can't fly with you anymore because i moved from that apartment with the with the plane outside italy
uh, if you have not liked the live stream, we have, uh, 83 people watching this uh, 22 have, um, uh, likes it
but what we're gonna do is that we're gonna go in, oh, no, we can go into dxi and see what actually happened
so if you were not on my morning live stream this morning, um, if you're new to the channel, every single morning from monday to friday, i do have, um, morning livestream
and just look at the overall what's happening, what could possibly happen during the day
hit the notification so you know when i am live tomorrow also
uh, we're looking at the dollars, because when dollars goes down, bitcoin uh goes up
so on the higher time frames, we can see that we are, i want to see still how it looks on the six month chart
so if we're looking at the sixth monthly chart on dxi, we are right now retesting a previous resistance, right? so even if we see the market being in an uptrend, when you come to a previous resistance the market, usually, the market is usually bouncing
and in this case, we could possibly see the market bounce back down a little bit
so this is only because we want to understand what type of level um or at least that's how i see it
and the higher time frames you look at, the more respected, uh, the more the market will respect that area
so we go down to the three monthly chart also, and we got two previous resistance
and you can see how the market is, uh, retesting it from on the lower time frames, you will see that the market is um you will see that the market is reversing back down
okay, we don't have to come back down to 98600, but just to unders uh, in case we see a bigger drop, this could possibly be where we see the market come back down to
because when, when, if we see the market closing below one hundred and two point hundred, this could be the beginning of a little downtrend back down to potentially 98470, so around these levels
and each time the market came to that level, we saw the market, uh, having the, have the momentum to the downside
okay? and this is what we see now too, we see the market breaking below
we retested 102 points at 447, but on the lower time frames, if this will be accurate
so on dxi, it looks like we can come back up for a retest to create a lower high, and then see market continue back down
so when we understand the dxi is, uh, bearish, i go to bitcoin
and i know already that i am bullish, kind of on on bitcoin, but i'm gonna show you why
so, uh, looking at the overall, we are right now retesting a previous low
so you have wicks at twenty eight thousand nine hundred and seventy
and you also have it around twenty eight thousand eight hundred and thirty
so what i'm going to do is that i'm gonna use the low of these two weeks, right there
because that was also, you could see, that was the close that would did happen last week, last week week
we go down to the lower time frames, it's easier for us to see what's actually happening, because now the now the chart gives us higher highs and higher lows, right? and lower lows and low lows
so mark, you can see market structure more clear on the lower time frames
so, um, based on that, we can see the market now being in a being around a lower low
what we can expect is, potentially, now, based on that, what what we saw on dxi, is that we just might see the market creating a lower high now on the lower time frames, and then see the market reverse back down
because as long as we on the dxi um, i mean, we could obviously pull back up to again, 102460, potentially 102600
but this is only because i want to connect the dots and so i don't miss anything
so, looking at the four, i really the last lower high that we did have was 102
why do you trade live? why give your strategies up for free? because i'm, i'm a awesome human being
now, i answered your question because i'm an awesome human being
and on the lower time frames, you can see that usually what happens is that you see the market break, retest, and then continuation
but if we see that, we have so obviously two things can happen
you go up or go down, right? but if we see the market now closing above, you see rita's from up, uh, from above
and maybe from these levels, this is where you see the market being ready to drop, if that even will happen
and, you know, by trying to follow the rules, it's easy like that, because then we we're not involving our emotions and, you know, things like that that can complicate things, which is not good
so we're just gonna have to wait and see now if this will be the retest and then the drop
so i i was thinking about how i want to explain how i see the candlestick
so when i look at the candlestick, i jump in between so many different time frames
but that is only because i want to see on what time frame the market gives me the best candlestick, where i can what, where i can use to see what's going to happen, right? because the higher time frames, the better
the market gives us so many good clues on different time frames
so i try to find a candlestick that tells me where the direction is going to what's going to happen
and on the higher time frames, we can still see that we are still creating higher lows
and the higher lows, okay, you can also see, obviously, that we're creating lower highs also
so we're just waiting for the market to decide, are we going up, or are we going down? so we can do this
so we're using the support trend line from the push connected with higher low
okay, so when we look at uh, btc now, so what i did was that i dragged the fibonacci from 28 903, around that level, to 30 150
we came back down to this level today, and we saw, uh, the the market retested the 50 and 61, if we go down to the lower time frames
so we are exactly now retesting the fibonacci levels, but we do have some momentum
now, do we have something today? i i know that we were looking at this this morning
so i usually use forex factory for me to look at the usd what's actually happening
and when you look at it you can go to calendar, and the red boxes that you'll see, that represent that the market can affect the market, that it can be a volatiles
the yellow ones, no, the market is not going to react to it so much
but the red ones, you know, if you don't want to trade news and the market is giving you red box, just stay out of the it's just this, just stay out of it
so would you have some momentum now? so let's see how it's gonna look
i don't, i don't think i want to go in a possession right now either
i i think i just want to wait for the market to actually, um, juan, hello, how are ya? i just want to wait for the market actually to do whatever it's supposed to do
and, you know, um, because we're still inside of this resist uh
you can see how i how i um, just boxed in what the market is doing at the moment
and you can see how the market is just bouncing in between this trend line, support and resistance zone
it's so easy that, okay, we can have like the the perfect, we can have like the perfect entry right now, and when the news comes out, the market is just like going against us
so either if we move our stop loss to entry, it will just take us out, and or it will take our stop loss and then it will just freak out
so, you know, i'm not in a position at the moment, and i am pretty unsure about what the market is gonna do
so i'm just gonna, you know, sometimes we don't always have to trade
and it's totally fine that you don't know exactly what the market is doing
we just analyze everything, and when the market is ready to do whatever it's supposed to do, that's when i take the decision
i do believe that we will have the market break on bitcoin, breaking to the upside
and we are inside the fibonacci levels where we could see the market creating the higher low for potentially then see the push to the level that the levels that i, i do believe we can come back up to for then reverse back down
because that is the whole, the the whole scenario is that i actually believe that we will come back down to these levels, and then see the market slowly, instead it pulled back up to higher targets
and and from those levels, um, i think it is, i i thirty one thousand, thirty two thousand, and then see the market reverse back down
i do believe that we can come back down to 26 000, or potentially 20
oh, do i believe that? okay, first level is definitely 25, 25 k on bitcoin
and then we, i don't know what's going to happen, but that is the, like, the overall that i see now
are you bullish or bearish? it definitely depends on from what perspective you look at, because you have different time frames
on different time i mean, you you got different trends on different time frames
so that is why we use the higher time frames to show direction
do you want me to continue to look at the coins that you want me to look at, or do you want me to have a little back test session with you now? um, i was thinking about just because the i, yeah, i just want that is just the question
like, you're the ones that watching me, so i, i want you to do what what you want me to do? hello, gunner
is that okay? and we will also do this in case we see, uh, bitcoin, uh, do something special
i go through a couple of the coins, and then we do some back testing
so at the moment, we, i mean, we could definitely, let's see what dxi is giving us
how does okay, we're gonna go to ethereum, we're gonna go to ethereum, let's see
so if we say the pullback on ethereum, the same thing we create, the market is creating a higher low
and another thing that we can spot on the charts is that we did have the support
and from that support, these two candlesticks that you can see here, these are a fake out from that support
and usually when we have a fake up to the downside, and this is happening when the market, uh, when the market creates a support or a resistance, what the market is doing is that this is the first support
the market comes back down, retest the exact same first support, and then you see the push to the upside
so that is, that is also a confirmation that this support can be very strong
potentially, it depends on how this daily candlestick is closing
but if you go to the 12 hourly chart to see how the market is behaving, we tried to break this level a couple of times, and slowly steady
um, okay, so this candlestick did close exactly to where i had the 1935 click, click
i took a fibonacci from the support, uh, from 1936 up to 1978, and came back down retest
and that, if that is the case, and the news that comes out soon, just might be where you see the market, uh, giving us to push to the upside, right? and when we go back to dxi, can you see? so this is where we saw where we wanted the market to okay, you know what? oh, oh, my computer is going fast now
what happened? it's just completely changed what i'm gonna go in a okay, one second, guys
so, grjr, this is the last time i see you commenting on my, my, my, my live stream like this
okay, so it looks like on on aave that we can pull back up to potentially 118 or 128
we tested it quickly go down to so that is on the weekly chart
on the daily chart, the last higher, the last lower high, kind of that we did have was this ugly little resistance that you can see
if we go to the 2 12 hourly chart, you could see how we broke
so okay, so just by looking at it, we do have a pretty volatile candlestick on the daily
now, as you guys can see, um, one of the things that we can do is that we drag a fibonacci from the low at 81, back up to the high at 106, go down to the lower time frames
it's only because, you know, sometimes when you analyze, you just need to have the right focus
so that's why, um, we just might see the market pull back down to potentially 94 or 91
from these levels, you we just might expect the market to pull back up
um, so yeah, i'm waiting for the market to pull back down to these levels and then potentially see the pullback to the upside
because on the higher time frames, it looks like we we need to pull back up to create a higher, lower high, and then see, potentially the market reverse back down again
that makes us being able to potentially trade the pullback and then see the, uh, the break to the downside
why do you delete? why do you delete all fips over one? my question sentences
so, um, when it comes to like, my computer is just not working with me from nowhere, the the charger is not, it's not, you know, good
everything that has to do with taking technique is not working for me today
why i why i take away some of the fibonacci levels is only because i don't need them
so yesterday we spoke about solana 2, or this morning, i don't remember
but we are retesting a previous resistance, if you go back in time
so, um, when when we look at the charts like this, this is also something that is really important, is that we need to focus on what's actually happening here, right? um, we usually never focus so much on what's happening, um, back here
but we need to do that when we don't have anything around these levels to look at, because you can see, it's an empty space
okay, where are we at the moment? and this is a previous resistance and market creates now, no, yes, a previous resistance
and from a support, what usually happens is that you see the market push to the upside, and then continues back down, because we are still in a downtrend
which means that just because we see the market giving us some momentum to the upside, that doesn't mean the whole thing will change
because i don't think that the bearish cycle is um is about to end, not quite yet
i think we need to come back down to certain levels and then break break to the upside again
but the market always gives us clues, and we are still below this trend line right here on the on the eighth hourly chart
from a bullish perspective, sorry, from a bearish perspective, if we see a pullback up to potentially 5141 or 52 points, sorry, 5206, and you see the market coming to this level and start to, slowly, on the lower time frames, break to the downside
if we see that we have a bigger momentum to the upside, and we break this resistance trendline, because this is the one telling us that we're still in a downtrend
if we break that level, that could take us back up to potentially 57 points, 12 or 60 points, around, yeah, around 60 dollars
and from these levels, this is where we potentially then see the market break down
i do believe the market will create come back up to create a lower high
but where can that lower high be? so either it will come back up to the first fibonacci levels that i that i showed you, or you see the market having a bigger momentum and comes up to the higher time frames fibonacci for then see the drop
and that's why i, you know, just jumping into a trade just because you want to, you know, be in a trade
it doesn't make sense because you're just gambling with your account
uh, if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, go inside and do that, because i do have daily updates by cryptocurrencies
now, i, i love how i love to have the live streams together with you
mr nc, is not new? um, so, yeah, if you are new overall on uh, on trading trading
um, going to market structure, part one and part two, because these ones are like the best thing ever
these are, you need to understand market structure for you to be able to understand what, what the market is doing
so if you don't look at my live streams, or you don't look at my videos, i or you don't, you know, you already had done that
and mark mark my word when i say that, you will come back and tell me, hey, natalie, this is the best thing i've ever done to myself
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
by doing that, and me, because this is how i am able to sit here and share my thoughts with you every single day, and, you know, go through back testing
at some point, can you discuss your stoploss strategy, especially as a, uh, yeah, sure
we can take that in one of the back testing sessions that i will have
maybe not today, but definitely something that, uh, that i will do
we're gonna go back to bitcoin, because i told you that we were just supposed to go, oh, yeah, we can go to us 30
can you see how the market came back down exactly to my fibonacci levels? 15 61
so this, i don't remember exactly when i traded us 30, or when i did this analyze, but this is amazing
so i expected the market to come back down to thirty one thousand three hundred and eighty, and then to potentially thirty one thousand three hundred and sixty three, pull back up to the higher time frames fibonacci for then a reverse
but the beauty of this is that, can you see how perfectly the market came respected the levels? you take profit one, two, three
and if we had, or i take profit at, uh, the fibonacci, that is 7566 pips
can you say like, and the draw down, if we took the fibonacci, if we took the buy from the fibonacci, i would have had my stop loss around, uh, let's see
and obviously, you need to understand so many other things too, but it's definitely, and, yeah, so this is how it looks like
i'm gonna, i haven't treated you 30, uh, in a couple of days or so because or weeks, couple of weeks
you see, slowly, steady, how the market is, um, trying to break down
oh, so, yeah, i think it's really important to look at what bitcoin will do inside between, uh, 29 530 and 29 382
as i told you, i i'm not gonna go into, i'm not gonna go into the charts right now
i'm not gonna trade right now, because we do have the meeting, and the market is very volatile
so guys, do you want me to to start with the back testing now? do you want me to start with the back testing, please confirm
or if you want me to continue to to look at some coins? uh, either way
either way, the market, i will still wait for the market to um, i'm waiting for the news that comes out, that comes out today, wednesday
so we have, we have some people that want to do some back testing, which is really good
would you say that crypto is easier to trade than forex? um, no, i would say crypto is um, [Music], i think forex is easier than crypto because crypto is so, is so volatile, and you have so many fake outs on crypto, cryptocurrencies
it looks like bitcoin will go down, and then potentially, when, you know, the news comes out, the market is going loco
when we back test, i want to take, um, i want to see where, what's the best
it's just, you know, when you've been study one pair for so long, you just kind of understand how the how the market is moving
um, even if it's pretty volatile, but if you practice one thing, you will eventually be good at it doesn't matter what you do
so, okay, so what we're gonna do, so what we're gonna do is that i i did go through this on the other back testing streams also
and i'm gonna put the chat now into because we're gonna have a session where we um where we back test
so i'm gonna make the chat a little bit slow now so we don't get distracted, or i get distracted
how are ya? okay, so i put the chat in slow mo because we don't want to get disturbed when we, when we look at the chart
so i will go through, i will back test the market now together with you
so if you have pen and paper, this is the best time to take it, to take it
so what i'm gonna start to do, because this is the most important thing when we look at the charts
most important thing is that we understand high highs and higher lows, lower lows, lower highs
very important when it comes to that, because we don't have so many good things here
so in the uptrend, what we look for is the higher highs and higher lows
market is important for us to unders identify where the support and resistance is
because the market is is bouncing in between the support and resistance
in the uptrend, what we try to figure out is where the higher low is, and we buy from the higher low
and we know that we are in the uptrend because the market is creating high highs and high lows
so we know at that at that point that we will break the previous higher high to create another high high
okay? so when we understand that we are at a higher high, we know that the market needs to pull back down to create a higher low
now we'll ex i will show you how to do that on the higher time frames, and then how we just break everything down to the lower time frames
because if you sell the market at the lower low and the market pulls back up, you will be in draw down or and maybe you are over leveraging
so, and we don't know how we don't know exactly how far the pullback will go
but that is why fibonacci is so good when it comes to that, because it's so accurate when it comes to like it respects the level so so much
so one of the things, you know, when i back test, what i do is that i just go straight to the charts and just go back in time to see, um, what happens when the market is creating
so we need to understand, okay, why did the market reverse from this level here? because we can see clearly with our eyes now that the market, from this higher low push to the upside, right? so it's really important for us to understand what happens there
okay? so by starting off with dragging a fibonacci from the last higher low to the next higher high, can you see how perfectly the market came back down exactly to the fibonacci levels? so now what we know is that the fibonacci levels is a really good confirmations to use on the higher time frames
because when you do back testing, back testing gives you the the con the confidence to look at the market and know that most of the time when the market comes to these levels and do this and this and that, the market does this
so that's, that's the confidence that you want, but still being humble, because you just might also be wrong
but the more you back test, the better you become with being confident to what you look at
so, uh, to the to the woman that asked me in the beginning, why do i share these things on the charts? i'm sorry, i talk a lot
when i show you what i see on the charts, and someone asked me, why do you give it for out for free? the thing is that i give it out for to you for free, but everything is up to you if you choose to study what i show you or not
because i can give you everything that i know, you will still not be able to trade the market the way i do it, or anyone else does it? because if you don't back test it, you have no clue what you look at
if i show you everything, if you don't back test you don't know
so even if i give it up for free, you still have to do the work
and some people will be like, okay, but how do i know it's the higher high? okay, in this case, we broke the previous high high
so we can use that previous high high for a confirmation that this could be where you see the pull back down
and we use the previous higher high to see if we break below it
we don't know if the market only came back down and retested the 50, and then you see the momentum
but the thing is that when we when the market, usually on the higher time frames, needs to come back down to the higher time frames fibonacci to consolidate for a while and then see the push to the upside
so when you when we look at the higher time firms, fibonacci, it takes longer time for the market to reverse
on the lower time frames, you see how fast the market just like on the four minutes for hourly chart or 15 you just see a quick retest
and when we see the market, why is the price so different? is this even live? no, we do some back testing now
so for everyone that's new, we do some back testing because we want to see what the market is doing
so we use the previous resistance, and you can see how the market closes below and reach us from below
so that is a confirmation that we will have a push to the downside
okay, but now the most important thing, what happens at the higher low? right? we take away a little bit more
and on the lower time frames, we need to use the lower, lower lows and lower highs, because that is telling us that we're still in a downtrend
so now we're looking at the four hourly charts, but we don't have to wait for the market to break this resistance trend line, because this resistance trend line is the one representing the downtrend
when we break that level, you saw the retest here, that is the confirmation that the pullback is over
so we do have buy out orders at these levels, because we know that the market comes to it for a pool, for them continuation to the upside
this is where the most important thing happens, everything that happens down here is really important for us to to to look at
so what we also can do is that we go down to the 30, like the lower time frames
and we can also use the trend line here, um, from the last, from the the push that we did have from these levels is usually what i use
and every this is also, like, how do you do that? you need to back test it, but you need to connect the dots with the higher lows, right? and this one is actually really good that we that we do have
we saw the market came back down to the fibonacci levels we are
and this is also usually something that happens when we, when we are in inside a a hive time frames fibonacci, is that you see the market try to break the 61, and then you see the close above, and you see the retest exactly at the same level, and then you see the continuation
so remember, guys, this is why it's so important for you to backtest it, because the more you do it you understand how market moves
so we are starting to prepare ourselves that, okay, we need to look at buy positions now
because from this level, we do expect the market to reverse back up, right? so we use, we connected us with the trend line that is representing the pullback
and you slowly, instead, you see how the market creates higher lows, higher lows, right? and the higher lows is the one telling us that, hey, you know what? this just might be where the market is pulling back up now
so you have multiple buy opportunities here if you didn't buy the market at this because this was technically the first level you could actually buy the market, because this was the break of structure if we just, uh, use the box
the last lower high was at this level, and we just drag it out
this is why you need to understand market structure, because the market structure, market structure is lead, is giving you the way to what the market is doing
you see the market break the resistance trend line while we are inside the fibonacci levels
so what we do is that we drag the fibonacci from the last low to the first high high, because we did break the lower high, right? and i'm not going to use this one
and then you saw the push, right? so the best confirmation ever, like market is screaming guys, by the market right now
can you see how perfectly the market came back up and retested it? fifty percent? first we saw the first leg mark it comes up
we can go down to the lower time frames also, just to see what's actually happening
and that is also some mistakes that i can do, still till this day, is that i jump into the market too early, instead of waiting for instead of using the higher time frames, fibonacci, in this case, the one hour, four hourly
because when the market comes to these levels, the market respect them so much, and then you see the push to the upside
so what we're gonna do now is that we will see how it looks when the market creates a lower high
now is the most important thing, how how does it look when we sell the market? okay? so one of the things that we can do, i just need to see a good one
okay? so we're gonna use this market created a on the higher time frames now
so now we know that, okay, the market needs to create a lower high again
and on the high that is why, uh, i know a lot of people were like, oh, yeah, the market is going up now
but what you didn't, what most people didn't understand, was that the market came back up to the higher time frames, fibonacci levels, to create a lower high, and then you saw the drop
and everyone was like, but how could that happen? the market is going up
yeah, no, the market is creating a bigger pullback on the higher time frames
and i remember that i said on these candlestick that the market, we're supposed to, uh, break to the upside and then see the drop
and how did i know that? by just following market structure, and combined with candlestick and fibonacci
so the most important thing now is that, let's see we use the fibonacci from the last lower high to the lower low
on the lower time frames, you start to see the market, slowly, steady, creates a low, high, low, higher low, higher low, and then you see this huge momentum
and we come inside fibonacci levels, where would you expect the lower high to be created? what happens? market gave us one high, and now, slowly, steady, market slowly broke to the downside
and now we go into the lower time frames to see what's actually how what happened
remember, the higher time frames is always the ones that shows us the direction, right? so what we do is that we drag a support trendline, because the support trendline is the one connecting the dots
we are in the option right here, right? we are in the uptrend because the market does what create higher highs and higher lows
and even if we see the market, you know, even if the market, uh, break to the upside, sorry, my computer is crazy
um, even if you see that, if the market break the 15 61, i still have in mind that, okay, but this just might be a fake out, because we have so many fake outs all the time, right? so what i can do is that, okay, we did create a high high right here, but i do expect the market to reverse back down
so let's see what the market does against this pre this higher high, right? you see the market comes back down
so we need to adjust the support online, because this is still a high low
the last high low that we did have on this uptrend was this level, was this level right here, at forty four thousand one hundred two hundred
market came back down again, and then you saw another push back up
we can also use the pre the support of this high high, right? and can you see now, when when you start to see that the market comes back up and retested from below, you know what? we just might not actually continue to the upside, because we already have the fibonacci levels in the higher time frames where we do expect the market to duck, to drop from, right? and slowly
instead, you you see the market giving you the screams like, hey, you know what? this what happened right here, is only fake out
so many people went long on this one, and then they just saw the market break down
and they were like, what happened? what happened was that we came back up to the higher time frames, fibonacci levels again
it gave you the clues, if you saw the market for what it was, and not that you want the market to go up, because the market is screaming downtrend
remember that when we are using the trend line, we are never allowed to cut any candle
so what we're gonna do is that we're gonna adjust the, um, we are gonna adjust the trend line
because if i use the trend line like this against this high low, you can still see that the market is not respecting, uh, that level
now i obviously know what happened, um, already, because we back, we do the back test
but when you see the break of it, what i do in this case, i would have dragged my fib from the last high, in this case, to the wick when the, when the wicks are this, uh, tall
but this is also something so many people can be confused be like you
this is the thing, you have to play around with it, and just play around with it, and you get more comfortable with that
so what i would have done is that i take fibonacci from the last, uh, the last high that we when we are inside the support trend line, to the break
and what does the market give me? if the best entry i could ever possibly dream of
and on the higher time frames, depending on you can obviously have a short, just small take profits
but if we know that on the higher time frames, that this is actually the higher time frames lower high, what do you think will happen? we will break the previous lower low
this is where we sell the market, because we know the market is supposed to reverse back down, right? and we know that the, if following market structure, we know that we're gonna break the next lower law, which means that, okay, our take profit needs to be below the last lower low, because the market needs to create in the next lower law
can you see? like, and take profit one and take profit to on my fibonacci levels is also, like the greatest
and inside what happened here, we could obviously have taken like, multiples new orders
we could also have bought the market, depending on how good you are at, you know, looking at charts on the lower time frames, etc
but you this is like the, like, the best ever when you when you trade the market from the higher time frames fibonacci, because you know from that level you will see the drop, and you will have patient with it
and then, as i told you, we could have gone into other positions, just like quick positions, day trading, sculpting, whatever
so yeah, that's how you figure out where the lower height can be based on the fibonacci levels combined with market structure
another thing that i will show you is that when we, when we see the market starting to create higher highs and higher lows, and we have these fibonacci levels as target, what do you think that we will do? we trade the pullback
we drag fibonacci from the last higher low, because we know the market is any option
we try to buy the market a higher low, because we know that overall, we just might potentially come up to these levels for them to see the reverse
and this is what you see me do on most of my videos, is that i just try to connect everything together
what do we do next time? we take a fibonacci from the last high low to the next high high
the only thing that you need to understand is that, okay, are we in a downtrend option or a sideways market? so that's how you do it
guys, if you like this, put one, one, one in the chat if you learned something new today
we've been going through this a couple of times, like maybe two, three times
but when we repeat it, or we need to repeat it over and over again, that's how you get good at it
and when you understand how that works, you just add up trend lines
you just add up uh rsi, uh, depending on, i don't know what you what you use as uh indicators
just take what what connects with you, back test it, and then make it your own thing
because you are, you're just, you're, you need to be authentic
don't let yourself stop yourself for being a great, the best trader
in this case, take this what, whatever you think is really good for you from me, then you go to andy, and then you see, what? what does andy have that i need? or when you talk with each other, lauren, can you give the the people the link to the community? um, so if you want to be part of the community where i speak to you guys, you can have direct contact with me
um, we have a bitcoin census natalie community where we talk about charts every single day
so if you are new, if you want to talk to people with about cryptocurrencies, or want to have the latest updates directly from me, you go lauren, just put the the the chats in the live stream chat, you know
and if you, if you didn't know, you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
i love by bit because i can hold my position for a long time with the fees zero to low, very low fee
so don't forget that, uh, one, one one stands for new beginnings
so what we can see right now on bitcoin, as i told you, i'm just gonna wait for, would you have the fed um fomc meeting 8 pm? so i will wait for the market to do whatever
i'm just gonna wait for the market um to do whatever it's supposed to do
so now, this is the good thing when you because the market has done this multiple times before
and when you back test what the market has done multiple times before, what do you think will happen the next time? the market will do this again
you already kind of know, because you've been back testing it so much
and you're like, hey, you know what, bitcoin, i know what you do
so yeah, i i i wait for the market to actually pull back to the upside at the moment, we are at the low on bitcoin
we did have a fake out from the support also, since before um, and we are still creating, uh, higher lulls
and based on that, i do believe that, as i told you, we will have a bigger pullback
but the market will tell us kind of right away if that's gonna happen or not
um, we can also use fibonacci levels on the lower time frames to see if we just come to these levels, first of all
i think first of all we need to look at thirty thousand six hundred, potentially thirty one thousand nine hundred two
um, and we just might see the market reverse back down from these levels
so just wait for the market to to break certain levels and then, and especially now, when we do have the meetings of them, also, because the market can be very volatile

you should always solve your cell phone first, and know that you can do whatever you want to do
i'm sorry i'm late, but my wifi is crazy and my computer is really slow, and because i'm at a new apartment, and i know we should start off the morning with being positive, but i hate the internet when it's low
so just one second, guys, i can't see if you write anything, so just bear with me
i was supposed to go on a live stream 40 minutes ago, but my internet connection is not the best and it's a little bit slow
maybe you can't see it, but can you see my mouse is like going in slow motion
i'm so happy to see your your name when you write and give people answers
if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that right now, so we can, you can help me reach out to more people, and so we can
i love our internet because i can see this live in the beginning
i'm not sure if i have something that you're not supposed to see
and no, but we did have, we do have the great community where people woke up this morning and they told me they were in profit, or they take profits, got hit
also on yesterday's live stream, if you were not on it, we had a beautiful set up
um, after the live stream, i showed this to everyone on our community chat that we do have on telegram
and what we did, yes so yesterday on on the live stream, we spoke about abdul, yes, great
um, we went into the five minutes chart, we saw, we saw the break of this resistance trend line
and i told you guys that, uh, we did, we had two profits, uh, based on the same people
it was a little bit tight, because we saw the market, um, we saw the market have a little bit bigger push to did i have it like this? i think so
on the live stream that we did have yesterday on the on the new york session
and that was also combined with the 15 minutes last lower high
but then i started to see the market, you know, having a little bit more momentum
so instead of just me panicking, what i did was that i went to the one hourly chart
i just dragged the fibonacci, adjusted the fibonacci a little bit
i just adjusted the fibonacci a little bit from the low to the high
and can you see how this? fifteen sixty one point eight percent just got retested so perfectly
i'm not sure how long they're gonna scream, but if it disturbs you, i do apologize
even though i am no financial advisor, congratulations to everyone that was on my live stream yesterday and you took some, uh, profits
so i told you guys that, okay, we are coming back down for potential retest
i just might have used to take profit three at the fibonacci levels where i did expect the market to reverse
can you see how perfectly the market came back up? so the push from this high, so we did was the pullback, right? so i'm gonna take this fibonacci away so it looks better
but we did have another take fibonacci level, uh, where i did expect the market to pull back up to
can you see how perfectly, like, oh, my god, lauren, yes, i live in eastern mountain
now, how did you know? oh, no, everyone knows that i live here
can you see how perfect this is? guys, like, this is mindblowing, though
and i'm so happy that i can share this with you guys, because this is what the market does all the time
so by just practicing this over and over and over and over again, it's amazing
because the thing that we want to do, we just want to know how to trade the market, and then we want to continue with our lives, right? so we find a strategy, we master the strategy, we go into the charts, and then we do whatever we want to do with our lives, because that is what we want with trading, right? and then, obviously, you know, we sit in front of the charts
sitting in front of the chart is like a job, but it's the best job ever
so what do we do now? well, we look at the fibonacci levels that we came inside, and remember that we are also retesting the trend line that i do have from the daily chart
how are you? how are ya? so even if, okay, so so the thing is that we just might have a little bit
because if you, if you're new to my channel, what i usually do is that i go into, what i usually do is that i go into the to dxi, because they are correlating against each other
so, um, so when the x i go down, bitcoin goes up and vice versa
and we expected the xi to pull back, and i don't think the pullback is ready yet to i think that we will have a a little bit more of a momentum to the downside
if that is the case, that also means that bitcoin and ethereum will continue back up a little bit
on dxi, i do have my, my fibonacci from 98200, around that level, back up to 104378
and the fibonacci levels i do expect us to come back down to is 101393 and, uh, 100695
if lauren is still here, lauren, do you want to give them the, do you want to give them the the channel to our telegram group? lauren is such a wonderful moderator that i do have, and she helps me so much
i just want to say, thank you, lauren, for taking your time and just love it
combine your talent fibo with elliott wave tactics and you get more of it
we always want to improve, right? so i'm gonna actually start to practice that
so, yeah, you have the chat in the live chat, and you're more than welcome
so i do have my bitcoin census with natalie, so you're in direct contact with me
um, so for example, this morning i was a little bit late, so i i wrote it there too
we share our thoughts with bitcoin, our cryptocurrencies, etc
so on dxi, we do expect the market to pull back down to these fibonacci levels, first of all
so this is on the weekly chart on the daily what we also did yesterday, or to a couple of days ago, was that we did break this previous higher low that we did have on the uptrend until we reversed back down
and what we could potentially see the market do right now is that we see the market pull back up and retest, potentially, the support, take it as a new resistance
and that could be the momentum back down to these fibonacci levels, where we then expect the market to reverse back up
another thing that we will do is that we will drag the fibonacci on the daily chart to find out where the lower high can be, and then we go to um, then we go to bitcoin and ethereum, to see what's actually happening
and you can see how perfectly this fibonacci level is combined with where the previous support is
so for us to pull back up to these levels is a high probability
and this is the thing, like when can you see, also, with this fibonacci, take profit one, take profit two, was exactly combined to where we see the mark to the fibonacci levels on the higher time frames
so by just identifying the downtrend, what we do is that we drag the trend line like this
so as long as we're below the trend line, we're still in a dumpster
which means that on bitcoin, we are potentially still in a little options
so just because we see the market pulling back down, now we we still need to think about how it looks on dxi
because, to be honest, i do believe that we will have a little bit more push to the upside
would you have anything today on the calendar that will affect the uh, usd pair
okay, is it? so nothing special on on? oh, yeah, we do have fed meeting
i so, yeah, i i do believe that we will have a push to the upside
but just one second, i think we will have, i don't think we're done with the vert
what happened over at night, the computer just started to be slow from nowhere
i i'm so good at the technical but when it comes to computers overall, i am so not good at it
how are ya? okay, so looking at bitcoin now for other, uh, for another entry um
i still believe that we will continue back up, even if we're still below this versus this triangle um
but on the higher time frames, this is the most important, the most important thing is that on the higher time frames chart, on the three daily we do have this inverted hammer
i didn't look at the in the three daily chart a couple of days ago
but i do believe that we need to fill this wig with a candlestick that will close like a bullish candlestick, not just have, not just have the wicks
i do believe that we will see the market fill a wick, potentially up to maybe 32 000k, 32k, and then maybe see a reverse back down
so i definitely, i definitely believe that we will have a push
on the higher time frames, we're using the fibonacci again, as always
and then i, i, i do believe that we will have a push to the upside
so so usually, as you guys know, i mean, we can definitely do this too
we just might see a pullback up to 29 870, if we don't drop right now, or 29 915, market push back down
take profit three twenty nine thousand three hundred and forty two from these levels
this is where i do expect the market to slowly reverse back up and then continue to the upside
please guys, support my channel by liking the livestream so we can reach out to more people
if you are new to the channel, go inside and subscribe to it, because i go through daily updates about cryptocurrencies every single day, seven days a week
so i thought the market was supposed to go down during the live stream
we put some buy limit orders because we changed our mind with the market
um, so by even if we see the market go down, and then it's like, you know what? the market is not going down anymore
and we put some buy limit orders on to it take profits got hit this morning
and so yeah, this is, uh, going subscribe to the channel so you don't miss out, even though i'm not finance, financial advisor
but don't miss out to learn about how to read the market in a very simple way
and sometimes i share some entries and take profits, even though i'm no financial advisor
so don't forget to subscribe to the channel, hit the notification so you know when i am live next time
and don't forget that on bit you can also receive a bonus up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
and i'm also gonna pin it in the chat, so you know, this is how you are supporting me in the consensus
but also remember that when it comes to vibe, it is super good to, uh, hold your position for a longer time with very low fees
and it's, it's a little bit hard in the beginning if you're new to it, but it's totally fine
if it, if we don't just drop now and then potentially see the market reverse back up
and when when new york session is happening, i think we will be down here somewhere, and we just might, potentially also see another buy opportunity, uh, on bitcoin
do you ever consider using patterns trading? i always use, i always use that
maybe i don't say it, but in my head, i look at the candlestick and i look at patterns all the time
okay, looking at ethereum, because i still look at buy opportunities, even if you see the market come back down to these levels now
um, so on ethereum, i look at 1970 and 1960, uh, to see the market reverse back up
so on the lower time frames, what we can do is that we also use the resistance trend line, because this is the one that is representing the downtrend
so when we come back down to the fibonacci levels on during new york session today, if the, if this is the case, we just might see the break of the resistance trend line, and then you see the push to the upside
because i don't think the overall picture, we are still in a downtrend
but what we look at now is a option, because the market needs to pull back up on the higher time frames
so if the pullback on the higher time frames need to happen, that's when we'll see a bigger momentum, obviously, to the upside
and some people can be confused that, oh, no, the market is going up now forever
it's just because on the higher time frames we need to, we need to, we need to create a lower high
so in the lower time frames that you that is when you see the momentum
so, yeah, uh, looking at ethereum, we can pull back up to the previous support combined with the fibonacci at 21, twenty, 2123, potentially two thousand one hundred and seventy three
come up to these levels, either we, you know, either we see the market break it and continue up
or we actually just come back up and retest it as a lower high, and then see the the drop
because overall, what i see on ethereum is that we will potentially come back down to one thousand five hundred dollars again, until review river reverse back up
i saw, i saw aave that you want me to look at, so i will go to it, of course
why is my computer slow? can someone help me with that? it happened from nowhere
what could possibly be the reason? because the wifi or the internet, it shouldn't be that one, because it's slow even if i don't use the internet
i did restart the computer and i updated it, but it's still still okay
i'll try to do it after the live stream, so hopefully it's better
right now, we could potentially, uh, pull back up to this previous support, um, at 116
cr we come back down, we retest a previous supply, uh, sorry, a demand zone
either we see, obviously, the market reverse back down, or on the highest time frames, i think we have a, would you, we do have a fibonacci level where the lower high can be expected
if we don't see the pushback up right now, we just might see the market, uh, we did retest the 50 at 1007
we just might also come back down to 991 or 100, and then reverse back up
um, if we, we just might only see the market pull back up to these levels and then reverse back up
but when i put my, if i put more than one order in, i obviously always move my stop loss to, first of all, entry and then to take profit one, then to take profit two
but i've, i just say this out loud, even though i'm no financial advisor, if i take three take profits, i always move my stop loss
so in case the third tick profit does not get hit, we come back down, and our take, our stop loss, get take us out, still in some good profits
so that is really important, because sometimes, say, profit 3 can be a little bit far away
and especially when you come back up and potentially retest this previous support that we did break, and we just might might only retest the 50
and from these levels, um, this is where i do expect the market then to reverse back down
i tried most of the things, but i'm gonna, i'm gonna try to see what i can do after so thank you so much for the help, guys
and let's see what else you want me to look i, uh, please look it
what is that? i don't think i've ever looked at what is that? d f e, oh, uh
try using a cleaner on your pieces such as okay, okay, well, this baby's going down, down, [Music], not it could just be the change in, oh, i just did that this night
but it looks like we can drop back down to zero, or at least come back down to 341
but if we see a little bit of a push to the upside, we just might only retest the previous support at 100, 1003 for then see the the continuation down
okay, so it actually looks like we can come back down now to the seven point nine thousand seven hundred ten
but [Music], i, i believe that because on the higher time frames also, and, um, she tortured her computer every day
we come back down to, potentially, as i told you, around six points and nine thousand nine hundred and twenty, around these levels, guys
so at the low of this week, we just might see the market come back down and retest the support trend line, and then slowly see the market push back up
i do believe that we can come back up to as eight point four thousand and eighty seven, potentially at nine point one thousand six hundred and forty, and potentially see the market, um, drop from these levels, because we follow what the usd uh
what use these uh, doing the dxi? um, but if we see that we do break, um, this low at the wick, that could definitely be the continuation back down
so always, we always need to see the market from two different ways, obviously
but overall, the market is in a downtrend, but the market needs to pull back up on the higher time frame
because if you didn't know, on twitter, uh, bitcoin census, we do have, uh, different social media platforms

my name is josh, and right now the bitcoin price is forming a massive fractal on this brand new bitcoin charts
so i'll be talking about that in just a moment, alongside the ethereum chart and also the stock market later in the video
just to let you know that we still have some shortterm support at around 286 k, and we also have this level of resistance coming into play at around 307 k, approximately
so as i mentioned yesterday, those are still the important points of support
and resistance in the shorter term that i am paying attention to for bitcoin
and obviously, over the past one day, not a lot has happened for bitcoin and ethereum, which is why i'm just making the one video with all of the information in one video, rather than splitting it into two videos and just wasting your time
but what we also need to keep an eye out for is this pattern right here, which is technically a descending triangle pattern on the three hour bitcoin charts
and technically speaking, this pattern is more of a bearish pattern than a bullish pattern, because roughly around seven times out of ten this type of pattern breaks to the downside, and about three times out of ten it breaks to the upside
and even the structure of the pattern itself tells us some bearish signals
for example, the fact that we're potentially seeing a descending line of resistance shows that the selling pressure is slowly increasing, while the buying pressure is remaining stagnant, because we're seeing horizontal lows over the past one to two weeks
but considering the overall lack of momentum, especially over the past one week, if the bitcoin price simply comes back up towards this line, of resistance that i just talked about, then in that case, this descending triangle pattern wouldn't really mean too much, because we would most likely remain in some sort of sideways consolidation range in between this line of support and resistance
but if we see a confirmed break below around 28 and a half thousand, which is also the support line for this descending triangle pattern, then in that case, the technical price target to the downside would be coming in at around 25 to 26 thousand
but obviously, as of right now, at least at the time of recording this video, we have not seen a confirmed break below this support line, at least just yet, which means that 25 to 26k price target is not in play, at least as of right now
and just giving you a quick update on the daily bitcoin charts, obviously we still have this active bullish divergence, which is why we're seeing a lot of reduced bearish momentum after that massive bearish move that we saw a few weeks ago
but if you've been keeping up to date with my videos over the past few weeks, you would already know about this
in fact, right after that crash, after we hit the price target down towards 25k
i was mentioning over the next couple days, how we're most likely about to see a lot of sideways, choppy price action
and obviously, that's pretty much exactly what we've seen over the past one to two weeks
and so considering the fact that this virgins is still active on the daily charts, and this bullish divergence is still active on the twoday bitcoin chart, that is still mostly what i'm expecting in the shorter term, talking about the next few days, maybe the next one to two weeks, just simply more sideways, choppy price action, relatively speaking, unless we see another signal, in which i'll be sure to keep you updated if anything changes
and if you zoom out to the weekly bitcoin chart, and in fact, this right here is not just the weekly bitcoin chart
so essentially this chart shows us how bitcoin is performing versus the nasdaq 100 index, so basically the tech stocks
so when bitcoin is pumping on this chart, that means bitcoin is outperforming the nasdaq 100 index
but if bitcoin is dumping on this chart, that means bitcoin is underperforming against the nasdaq 100 index
and obviously, this chart looks very similar to the normal bitcoin to your solar chart, but there are some important differences
for example, if you're looking at the two highs that we've set over the past one year, approximately, we actually saw a lower high when you value bitcoin against the nasdaq 100 index, whereas if you look at the bitcoin to us
dollar chart, we actually saw a higher high, a slight higher high, back in november last year
and also on the bitcoin us dollar chance, we have already broken below the low that we set during the middle of last year at around 30k
obviously, we dropped down towards around 25k, but when you value bitcoin against the nasdaq 100 index, we have not broken below that previous low, at least just yet
so what this does is reveal a massive fractal that is happening right now to what we saw during 2018, 2019 and 2020
obviously, back in 2017, we saw a massive bull market, and then we went into a bear market in 2018
and then at that stage, we started forming a higher low structure
and then after the bitcoin price bounced around at this lower price range for a few months, we saw an explosion in the bitcoin price all the way back up
but we did not make it all the way back up to this previous height
and then we experienced quite a bearish time in crypto, especially during the march 2020 crash
and that actually started a recession in multiple countries around the world, even though it was shortlived
but basically everything in the world at that stage, especially in financial markets, looked absolutely horrible at that stage right there
and usually when that's the case, when things look horrible, when everyone's fearful of more bearish price action, that's usually a pretty good time to pick up some cheap assets, like bitcoin, for example
now, obviously there is different things happening in the world right now compared to back then, but the levels of fear and the levels of panic at the moment are quite similar to what we saw in early 2020
and yes, it's possible that this fractal might not even play out, but it is something important to at least keep in mind during a time in the market where almost everyone expects things to get a lot worse
but even if this fractal does play out, we still have a lot of work to do
first of all, we obviously have to bounce back up towards this line of resistance
and then we need to see a confirmed breakout before we can expect any significant bullish price action like this
so as you probably already know by now, i am still expecting more sideways, choppy price action in the shorter term, speaking about the next few days or so for ethereum, and looking at that shortterm neutral price range that ethereum is sitting in right now, we have an important line of supports coming into play at just above 1900, at around 1910
and we have two key levels of resistance that i am paying attention to, which are coming in at around 2060 and around 2 150
and what's interesting about those two levels of resistance right there is they're not only based on previous price action where we've previously found rejections, they're also based on fibonacci levels
for example, if you bring up the fibonacci tracing tool from this height down to this swing low, we have a golden pocket sitting at around 2060 to 2070
and then if you zoom out a bit further, bringing out the fibonacci trace material from this high up here at around 2450, down to the swing low at around 1700, we also have a golden pockets, which is sitting at around 2150, approximately
and while we're on the four hour ethereum chart, we have another symmetrical triangle pattern that is technically forming right now
obviously, we have a descending line of resistance, which was previous support that then flipped into new resistance, and we have an ascending line of support, showing higher lows in the price of ethereum
so this type of pattern by itself, isn't necessarily bullish or bearish
but technically, we can take into consideration the trend that ethereum entered into this pattern, which was obviously a downtrend entering into this pattern
which means it could be slightly more likely that ethereum breaks to the downside rather than to the upside, because this can act as a trend continuation pattern
but ideally, we just need to wait for a confirmed break below support or above resistance
and right now, this line of support is coming into play at around 1930, and this line of resistance is coming into play at around 2060, and heading over to the ethereum versus bitcoin chart on the threeday time frame
obviously, i said that yesterday, because what we have seen recently on this chart is a break to the downside, and then we saw a very small retest of this previous line of support, which is now acting as new resistance, because we saw a rejection from that line
and over the past one day, we've just seen a threeday candle close, which confirms the last three daily candle in the red, which basically cemented that rejection in place
so the last confirmation signal that i am looking out for on this chart to further confirm this breaks at the downside, is a break below this previous low, sitting at around 0064 bitcoin per ethereum
and there's a couple reasons as to why i want to wait for that confirmation of the break below the previous low
the first reason is because, technically speaking, at the time of recording this video, we are still currently in a higher low structure on the larger time frames
so we technically don't confirm a larger downtrend until we actually break below the previous low, because in that case, obviously we'll be looking at lower lows
and considering we've already seen a lower height, that would officially put us in a larger downtrend
and something else to consider is, even if we do find some supports at these previous lows and bounce back up, that could potentially lead into a head and shoulders pattern, which is technically a bearish pattern as well
and so if we see that final confirmation of the break below that previous low that i just mentioned, then personally, i'll be moving some of my ethereum into bitcoin as ethereum potentially underperforms against bitcoin, considering it would be in a downtrend at that stage
and looking at the daily time frame for ethereum vs bitcoin, right now, this bullish divergence is really getting tested
because if ethereum drops any lower against bitcoin in the shorter term, then that would bring the daily rsi below this upper shooting line of support, which would essentially invalidate this bullish divergence
so this is also something that i am keeping in mind moving forward
and heading over to the bitcoin dominance chart on the threeday time frame, we are still seeing a continued breakout to the upside, which is not good for altcoins
i repeat, it's the ones that are heavy in old coins right now that are most likely going to perform the worst
because obviously, as the bitcoin dominance climbs, that means bitcoin is gaining market share over the total crypto market, which means altcoins are losing market share against bitcoin
and so essentially, while the bitcoin dominance is breaking out to the upside here, the old coin market is underperforming bitcoin, relatively speaking
now obviously, considering the fact that there's tens of thousands of old coins out there, this is not gonna be the same for every single alt coin in the entire market
this is just talking about the overall altcoin market on average
stock market today, this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the four hour time frame
and yes, that bullish divergence that i've been speaking about over the past few days is technically still active
and you can see right here, at the time of recording in this video, we are still playing this out
because that simply means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, which is exactly what we've seen since the bullish divergence that i mentioned a few days ago

i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
it's matt, and i'm here to bring you another bitcoin update video
so with us approaching the end of may for bitcoin, i'm going to discuss what we can look out for for the remainder of the month
and just a quick reminder, if at any point in time you enjoy this video, then i'd appreciate it if you dropped a like and subscribe if you're new to the channel
and last reminder, we have a link in the description to join my public trading community
and if you're also interested in additional trading guidance, then you can also check out one of the links down below too
so now, starting off on the daily time frame, we have a clean chart of bitcoin
and so if we remind ourselves of what bitcoin has recently done, obviously we know that bitcoin has basically, since the end of march, fallen over 40 percent, and actually got very close to 50 just earlier this month
and so now we're in a phase where we're simply consolidating very heavily
and as i discussed, what i'm waiting for is for a probable break above these recent highs that are marked at slightly below 31 000
okay, so this range, let me actually narrow this down a little bit further
this is a region where we have rejected the price action multiple times through resistance or through support
now what we have to understand as if you're going to look at ranges, and if you're going to use support and resistances, understand that it's not a fine line, right? so don't just connect to a single high, a single low, and expect that if the price action breaks above or below it, that it's over and the market structure is going to shoot in that direction
because one example, a very recent one, is right over here on may 15th, where we spiked above this recent high of march 13th, we gathered up the liquidity that was provided here, and then we dropped down, right? so the reason why i'm bringing this up is because if we encounter a situation where we can clearly see that after each consecutive drop in bitcoin, the bearish momentum is still pretty intact
if we encounter a scenario where we dropped out, if we drop outside of this range, so let's say we drop all the way down to 281 or 28 000, don't expect this level to hold for a 100 certainty, right? so this could simply mark the last liquidity grab where this entire range can be seen as an accumulation cycle, where we drop down, gather up the liquidity that was provided back here, which i can guarantee, there's most likely a price inefficiency left behind at these prices, which i discussed in the last update
so we can get that drop down below this range, and then as soon as everyone jumps in, this can act as a bear trap
and so something like this can occur, honestly, within a single day or so, right? so don't expect something like this to be incredibly obvious, because liquidity grams, as we know, are not obvious
so if i replay the one we had over here, this is what the four hour closed looked like
and so i'm sure many people looked at this as, hey, we have a low followed by a higher low, and now we have a higher and a higher high
and so just because, uh, the scenario can arise where we drop below this range, i just want you guys to be careful a little bit, because you will see bearish candles, right? you're gonna see a bearish one hour or a bearish fourhour candle
and let's say the daily candle wicks down, leaves a lower wick and then closes back in the range, right? that's basically what it would look like
it can even occur on the weekly candle, so on the weekly chart
and so with that out of the way, what i'm still anticipating is that the price action, regardless of if we encounter a liquidity grant below these lows, which i think is pretty likely, since we do have similar lows priced at around 285 000
so typically whenever you have similar highs, similar lows these areas, as price action is consolidating, you get orders placed above or below them
and so that's we can get these spikes, right? and so now, because we're below the midpoint of this range, i wouldn't be surprised if we do get a spike down to 28 000 or slightly below that
but then what i'm paying attention to is if we close back up inside of this range, meaning that we have the liquidity grab and we gathered up the liquidity here needed for the buyers to continue pushing the price action higher
than what i'm anticipating for, and i'm leaning more towards this, is for the price action to push above these highs that i marked at third, slightly below 31 000
and i believe that we can push all the way up, personally speaking, above 327 thousand dollars
and the reason for this is because if we look back at the weekly chart, we can see how the weekly candle from two weeks ago, right? so now we're approaching the last week of may
so that weekly candle, despite spiking below these lows that we had during the middle of the summer of 2021, it never closed below this range
and so typically, whenever you have any, whenever you have these types of wicks, that push significantly outside of major ranges
whenever you have these wicks and the majority of a wick closes outside of the range, i don't expect these wicks to fill, uh, right away, right? so although we do have this wick, and typically if wicks close and sign of ranges, they will get filled
but since, again, this is outside the range, this marks a rejection, right? and so although we did push down to about half of this wick, i believe that this is the price action, as i discussed earlier, simply gathering up liquidity and filling any price and inefficiencies that were left behind here before we correct backup
and it's pretty evident to us where we can see how just how over extended bitcoin is, right? so if we look at the last couple of weekly candles, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine weekly candles that are bearish
and personally, if i had to make a bet, i would bet more towards the side of probability that we're likely not going to close bearish
this could close bearish, but just the fact that we have eight bearish candles and a look in a row, this type of price action rarely occurs for bitcoin, whether it's from the bearish side or from the bullish side
okay? and so i'm not saying that we're going to spike up immediately, right? this could take, uh, the last week of may
can simply, uh, consolidate where we close something like a doji candle
but then the week after that, so the week of june, i would be expecting a correction back up
so not only is that due to the fact because we still closed inside of this range, and we, and we rejected the bottom portion of this monthly range, but on top of that
going back to the daily chart, let me actually go down to the four hour chart
quick reminder from the last video, we have some price inefficiencies that were left behind from this last bearish, impulsive move
so if i measure this out with the volume profile, well, then the most significant ones that stand out to me, the first one being, we do have a minor one above the high of may 10th
it's not a significant price and balance, but this one i definitely believe can fill
but the ones above that, that, the next two that are more significant are the ones, uh, that are residing above 34 000
and it's very close, actually, to the round psychological number of 35 000
and the major, major one, so this one is pretty big, that is roughly at around 38 000
and so this is our price and balance all the way from 37 points 4 000 up to 38 points 2 000
okay, so we roughly have a range of seven or eight hundred dollars
and so i know that eight thousand dollars is a lot, but you know, we have seen corrections like this for bitcoin
so even when we got the drop from may to march 29th, even before we got this drop, notice how the price action managed to rally from 375 up to 388 000
and all of this happened basically within three weeks, right? so to push up eight thousand dollars, i don't believe is that unrealistic, especially if we consider the fact that a ton of traders probably looked to sell bitcoin once it dropped down below these lows of january, and especially below the annual lows of 2021
so temporarily speaking, i believe that this is one way that the market can psychologically put everyone on a roller coaster where everyone looks to jump out of bitcoin out of fear
the next thing you know, you get a seven or eight thousand dollar rally, everyone jumps back in, and then we have a resumption of the weekly bearish trend

so thanks for watching guys, and i'll speak to you in the next video
in this episode, we're taking a look at the bitcoin price on the one hourly chart
and i want to explain to you what major levels are, the most important, where we could find some big opportunities in the next coming days
so make sure to stay to the very end of the video, because i'm going to explain why i actually did put a small, long position here, below 29 000
all right, i'm going to explain exactly why i did this in today's episode
my position is already protected, but i need to explain why did i enter here below 29 000
and also, make sure to pay attention, because we're taking a look at v chain today
it's still continuing down, and it's going to go to lower levels
we're going to also talk about some potential major opportunities looking at v chain on the four hourly
but most importantly, what could v chain do in the next coming years? and this is the v chain against the btc chart
as you can see, we have five waves from the ultimate bottom of 2019 here, as you can see
i'm going to tell you, how long can this correction be, and when are we going to see the big, massive bull run for v chain? and the next coming years? taking a look at fibonacci time
in this episode, i'm going to explain to you every single detail so you can analyze the situation and visualize how v chain will have an excellent run in these next coming years

quick reminder, if this video gets over 2 000 likes and you comment down below, you are eligible for a free giveaway in bitcoin
because the last few days, all right, i'm not going to repeat myself much
for any new subscribers, you know, we do have this range trading zone, okay, in between thirty thousand, five hundred dollar range
as you can see on the one hourly, this big, major resistance and this big, major support level at twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, where we have been bouncing consistently now for over 10 days, as you can see here on the chart
so what can we expect for bitcoin? well, i don't know, but i know some major, big zones where we can get into big, major opportunity trades
we got this big, major weekly level at the 31 770, okay, below 32 000, where we could get that volatility, we could get that rejection, because also a value area high, as you can see here
and also, we do have this big, major resistance zone that we did create here back on the 10th and 11th of may
so it's going to be a lot of volatility, and potentially we are going to fail in to break this high over here and get heavily rejected
okay? so if we do go up there, then i am looking for that to be a big, major resistance for continuation to the downside
of course, if we do break this level in the next coming days, the 31 800, okay, approximately, uh, sorry, the thirty thousand five hundred thirty thousand six hundred, this level, this resistance, this value area high, i am looking for at least one potential bounce from this zone if we do get a successful breakout
okay, you know, it's pretty clear that this resistance should be having some kind of reaction
so if we do break out this zone and come down, at least we're gonna have one bounce, guys
but if we do have one bounce, okay, don't get too excited, don't get, you know, too greedy, because very possible you are going to create a lower high, and you might have a big, massive correction after this
this is what usually happens when you break up from these zones
you might just get one opportunity if this does happen in the next coming days
so make sure to analyze the situation, because this is something that could happen
now, of course, this would be the bullish case scenario in the short term
what happens if we do break support? of course, you know, there is also a scenario here that we do break down
of course, this major value area low is also going to be major resistance
so if we do get that breakdown and come back up, the first bounce is very probable going to get rejected, okay, here
and then you might create a higher low, because i think we are potentially not going to successfully break down this level and create a higher low for continuation to the upside, potentially
but there's major opportunities if you do solidly break out this resistance at 30 500, 600 or 28 600
so make sure to analyze the situation and dive into a potential trade if you wish
now, let me just explain, why did i actually long this level? okay? well, we basically created a swing failure pattern
i am in a trade right now just below twenty nine thousand dollars
i am already protected, because if this doesn't start pumping from this level, you know, we might just have that collapse
we have been range trading for such a long time right now, that you know, if you would have longed and shorted this level, you would have made incredible profits
so i just dived in here, and i'm probably late, but i was confident enough to see the swing failure pattern, watching failure pattern on the one hourly
well, we can clearly see, all right, this major consolidation right over here
and we could, if we put a trend line like this, you can see this one hourly candle getting that wick below and closing above
i want to show you several swing failure patterns that has happened, all right, the last 10 days
we've got one right over here, as you can see, big, major pump, big, major consolidation
what happened in this consolidation? you had a double top swing failure pattern, as you can see right over here
where else do we have one? i can see one already, right down over here, where you do have this wick below this low
okay, swing failure pattern on the one hourly, you wick above close the one hourly
what happens? you control the date and you turn the other way around
so this is why, you know, it is, you know, it is worth it to get into a trade on this level
all right, uh, from this one hourly, as you can see here, on by bit
all right, i got into that five minute retracement that we did have here in the immediate short term getting into that trade
and for all of those experienced traders, on buyback, you do get up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus

and also, you get up to seven thousand dollars on primax bt, my favorite day trading platform, if you use bitcoin sensors 50 as a promotion code
i have full video tutorials of these platforms down below in the description
it is very, very possible that we might come back up and attempt to break this resistance zone
and also, i am looking for that potential leg up to this zone, to this 32 000 area, in the next coming days
we're probably going to roll down from this level, okay, hit this major resistance and also not reach this high, because we've already been bouncing several times on these resistance support levels and then have that crash back down
but if i do get stopped out at breakeven tomorrow, we'll be having more opportunities inside of this range, guys
and what i want to show you here, keeping it super, super simple, just zooming in here, taking a look at the last four to five months of v chain
all right, creating a big, solid level here at the five cent level, just slightly below five cents, as you can see, big, major support range, big consolidations
you know, the last few months at this range, what has happened? we've had an insane drop here in may, all right, as you can see
now, what has happened now, we have created a big spike on the vpvr, as you can see, big consolidation
if v chain does get a relief rally, from the three cent level all the way here to the four point five, four, four point five cent range, this is going to be a huge resistance range
we've got a big spike on the vpvr, and it's very, very likely going to get rejected
okay, i do not know if we're going to go up there, but if we go up there, this is going to be very big resistance, guys
we might be forming an inverted, you know, bart simpson pattern
we might be creating that double bottom to get that relief rally to that four, 45 cent level
okay, guys? if we do come down and consolidate, then we are potentially looking for that swing failure, and we are going to see that double bottom, all right, in the next coming days
so far, this is the only thing that i can see here on v chain
but what i want to show you now, one of the most important things for people that do accumulate vchain there is a vchain huddler, because it strongly believes in the projects, is looking at the vchain btc chart
and if you are comparing, uh, some different altcoins, it is very good also to compare to the king cryptocurrency, bitcoin
if you have studded elliott wave theory, you know there is five waves, and there is three waves, corrective waves, the abc correction
and what i want to show you from the ultimate low, all right, from the bear market of 2018, 2019
what i want to show you, i'm just going to get this fibonacci time all right out of the way, because i want to show you, all right, how v chain is potentially going to bottom out before the end of 2022
but first of all, let's go from the bottom face over here of september of 2019, where we have seen one big wave all the way till december of 2019, and then a corrective wave, as you can see here, to april of 2020
then we had the third wave, then the fourth wave, and then the fifth wave, giving that massive, explosive move to the upside
so what is happening right now is that we have in, you know, after the fifth wave, we have a very, very large correction, okay, the abc correction, where can take many, many months
looking at this, you know, multiyear uptrend, of course, then we can see multiple months, even a few years, of correction, okay? and consolidation, entering an accumulation zone
and what i want to show you here is very important, okay? of course, the abc correction, the corrective wave that can go as low as the first or the second wave
it is very possible that we might consolidate here at this range for the next couple of years
of course, the abc correction can come as low, or even below, the first wave, and we actually at those levels
fibonacci time is an insane do it can predict where the potential corrective wave can bottom, where the wave can actually go to
and what i want to show you here is going straight here in to the lows of this of 2019
okay? this is the weekly chart from the ultimate low of the bear market for v chain, looking at the vet btc pair, was in september of 2019
and what you can see here, looking at fibonacci time, all right, you at least want a one to one
all right, where where you are having the mo the pump and the corrective wave? at least a one to one, all right? because usually the corrective wave is sometimes longer than the actual pump
and you can see here the onetoone fibonacci time from the ultimate low is right over here
and in between 1 and 1618 is where you want to see the end of the corrective move
and you can see here on v chain, all right, on the v chain, btc pair, this is where you ended the correction
and the time to the two has taken, okay, it's taken double the time of the correction
all right? you have actually bottomed up sooner at the one to one to one point, six, one, eight here
this is in between this green and black zone, as you can see, bottoming out at that range and then having the ultimate rally from the 2 to the 2618
you had an insane, insane rally, as you can see on the bitcoin, on the vet btc pair
let's take a look at the low here with fibonacci time from the low to the top of the pump
all right, as you can see here, on july of 2020, we can see right over here, same, very similar situation where i just explained to you, right over here, i'm going to explain right over here, where we do have the one to one, okay? or the one to, uh, sorry, or one 1618
so in between the one to one and the 1618 is where you bottoming out
you are bottoming out at this range after the correction, okay? after the big, massive pump, you are looking for the one to one
and in between the one to one and one point six, one, eight is where you want to be bottoming out
in the fourth correction, it is exactly bottoming out at the same timing, okay, between 1 and 1618
and what i want to show you here, from 2 to 2618 here, from blue to purple, you had the huge, massive runup
let me just go here, straight to the low bottom here, from september, 9th of september, to the highs
guess what? from blue to purple, from two to two, six, one, eight, you have the insane runup, peaking up
okay, as you can see here on the chart, from the ultimate low here, also right over here, from this third wave, sorry, to the fourth wave
okay, so this is the third wave, and the fourth wave is predicting the fifth wave, all right? with fibonacci time, as you can see from the two, from the blue zone to the purple zone, from the blue zone to the purple zone, right over here
you cannot count this fifth wave, because you are basically having, you know, the abc correction, which is a much larger extension
you need to count, you know, this first wave, because, you know the elliott wave theory, it's one wave, okay? and inside that one wave, you have five waves, right? so now we are in the second big, major corrective wave
now what i want to show you is, how long can this hold? the same that i have explained to you inside of this correction, okay? where you could potentially find that bottom in between the 1 and the 1618 fibonacci time
okay? we've, you know, predicting this potential bottom, all right, between 1 and 1618
now we want to know where can v chain bottom, looking at the vet btc pair, all right? and what i want to show you is going, you know, from the ultimate low of this wave, which is here in september of 2019
and if we go from this low to the highs right over here, we are looking for that abc correction to finish in between the one fibonacci and the 1618
and this is going to be potentially in between november of 2022 and also november december of 2023
and we are looking for that insane runup from 2 to two, point six, one, eight, like i showed you, from blue to purple
this date right over here is in between july of 2024 and july of 2025, where we could see that big, massive runup in between this range
so what i want to show you here also is that, um, we could potentially just go slightly to the downside
we could create sideways action, some small pumps, another dump over here
it's going to take a long time, and we should be bottoming out in between, like i said, november of 2022 and november of 2023, here on v chain
i know a lot of people want, you know, this is the very end of the bear market, but it's going to be boring, guys
we will be seeing some pumps, some dumps, a lot of sideways action
and what i am potentially expecting here on v chain, as you can see here, from, you know, 2019 and part of 2020, you know, that bottoming out of that range you still was, uh, till we started pumping, is, you know, this similar price action
if i take the bars here, all right, from the bear market, you could potentially be forming something like this in the next coming years
it's going to take several months, all right, to bottom out here on v chain
so it's going to be a massive, big opportunity to accumulate, because there is a possibility that v chain will be reaching extremely high levels
i can take a, i'll be taking a look at another video for expansion, okay? but it would be nice to see the next coming months where we could potentially bottom out for the fibonacci expansion, at least hitting that 1618
1618 is very, very, you know, easy to to reach, all right, from the top of the wave to the bottom of the second wave, you know, you're looking at the 1618 or the 2618 here, as you can see, hitting to perfection
so what i'm looking here for the next bull run is at least that 1618, okay? which will be insane
we're going to see v chain absolutely exploding in between 2024 and 2025
so this is a major opportunity that's going to happen in the next couple of years, guys, to accumulate, a good project such as v chain
we will be seeing some pumps, of course, some relief rallies, a lot of sideways action till potentially at least the end of 2023, and 2024 and 2025
of course, i would be aiming for may, because may is a, bearish, you know, a level is a bearish month for a lot of the markets
so i think that is going to be absolutely crazy, especially in between july of 2024 and may of 2025
is why i expect where we will be having that massive, massive rally to the upside
and this is just by looking at fibonacci time using elliott wave theory, abc correction, large consolidation and and this is the area where we are potentially going to bottom out, guys
so make sure to get ready the next couple of years, because it is lamborghini time, guys
check out bitcoin center's website for the latest news, technical analysis ideas
i've got the link down below in the description, totally free information
so [Music], how is everyone doing? i hope you're having a fantastic tuesday
today, let's dive in to see what is going on with bitcoin, with the traditional markets, the dxy guys
we're going to analyze the situation here for bitcoin, of course, or bitcoin on the four hourly chart
i also want to take a look at the traditional stock market, and also, very importantly, the dxy guys, the dollar index
it looks like that we are losing this last higher low over here at the 102 dollars, as you can see, breaking below this range
does this mean that the dollar index is finished its parabolic run? it is starting to have a pretty sharp correction
are we going to go to much lower levels? this is something that i want to know from the community, because about 65 of people from the poll said that the dxy will not be losing value the next coming weeks and months
today we also have powell talking at 20 past six, central european time
so there might be a lot of volatility at about 20 past six central european time
i might be doing another live stream to see if we can find some pretty cool volatility at that, uh time
and also, what happened to bitcoin? we were talking about this major level yesterday
i know a lot of people were bullish, you know, saying, you know, bitcoin pumping, bitcoins going up
we needed to break above this 30 500 range, as you can see here on the chart
we were talking about these lower highs, and we're still creating lower highs here
huge rejection from this point and came back down to retest this low area
so it is true that in the next, i would say in between 24 48 hours, we need to find a direction here on bitcoin
i am looking for this major level to potentially get a big rejection, a big reaction and a rejection from this range and a huge correction
if this does happen in the next couple of days, if we break support, i will be very, very bullish
i am looking for that higher low, or for that double bottom kind of scenario, which i think is very likely to happen
and you might think, okay, why do you think this? well, one of the main reasons, you know, okay, is, you know, looking at the coinbase chart on the weekly, one of the main reasons is the big volume on the weekly that i've been talking about the last few days, okay? and, you know, this has indicated a local bottom or a local top in the past, as you can see
and this means that we are probably not going to break down successfully the 25 000
every time we see a spike in volume like this on the weekly, it's indicated a bottom or a top
and this is why i do think that double bottom scenario is very, very possible
this is enough confluence to for me to think that, you know, if we do come down, and it almost feel the wick or feel the wick here on bitcoin
i'll be very much interested in long positions at 27, 26 000, okay? because i don't see that successful breakdown on bitcoin in the next coming weeks
and in the other side, of course, if we do pump to this range, okay? that would be the short term bearish, midterm bullish
this is why i'm here, giving you my opinion, then i'll go through the comment section
and midterm, uh, bullish, right? but what would be the shortterm bullish? term bearish, right? would be breaking this this high over here at the 30 500 and hitting round about that 32 000 range, where we will have potentially a lot of volatility
like i said on yesterday's video, it is the value area high from the last, you know, 15, 16 days of volume traded
as you can see, as soon as we dipped down below it has been a solid, solid resistance level
and i am looking for that potential swing failure pattern above this range
okay? so potentially you are going to hit that 32 500, but it is a range
and best scenario here, you know, the best example, sorry, that i can explain to you on this chart is what happened back here in january
let me just zoom in here on the four hourly and go straight here
in december yesterday i was talking about this example where, you know, it's very, very similar
it's not the same, but this is the kind of deal that i am looking for on bitcoin, right? let me just show you
okay? because there's going to be a lot of people bullish as soon as bitcoin starts trading up 315 32 000
and this we're going to start facing a big, big resistance level like i just showed you here with the vpvr with the resistance here that we have had with uh um, the major weekly um level
okay, the major weekly level here that i do have in the orange
and if i take a look at what happened in december, very, very similar, where you did create this dead cat bounce, you created this lower high over here, and you had a consolidation
and it is true, you might think, at this point, you think, you know, we're gonna come down and fill this wick
but then you have a pretty nice, you know, a relief rally to gain the last lower high, which is this one
and you have an insane swing failure pattern just right over here
you have the last lower highs, as you can see, at the same level, last lower highs at the same level
so that is where we're going to find the potential trading opportunities
if you do break up, you will potentially come down and retest
and on the first touch, very likely you're going to get a bounce
then you might create a lower high, or whatever, or a double top, or you might even break resistance, but i think it's unlikely
i think, you know, potential rejection from this zone is very likely just a liquidity grab, and back down we go
and this is, you know, the best example we could get here is what happened in december of 2021, as you can see
so you break the last lower high, probably a lot of people getting very, very bullish
you know, you think, okay, we're breaking the last lower high
you only get liquidity from the last lower high of this major, big drop, and back down we go
um, so it's something very, very, something very similar could happen, in my personal opinion
and you can just add up the confluence, the value very high from this zone
we got the last lower high, okay, from the big, major drop, this one over here is round about the 32 000 range
and you have that weekly level at that 317, 318, okay, that major weekly level
it's the weekly close and open from the 12th and the 19th of july, right over here
i haven't done hardly any trading on bitcoin this week? i mean, i haven't done any trading for the last four or five days on bitcoin
you can do that range trading, because we're bouncing beautifully from 28 600 and from 30 hundred
but yeah, range trading, you know, longing the the bottom here and shorting this range
but there will be a moment very, very soon, 24 48 hours maximum, in my personal opinion, we are going to see that spike up, or we are going to see that spike down
these are, i'm just showing you transparently, the opportunity levels for me
the people watching is is, again, the more people watching at this moment
and let me just ask you here right away in the comment section, because i think this is super important
i really want to know, do you think that the dxy, do you think that the dxy is going to lose value in the next coming months? all right, next coming weeks, months
this is why, if bitcoin does drop from this level right now, and the dxy continues dropping, it's going to be looking pretty good for bitcoin
so i want to know, guys, are you bearish? do you think the dxy will go to lower levels the coming months? let me know, guys, in the poll that i am riding right now
the xy due for a correction? yes, it does look like, you know, it has been going pretty parabolic
i, you know, i've been talking about this the last few days, and, you know, it's been going pretty parabolic here
as you can see, the higher lows have been going quite aggressive
we did see these bearish diversions, pretty aggressive bearish divergence here, as you can see on the chart
okay? it's not the best tool, but it does help to find out, you know, this potential, potential tops or bottoms on on different assets
and when you go parabolic, and you do see these bearish diversions on the four hourly
um, so, yeah, let's see what happens the next coming weeks on the dxy
i think the dxy from this range could potentially drop, losing major support levels
yes, we could have a rebound here for a potential double top scenario, but it's, it's losing its peg right now
um, let me just go here, quickly through the comment section, say hello to the community
um, because, yeah, i would love to buy bitcoin down at those levels, no doubt about that
how many people wants to buy bitcoin at 24k? um, yeah, i guess a lot of people
how are you doing? i'm in some weekly options for mara, so kinda need help seeing where bitcoin will go
i predict 24k on last time, but i'd if in a week, i missed, i missed up
i'm not sure what i understand this last bit that you said, but, um, yeah, 24k
of course, it does look like, if we do break this zone, uh, a big, massive capitulation could happen
why are we at capitulation levels? how do you know this? why did you come with this idea that we are in a capitulation level? well, currently, the world, you know, economy, the world is not looking absolutely too great
you know, a lot of people might have think, you think that this is kind of a double top, and we are at the extreme support levels where we could, just, if we do break the zone also, and i showed you on on another video not too long ago, where look at the gap that there is from the volume profile
the value area low, from the volume traded in between 2021 and 2022
look at the gap that there is in between thirty thousand dollars and twelve thousand dollars
looking at the vpr, i mean, the vp, i mean twelve thousand, ten, twenty ten, twelve thousand dollars
i don't know if bitcoin is going to go down there, but if it does, it's gonna be an opportunity of a lifetime, that is no doubt
it's gonna be a quick, there's going to be quick price action
it might be a few days, a couple of week, weeks, but the bounce from that level is going to be huge
i'm not sure if we're going to go down there, but just like i showed you with many other cryptocurrencies, when you have a big gap from a volume profile, okay, you know, you see the volume very, very low, you've got some spikes
you've got one at 19 000 where you could get a big bounce at 19 000 if you were to break this um
you know, there's this support level, successfully, we're holding it right now, just getting those wicks, getting that volatility
but the, you know, look how fast we came up from twelve thousand dollars to thirty thousand dollars
and, you know, it could take eight to nine weeks also, the the same timing to go up
we have seen this in many other assets, when you see the volume, a big gap in the volume profile
or is that a bullish pennant? uh, it's some kind of triangle forming
you could arguably discuss, you could arguably discuss that this is a bear flag or a pennant
of course, these are usually, you know, continuation patterns
of course, there is slightly higher probability and breaking down if it comes from a big downtrend
i mean, something interesting here of what i just said, um, is, you know, this bear flag, right? this is also a huge bear flag on the daily, on the weekly
and the this technical textbook, technical analysis breakdown
from this point would be taking us round about that 12 000 region
you know, price action has moved fast from twelve thousand dollars, to thirty thousand dollars
i hope you guys got some stable coins, just in case we do have a black swan event, and we do have a big, massive crash all down to that 12 000 range on bitcoin
don't feel sad about it if that happens, because it's going to be an opportunity of a lifetime, in my personal opinion, for the next coming years
um, i'll be, you know, far off, well, much more than than the last cycle
if that does happen, for the next cycle, we'll be accumulating much more bitcoin and other cryptos
how are you doing, david? how are you doing? what's up? ladies and gents? uh, good morning
let's take a look at solana, because, you know, solana has a very, very important level
i want to talk about also the s p 500 and dax 30, if you will allow me
okay, if you will allow me, i would like to take a look at these um the markets also
let's take a look at solana, because is solana going to manage to hold this range? and this is the big question
there might be a huge consolidation area at these, at this 40, 40 area
this 40 area might be a huge consolidation level, because it's been the highs here from back in summer of 2021
uh, this consolidation has been for, you know, what was it, four, five months, approximately about four months here of consolidation
you know, the big, just look what i was talking about on bitcoin, about the vpvr
look at the gap there is on the vpvr, from this low level value area, low till the next big, big, big spike
there's one here just under twenty thousand dollars, but the biggest one is that twelve thousand dollars
just to explain how the movement to the upside can be as fast to the downside once you have no volume profile
and you have it here on solana, on the four hourly chart, let me just go here to, sorry, on the daily chart here on solana
this is the best example that i could give you right now, just because i put this chart up here
it jumped from 40 all the way here to 80 in less than one week
if we do lose 40, we're coming down to this 40 range, and it's going to be fast
this is why, the possibility of bitcoin breaking, you know, if it does break down this range, and we need to see some bad news worldwide, it can potentially have a pretty fast drop in weeks to these low levels
so what i think on solana is that solana could have a big, kind of dead cat bounce in the next coming days from this area
i think we're not going to successfully break down from this level
first we it looks like that we need a kind of big relief rally, doesn't it? we need a bounce
and then, of course, you can continue, all right, for potentially more downside and a retest again, of this 40, 40 range
we might be creating a kind of a double bottom in the next coming days
look how many times we have bounced as resistance, as support
okay? we would be hitting the 50 fibonacci also, from this high to the lows here
but this range could be also, you know, a bit of volatility, a double top and potential big rejection from that range
taking a look at the fib level here, from the high to the low
if you do get that relief rally, of course, i would be looking for shorts, big spike on the vpvr at this range
of course, we need to take a look at what bitcoin could potentially do
my take on here, if bitcoin does drop from this range, i think we will be holding the 27, 28 000 for a potential double bottom, higher low right over here, and then big bounce to the upside, especially if the dxy does continue having this downtrend
dxy looking absolutely phenomenal with this um, with this drop that it is having at this at this moment, looking pretty, pretty good
because if you take a look at the dxy, you know, it has been holding pretty nicely the the higher lows, right? the higher low range bouncing as, you know, as support, you know, as you can see here, higher low bouncing
trump will finish it sooner than biden, says stock uh, biden dragging his balls
green market or red? well, we do have some pretty interesting news
at 20 baht, 20 past six central european time, we have powell, okay, who's going to be doing some talking
there's definitely going to be a some, some kind of volatility at 20 past six central european time
and also, at 8, 8 o'clock, we have legard, the president of the central european bank talking at eight o'clock also today
so that is, uh, we could definitely see some volatility, uh, this evening, central european time
i mean, this is a thing, we could have a very fast recovery on the dxy
but so far it looks, you know, i think if we are breaking this trend line support level, you know, a potential big recovery, and then a retest of the of the support creating potentially another higher, higher high right there
uh, hitting this trend line, and that will be the moment that we might see a a correction
you know what happens with parabolic things? it has an immediate crash back down
okay, so this is something that is going to happen on the dxy in the next coming months
will it be this month, probably? will it be in the next four months? i do not know
it will happen before the end of the year where we see a pretty aggressive correction
it's not going to, it's just not going to happen very, very lightly, um, especially inflation out of control, of course
we are thinking bitcoin will make a big move, but it's just going sideways still
um, this is the thing, this is the next thing i am looking for bitcoin
i haven't been doing any trading this, uh, these last few days on bitcoin, no trading at all
and i am looking for that, you know, move up or and this is a huge level, guys, 32 000
so this is the i've explained it at the beginning of the video
if you are interested in trading, guys on buybit, you do have the best bonus that there is available for all, for experienced traders, up to four thousand and fifty dollars with a bonus and 30 days of free fee
and on primix bt, i am doing some bit of trading on primix bt
also, you do have seven percent added to your deposit with the link down below in the description
i have both full tutorials of buybit and primexpt down below in the description, so you can learn how to use the platforms properly
we did successfully create a higher low here for the moment, and i think we're gonna, we are forming a descending broading wedge
and i think we probably could have a breakout of this resistance level in the next coming weeks
you can see here this major, big support level at the 15 000 points, getting those bouncers at this range
we actually came back up, retested it to perfection here for resistance and getting that big, you know, crash down
but not only that, it was a value area low from this volume traded between the 9th of april, uh in between april of 2021 to february of 2022, it was the value area low
and you can see here how this is why it's such an important level on the vpvr
once you break down, you come back up, you retest that value area low
not only that, you've got volume profile, you've got support levels, and you've also got from the alltime high here, you would say, you know, fibonacci retracement from the high here to the ultimate low level
you know, what fibonacci level do? you hit to perfection and get that retracement
that was a must, get into a short there, because there's so much confluence that, you it's a short position
and what happened on the other side? you get that correction, thinking that you are going to retest the lows here
but guess where you got that bounce? guess where you got that this is this higher low
where do you get this higher low? let me just show you right away with fibonacci, the lows to the highs
fibonacci from the lows to the highs to perfection, getting that bounce
so this is why i do think, you know, there is a possibility that we actually going to go to higher levels
i know stock market is not looking absolutely great, but, yeah, i'm just going a little bit with the technicals here, going a little bit with technicals
and i do think that, you know, potentially, we are forming this descending, brawning wedge, and we are going to have, uh, a break up here, retest the highs and even go to higher levels and potentially form this bearish gartley pattern
so i am a little bit bullish in the immediate short term with um, with the um, yeah, with dax, with the dac, with the german stock market
and this means that also s p 500, i talked about the scenario of the s p 500, potentially getting that rally to about four thousand two hundred, four thousand two hundred, uh? four thousand one hundred, four thousand two hundred points
there's a potential shark, bearish shark pattern that could take us all the way up there, and then get that big correction
i think we are going to get this bounce after this consolidation, and we're potentially going to go as high as 40 us
you know, what will we what will he say? what is power going to say? let me just go here through the the poll one second
do you think the dxy will go to lower levels the coming months? 66 of people are saying yes
it was strangely alert enough, yesterday, about 65 percent of people were saying, no, that the dx y was looking bullish
so, yeah, maybe a lot of people think, you know, a lot of people right now thinking that it's looking bearish
you can see this kind of parabolic run here with a higher lows
we're losing the last higher low and having that correction right now
uh, the longer markets stay low, the more i can buy crypto winter
um, the thing is, so many people now are understanding, yeah, yeah
and this is why there is a possibility for the markets having an absolutely insane, huge crash, an absolute collapse, because there's still, you know, there's still, um, this kind of bullish sentiment, right? there is still this um, people thinking that, you know, that yeah, we're gonna buy lower
you know, what happens if we do have an insane collapse down to ten thousand dollars? will you be bullish? will you be happy? will you be happy? let me will you be happy? will you be happy? if bitcoin, and, you know, if bitcoin goes down to 12k, imagine all coins
will you be happy if bitcoin goes to 12 k levels? let me know guys in the comment section
i would be really happy, because i got a bunch of stable coins, and i want to get rid of them
if you are buying all coins for 10k, what would you it be now? says nevada, never
they have insane technology that will be used in the next coming years
and this is only my personal opinion, but, yeah, if i were to be buying some projects, i would be go i would be going, of course, with bitcoin and ethereum
ethereum is the pipeline for for defy, for all of these projects being built
this is why this fear, you know, people were not trusting and tara luna was one of those top 10, you know, projects
what happened? well, of course, i would go with the totally legit ones where most of the projects have are being built on
you might 10x, also with bitcoin, in the next next five to 10 years
isn't that good enough for you? well, then, of course, you need to scroll down
i think polka dot will do extremely well, also avalanche l ones
and i'll be focusing, of course, on, you know, l2s, such as polygon, such as metas, such as loop ring, we're looking for layer twos for ethereum
ethereum is still going to be here, and ethereum needs help with transactions
of course, this could come back down, but, you know, here you can, you can see how, you know, these l2s are extremely important
it has been the the second one, okay, in the last 24 hours to gain a high percentage value
and in the last seven days, you know, it's also the second one here
it's had a little bit of a massive hype the last couple of years
it just needs a nice, long correction, sideways action, and i think it will have another insane run in the next ball phase
of course, if you want to speculate more, you need to go to much lower market capitalization
axis infinity is one of those gaming projects that will recover nicely in, in my opinion, in the next big bull phase
i think we could actually come as low as the highs of 2021, if we do lose this support level where we just got this bounce ten dollars is on the way
we did get about from this range, as you can see on the chart
we are forming a kind of a bearish penance here on axe infinity
will we, will we get a balance from this range and continue up, potentially
all depending on bitcoin, of course, and the rest of the crypto markets
what's up? my tether legend says, bernie, how are you doing? xrp, let's take a look at xrp
xrp, what's going on with xrp? what a shame for all of the for the xrp army, because xrp is struggling a lot
xrp did create a huge symmetrical triangle here, and it's broken down, and it's going down heavily right now at this moment
can it come to lower levels? it can come as low as the 20 cent range easily
but if you are bullish on xrp, that 20 cent level, no doubt in my mind, is going to be a huge, huge um accumulation zone
we have been trading in between 20 cents and 40 cents from 2018 till, you know, the beginning of 2021, even, you know, this is how it's been such a poor performer
and i think, you know, xrp, there is a possibility, you know, xrp lows
if you ask me, where is the bottom for xrp, i'm, i would say in between 20 cents and 40 cents
reason why is because the huge amount of uh, time that we have had in between 20 cents and 30 cents, back in 2018 and until 2021, over three years trading at this range
it's just very unlikely you're gonna, you're gonna, you know, you're gonna go to 10 cents, five cents
ever, again, if the bear market lows, here was about 15, 40 cents from this the the march of 2020 crash
once or twice, i got into a long position, very successful along here
and technical analysis is is just not not good for me on on xrp, it's too volatile, by the looks of things here
on xrp, i think there is a possibility that we are going to retest the lows here
with these lower, lower highs, it looks like that retest from the lows here of about 33 cents
when btc hits 100k, xrp will be worth two to five dollars, maybe 10, says felipe
why not? gmt has been um, an insane cryptocurrency to give me a huge profits
now, let's take a look here one second on, um, hang on a second, guys
what's going on with gmt? first of all, we've been talking about gmt, about this major resistance level of the 170
but look how insanely we, we touched this 17075 range as support
we got a beautiful bounce from the highs of march of 2020, sorry, 2022, uh, march here
and, yeah, the last calls that we were talking about on gmt was this 170, 175 range
you know, this area over here getting huge resistance because it's been a major level, you know, beautifully getting that, um, these these corrections on gmt
now, what could happen on gmt? well, we know that this is a very big level
once you break the 130 range, 125, 130, big su successful breakdown
the first three tests, will very likely get a rejection the first one
be careful, because you might get a double bottom right there, or you might have a, don't get into the second retest
if you missed out the first retest of a breakdown, you don't get in the second one, because you could break it back up again
but first one, you look at this huge major level already confirmed, the 130
if you successfully break the 130, the first retest on the one hourly chart, four hourly, all depending on, you know, what time frame you're looking at
but in between one hourly and four hourly, first retest, it is a must
it is a much short just like what happened here, first retest, it's a must get in here
if we do have a solid breakdown, i will be looking for that, for that retest of this major region, very similar to what happened here
if we do have a successful breakout with volume, i will be looking for that trade
now, what else? if we successfully break out the 170, we do break this 170 area with a nice four hourly solid level
okay? very likely we'll be getting rejected from this high range
definitely getting rejected from this range, in my opinion, the 170
there's going to be major levels where we are going to get beautiful bounces, where you could get, you know, you can make some huge profits
you do not know if you're going to pump here or you're going to dump
guys, remember you got an insane bonus down below, four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus to claim in the rewards hub
of course, you need to follow the steps of the rewards hub to claim the four thousand fifty dollars
you're not you could not deposit a hundred dollars and expect they're going to give you four thousand and fifty dollars

if you have signed up with my link in the description in the past, and you have over 10 usdt, you can get this airdrop
are we going to go to lower levels? it's having a pretty aggressive drop at this moment
let's take a look at bitcoin cash here, where he's bitcoin cash here
okay, also from this kind of ascending channel, right? we didn't have this ascending channel situation
bitcoin dropped from, uh, the the first week of may, big aggressive drop here
this is, you know, this is the difference in between all coins
um, yeah, just imagine if bitcoin were to be trading at the march 2020 lows, uh, yeah
this is how, this is the big difference in between all coins and um and bitcoin, of course, bitcoin much stronger, much more solid
of course, diminishing returns, but you already made over a 10x if you did invest in 2020, in march of 2020, over a 10x on bitcoin
and bitcoin cash is trading at those levels, march of 2020 levels, which is absolutely insane
where's bitcoin cash here? absolutely crazy, crazy, trading out march 2020 levels
of course, you know, how much lower can bitcoin cash go if you are trading at, you know, 2019, 2020 levels? yeah, potential bottom
so if you are bullish in bitcoin cash, this might be an accumulation zone

see what big major levels where i am going to be trading this on bitcoin
you can actually short resistance, long support till you have that break out
and i'll explain in in the beginning of the livestream, what is my trading plan here for bitcoin
on the poll here, will you be happy if bitcoin goes to 12k levels? and 55 of almost 200 votes say yes
so people will be happy if if we go as low as 12k? 45 say, you know, so, yeah
davo, joseph mark durch, guys, thank you very much for the insane support my moderators community
how are you? is everyone feeling good today? rash viktor indra, hello
how are you? aisha, what? how do you pronounce that? aisha, hello
how are you guys? if you have not already liked the live stream, please go inside and do that
we're going down to the targets to where i do expect us to come back down to
overall, i still believe that we will come back down to 1 400, around that level
i don't understand why you guys are long on bitcoin when bitcoin is going down
um, i do expect that we will continue to be bearish, because looking at these candlestick and look at the the momentum that we do have, i think that we definitely will come back down now to 1700
well, like even if the market goes up, the market will show up, show us if it's gonna go up
i'm gonna go down to the lower time frames also, because when we have the momentum at the moment it is usually, is usually on the lower time frames you you need to go to
give me one second and i'll do the most important thing ever when it comes to the lower time frames
is there anyone in short positions? or is everyone going along? is everyone going along? i wanna go
okay, so i'm gonna go to, i'm gonna go to dxi before we dive into the chart
natalie, can you explain what the vertical line is? no, matt, i can't, i can't
so, uh, we were talking about this, i think it was on the, on the previous live stream yesterday that we did have, um, i was expecting the market on dxi to drop
and that is, i do base that on that we can come back down to create a higher low
but let's see, we had, we do have a pretty strong momentum at the moment
so we also came back up and retested this low, the the the previous support we did break and retest that almost
so i definitely believe so if uh, dxi pull back down to these levels, this is where i expect the market to, uh, break to the upside
so that is why it's really good that we go into dxi before we go into bitcoin and ethereum, because with that confirmation, it's always good having extra confirmations before going to the charts and looking at the overall
so we drop, we did drop back down to the support, add to twenty eight thousand seven hundred and fourteen
um, so we're just gonna wait and see now if we will respect this, if we will respect this
um, i'm gonna turn my phone off if we're gonna respect the support
um, but one thing that we can do to see that we we will use another trend line like this
i'm also going to use the previous lower high that we do have at 29 hundred
so two things, either we see the market pull back, of three things
either we see the the market on bitcoin pull back up 229, 320, for then just might pull back down a little bit more, break the the support that we are retesting now, retest continuation
or if we see the the pullback to the upside, i still want to see the market break this resistance trend line, also the previous lower high, to create a higher high
and then i'll try to see if i can find a a buy opportunity on the higher low
i'm not, i'm not, i'm not saying that we will reverse to the upside and bitcoin will, you know, reach 100k tomorrow
we're still inside the support and resistance zone, so you just might see the market pull back up and then see the drop
but the four hourly candle that that will close in one hour and 15 minutes
so i'm, i'm gonna do the same thing with the vertical lines that i'm not talking about
and the people, the one that taught me, i respect him very much
and i'm not giving out things for free when it's not what i came up with
so i do that by respect to those people, because i know how hard some people
i know exactly how hard people work when they back test and they figure things out
and i'm not gonna take his work and share that freely, because that that is me disrespecting him
because i know who i know how he is, and i just need to respect that
what's terrible, respecting other people's work? it's not terrible
yeah, i know, you know the smoking gel, but how to use them, it's another thing
if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so we can reach out to more people, and you can help me grow the channel
if you want to learn something, you take your time and and you back test it
i was moving yesterday to another apartment, and i was so tired this morning
but, uh, lauren, if you want to send them the if you want to send them the the chat
so if you want to be in contact with me and all of the other beautiful people that, um, follow me on uh, you guys, my subscribers, i do have a bitcoin census community chat where we talk about cryptocurrencies and just show each other respect
so if you want to be part of that, you can more than, you're more than welcome
uh, yes, laurel uh, laura, just put the chat, uh, in the in the live stream chat, so you can just go in there
you must be happy that you found someone of your own kind, right? okay, so look at the lower time frames right now on bitcoin
so if we break above, if we break above 29 040 with a clear breakout and retest from above, that could take us back to higher targets
if we see that, we come back down a little bit, and then we see another retest
and depending on how the candlestick is looking at those, uh, levels, if we say rita's from below, that, for me, is another entry to go short on bitcoin, um
but i also want to have in mind how dxi is looking, because we have such a huge candlestick to the downside on dxi
so i would not be surprised that we start to see some, it was some bullish momentum to the upside
i'm not telling, i'm not saying that we will have this huge movement is that's not what i talk about
but because we come with we we are, we're coming back down to a support [Music]
you said when dxi and bitcoin trends opposite all the time, but this is not happening
if we see the break of 29 035, break rita's from above, that, for me, is a sign that we will have a bigger pullback to the upside
so we're just going to wait and see what what the market will do
and until then, and yeah, also, if we break below 28 660, breakup retest, that could be the beginning of, uh, that we see more momentum to the downside
so right now, we're just gonna wait and see where the market respects
and by that, we just, i'm just gonna take the decisions what to do
and then you can tell yourself, because natalie says, we're going, what do you talk about? are you talking about me being a noob? anyone else wondering when nat is throwing a housewarming party? yeah, soon
ethereum, so, okay, so we are below the trend line that we also did break
so i want to see how, i want to see how ethereum will work against it
um, we just might see, if we, say, pull back to 90, 1940, potentially to 1946, and we see bearish, uh, reversals around these levels, that could definitely be us, uh, see more momentum to the downside
so the same thing now, i'm just gonna put the alert to see if we come back up and retest these levels for a lower high on the lower time frames and then a break
because if we look at the lower time frames, we have such a big candlestick on the four hourly charts
and what you see, uh, what we see is that on this candlestick, on the lower time frames, this is only pullback
so when you have this huge candlestick, and this is the candlestick that is about to break the support trendline, which is also very important if you're close above it
because when you, when you see a huge candlestick like this, for example, i'm gonna show you how it looks
so when you see this huge candlestick right here, that's the same box
and that's the same thing when you see this volatile candlestick, you also see the pullback right here
so that is why it's really important how to combine how you need to learn
i mean, i'm not gonna tell you what to do, but it's, it's very important to learn what happens inside huge candlesticks like this on the lower time frames
uh? so that is why i'm looking for the pullback on the lower time frames, right here, on the 15 minutes chart
and this four hourly candle, this four hourly candle, um is closing in one hour and two minutes
on the one hourly, we also see a retest of it, and we're closing in one minute and 47 seconds
another week with nat god, what'd i do wrong? anyways, hey, hey, this man
how are ya? but even if we see that we have a little more push to the upside, another thing that we can do is that we drag the fibonacci from 1974 back down to the low at 1928
so that could be the pullback, and then see the reverse back down
so when this we have one new candlestick that opens now in 54 seconds
so let's see where we can how that looks on the lower time frame
so if we pull back up to these levels, that is also a support that we did break before
so remember, a preview support can become a new, a new resistance
grgr are you disrespecting me on the on the on the live stream? don't do that
do people really have to tell you, be polite? do grown up does grownass people have to tell other people to to behave? come on, stop it
okay, can you see how perfectly we did retest this level? so okay, just wait and see
trading view will give me an alert if you come back up and retouch these levels
if you are new to the channel, don't forget to subscribe to it and hit the notification so you know when i am live or do have my daily updates
so i'm trying to combine the candlestick and see what happens on the lower time frame
i do have morning live sessions every single morning from monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time, so one hour before london session open, so we can go in and have an overview, uh, over the day
you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
it is super good if you want to hold a position for a longer time
so, yeah, now, you know, let's see what you guys want me to go through
um, okay, let's see where, what type of coins you want me to look at? i saw aave
don't you enjoy it? i'm gonna try to see if i find my, like, the best music of loafy, because they're so good
so we're looking at the higher time frames because we can see that the market is pulling back up, right? and we did break the previous support at 115 um
going to the lower time frames, what i try to do is that i try to calculate where the um, where the fibonacci, is
so i drag it from 159, 160, not why don't you put the fib on the floor, i will candle from the top to the low, because i don't do that
yeah, no, i think i've explained this for a couple a couple of times
you can also drag it back up to, okay, we're going to do it like this
so if we see that aav pull back up to potentially 116 and potentially 129, this is where i expect the market to continue to drop
obviously some coins are bullish, but i do believe a pullback to these levels, and that could be a beginning to the downside
we have a support trendline that we are respecting at the moment
so if we say that we break this resistance trend line, um in a potential retest from above, that could be the beginning back up to to higher targets
and based on that, dxi right now is very bearish, this could be where we start to see a bigger pullback
can you see how perfectly the market came back down and retested the fibonacci level? it's perfect
but if we see that aave will break 98, dallas break, it retest continuation
and i can almost guarantee that, if that is the case, we will drag another um
we will drag another uh, fibonacci from the low to the high, and depending on where the high is, obviously
but that will also give us fibonacci targets to potentially um, put a buy limit order at it
but first of all, we need to break above, uh, nine to eight or so
if we break, if we see that this four hourly candle that is closing in, uh, 50 minutes, you just might see them if you close below it, that could be a sign that we see the market continue back down
so a lot of things depends on how this candlestick is closing
it's pretty boring when we it's pretty boring when we are in a sideways market
so that's why it's really important to understand what type of market we look at
if it's gonna affect the charts a little bit, i think so, but not too much
okay, craig, we're gonna, i'm gonna show you what i see right now on kodio gmt, yes to mention
okay, so looking at korea, we came back down to this previous supporter, this this resistance support
and that is between two point two thousand eight hundred and forty four and one point six thousand six hundred and thirty
so we're coming back down to a previous kind of support, resistance zone
so on the lower time frames, what we do is that we just try to figure out what potentially can happen
and we came back up and retested it yesterday, but we never had the power to break it
so what we're going to do is that we're just going to adjust it a little bit and see what's happening
okay, so if we see we came back down to the support, and obviously this is what happens, that when you come back down to such a strong support, you see the market pull back up
because if we, if we use the fib from this previous lower high at four point two thousand one hundred and fifty to the low at one point five thousand nine hundred and fifty seven, you came back up exactly to the fibonacci levels right here
so this is what we look for in the higher time frames, fibonacci
we look for to see, can you see how beautiful the market is, bouncing in between the the the fibonacci levels, and then it decides to break
and on the lower time frames, you can obviously do the same thing
so we saw the market giving us another little pullback, [Music], and we came back
so we dragged the fibonacci from three point two thousand seven hundred and thirty seven back down to the low at two point one thousand seven hundred and sixteen
and then you saw the the break of it go down to the lower time frames, just to see, yeah
and if we would have dragged, because you can see that this is a pretty messy chart
it's pretty, it's pretty hard to trade in market if you don't, at least for me, if i don't understand, um, where i am
we know that we came back up and retested at 50, and then, you slowly, instead, it saw the market starting to break down
you saw the break you saw the retest, and then you saw the drop
if we come back up now, when we test two point three thousand five hundred and uh, forty, or potentially two point three hundred and, uh, two point three thousand eight hundred and six, that could be where we see the market pull back down again
but if that is the case, i'm not financial advisor, but take profit one would be two point one thousand two hundred
take profit three, one point nine thousand two hundred and seventy three
but if we start to see more momentum to the upside, and we break inside of the support trend line that we did break, that could take us to higher targets, um where i mean, we will first of all, come back up and retest this high at point six thousand two hundred
if we break that level, that could take us to, that could be the confirmation that we're actually heading, uh, having a bigger pullback to the upside than expected
one, one, one, please drop one, one, one in the chat if you do
what was that? uh, gmt, gmt, usdt, and you said that we did break a support
can you have a look at it? um, do you have the numbers? do you have the numbers for, uh, the key support that you that you were talking about? uh, thanks again for taking a look at kadena
uh, what takes you five minutes to try it out? would take me all day
when you do some the same thing over and over again, and you become a noob or a nerd, everything is just practice
we drag fibonacci from one point eight two thousand two hundred and forty eight back down to the low at one point one thousand sixteen thousand five hundred three
but by looking at the charts, and on the higher time frames, like we just have so many candlestick that is just telling us that we're going down
it's only on the lower time frames that the market, that the market is giving us a bullish momentum, but that is only because on the lower time frames we have the pullback
we can either take the the fibonacci from one point forty thousand five hundred and thirty eight, or to the low at one point thirty eight thousand two hundred and ninety
so we're gonna start off with the smallest one to see how market will behave around it
and if i see the market push back up to one point thirty four thousand nine hundred and fifteen, or potentially one point thirty five thousand seven hundred and forty three, that, for me, could be the sign that we're actually creating the lower high on the lower time frames
because remember, on the lower time frames you see the pullback
on the higher time frames, you have this four hourly candlestick that is very volatile
um, the last higher low on the on the on the one hourly chart was as at 1140 180
we broke that level, created the lower high market comes back down to create a lower low
so do we create another lower high for then drop lower? that's what i that's what i see
and if, and even if the market is, you know, from nowhere, reversing back up, i'm not going to go into a buy position just because i see that
because if i would go into a buy position, we need to break this trend line right here
i would break, i i if i would go into a by position, even if i see the market, you know, having more momentum, you create higher highs and higher lows
if we just might only come back up to one point for the nine thousand six hundred and eighty four, then see the drop
you as i told you, if i would buy, i would want the market to break that level, retest it from above, and then see the continuation
but, but, i think, i, i understand, but i talked for the people who who maybe think that the market is bullish, that's the thing
you see what you see, but that's what i i definitely believe that
so the key level we came back down, and rita's at thirty thousand seven hundred and fifty
i'm sorry if i take long on every cat, on every uh coin right now, but it's just that i just want to go through it in detail
i know that a lot of you want to have the prices, but i think it's important that you also understand what i see and why i see it, for your own sake, so when you sit at the chart yourself, you can remember that, oh, yeah, natalie said this
so the so, so the support that we did break at one point, thirty four thousand one hundred and sixty four, is a very important one
if you haven't already subscribe for more to my channel, go inside and do that
i do have daily updates about cryptocurrencies, every single day, seven days a week
is there anyone on this live stream that usually is on my back testing? uh, studies
and please give me some feedback, because it's been a couple of days ago
have you practiced it yourself? give me some feedback, because i want to see, do you want me to continue to do these back test live streams together with you, or you don't care about them? just give me some feedback so i know what what you like
because i definitely, i mean, you can see that the views is really good now, at 24k, it's really good
during this live stream, i put the chat into like, five minutes
you cannot, you cannot write anything for between five minutes because we just want to focus so much, or i want to focus so much on the charts
so i don't want anything to kind of interrupt me, um, because it's a really important time when you back test it
and so it's more like like, you know, take your coffee with you, have your notes, uh, also, and just study with me
and it's so, it's so great to see so many people all around the world that we can, that i can do this together with
i remember when i started to trade, i was just back testing alone
and i i actually find it very, very, i do enjoy it very much to share that with you, because i know how hard, i know how tough it can be
so i can definitely continue to have my back testing live stream
so, yeah, and guys, don't also forget that for me being able to sit here and share my thoughts and knowledge with you, you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to forty four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
but bitcoin, but by bit, is also the super great platform to have your positions for a long time with very low fees, like, very low fees
i love i i thought pipe it was a little bit complicated in the beginning, but because that was also because i was used to other platforms
but i do love that you also have everything on the same chart
and you can also see exactly, when you see, when you put a trade, uh, because it's never trading
but you you see exactly how much yours, how much you're willing to lose, and how much you're willing to, uh, to win
so that is also something that i definitely love when it comes to vibe, is that you can, you see exactly, um, what you what you want to lose, or how much you want to go in profit, before you push the sell or buy button
i have already figured out your fav feb, just have to make some modification
with me, i'm like, yeah, were you talking about to mesh up? you're not talking to me
a, b, b, we can go to b b, because i saw that someone wrote that in the beginning when you wanted me to look at your peers
even you don't have strong clickbait, but you grow faster than the ones you do, because the volume content that we can chill and learn from
maybe one day you will also sit in front of youtube and share your thoughts, do you guys? so, um, sorry, not talking
i was thinking about you two talking to each other, i said many times
i just saw, i remember that i saw b and b in the beginning, and also, jasmine ray, sorry
and so i'm gonna, i'm gonna try to make it fast now, because all of the other periods are kind of looking the same
so one thing that i'm gonna do, i think that sultan, new subscriber
i'm gonna go, i think i will go to england in september, because i'm gonna, it's an artist called londrel who's gonna play, and if there's anyone from england in this live chat, and we i we could definitely do like, a meet up, like a bunch of us, if you are from this live uh, from my youtube channel
just maybe rent a place to be at and then just go through the charts live together
okay, so b and b, we're to go through this so everyone can have their pairs looked at
on the weekly chart, we came back down to the support, uh, we broke a previous support at 300 and, uh, the 350
but one thing that we can do, so this is usually how i do it, to try to figure out if these levels are in, uh, important
so we drag the fibonacci, i use fibonacci all the time, because fibonacci is the best thing ever
and this 618 percent is slightly below the support that we did break
so i definitely believe that we can have a push back up to potentially 335 or potentially 354
so if you see slippage, you see the market try to break it comes back inside
but just remember that it is around these levels we do expect the market to do
you see, we've already retested it fifty percent very quickly
okay, so either we see the market push back up again, or we actually see the market break below it, potentially
it's so hard to sit and say to you now on the live stream, all this will happen, this will not happen, because obviously the market does whatever it's supposed to do, and our only job is to follow it and see what's actually going to happen
so if i'm not looking at the charts to get with you, when i end the live stream and you're like, hey, what's gonna happen? so so many things that can happen
um, from the support you'll either see the market break it, give you a lower low, come back up for a lower high, and then you see the market potentially break down again, or you see the market tr break it
but the next candlesticks that we'll look at, they are closing inside the support again
see potentially market consolidate, and then you see the drop
so that is why sometimes it's really hard to say that this will happen, because obviously i do not know until you know certain candlesticks has been formed, the the volume of the candlestick, etc
but definitely have in mind that when we come to, especially when it comes to trend lines, because trend lines is 90 percent more respected than support, horizontal support and resistance, uh lines
so always have that in mind when you come to a support, when you come to trend lines, the market can fake you out so easily around them
and yeah, so if we see the market pull back down from these fibonacci levels
but obviously, if we want to put more uh positions, what i usually do, and not what i usually do, but what you can do, always look at the left and see where is the previous low
so if you see the market now pull back down, and you do not know where to have your take profits, just look at the previous lows and have them as take profits
because the market always comes, mark my word when i say that, the market always comes to previous levels where you've seen the market retested it
so if you are unsure how to how to use take profits in a in a downtrend, look at the previous higher lows
so say, for example here, let's say that you buy the market from here, right? you buy the market from here, you're like, natalie, where am i supposed to have my take profits
can you see more? even if it's a tight one, everything depends, like, if you want to have a bigger, stoploss, it's bigger, take profits, etc, or smaller, everything depends
but you could also see right here, if you want to have bigger ones, okay? you buy the market here, take profit where maybe
and then you just might be like, okay, you know what? i'm gonna have this high
and you'll see every time that the market comes always to these levels and retest them in some way, because market is always using previous prices
that is why always look at the left and see where the market kit head to buy
okay, now i'm gonna go to because someone said something before about a coin
so i'm not gonna make people angry now, because i promised assists that we were supposed to go through dot
did we have anything else before that? and then jazz me, natalie should remember her millionaire market factory
and the fun thing is that when you talk about it like the way i do, this is why you i, i'm gonna share something with you
they just gave me this beautiful opportunity to be be part of something great
and with andy and carl's and their view, i just love the opportunity they gave me
but the the most important thing that i also did before was that i, oh, i'm you know, i've been back testing the market so long, but i always spoke
i always spoke to myself, okay, the market is doing this now, the market is doing this
but if you want to practice and become better by just speaking, you will
that will come into your brain, so you will learn more and more and more and more, because you just, you just speak it to your brain, and then everything starts to click
you don't just have to do it and sit quietly talk to yourself about it
as you guys already know, i still believe that we will come back down and fill this wick
um, we can also come back down to the previous resistance that we do have at 55
no problem going to the lower time frames on the so last week we've been, we've been just having huge momentum
but if we see dot pull back up to 1012 or at 1023, these are the levels where i do expect the market to reverse back down from
and that is only if we see the market pull back up to these levels and you start to see rejections
it doesn't have to happen on the one, one hourly chart, but you will definitely start to see that the market slowly instead breaks down
just the same thing that happened here, but this is only on a lower fibonacci
yes, guys, help me to, i we have 175 people that like the live stream
sometimes i should just not talk, but please help me to grow the channel so we can reach out to more people and help them how to look at the charts in a very simple way
if there's 200 likes, that will tell us what those lines are? yes, i will tell you
just saying, okay, looking at uh, jasmine, we are at the low low
guys, if you want to know what the lines are, go inside and like the live stream to 200 people
okay, so in if we don't have 200 people in one minute, so in two minutes, when the clock is 7 46
so what we're gonna do is, that would drag fib from twenty five thousand two hundred and ten back down to, uh, eleven thousand 180
looks like we can have a pullback if we break this resistance trendline that i just, um gave you, if we break that to the upside, that could take us back up to 1, 18 173, potentially 19 836
um, so, yeah, i'm not so, i'm not so positive too, that we will break, you know, and see the huge volatility the upside, though
now, what i do she hunt people with loafing music and no way to escape that it's like her life
i've seen soul requested a lot not oh yeah, i'm gonna look at it
when it comes to the lines that you see on the 15 minutes charts, they are representing the different sessions that we have, london session, new york session, asia session
and if you are new to the channel, don't forget to go inside and subscribe to it
i also have, uh, back trading live streams right together with you
and so, yeah, i'm trying to share as much knowledge i can with you
and the good thing is that what you already know, because i know that a lot of you know many things, but just, it can just, you know, if i say certain things or show you certain things, that can just click with you, because that just might be what you needed
that that happened to me when i found some people that were talking about certain things
i was like, yeah, yeah, i see that, because i already know these things
and and that's what i want you to do, too, because trading is really hard
it's hard to find very good people that actually share, um, their knowledge
and you also have andy, if you, if you haven't subscribed to anna's channel
i also see that he has these morning live streams now from nine o'clock
so he goes one hour after me when i do have my my morning live streams
and you can also receive a bonus on, uh, buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars, but by using the link in the description down below the video
we just might see the pullback now, because the market created a lower low
um, so either we can only come back up and retest the trend line again
and that could then either we see the slowly, instead of the market break to the downside
if that is the case, we can come back down to support again at 47, or back down to 13 offset 40 also
if we only have a quick pullback to the upside, you just might only see the market retesting 5166, or potentially 5226, and then you see the reverse
so we were speaking about this, and we are breaking this level
so what we're gonna focus on now is the resistance trend line that we're breaking
so this is why it's always good to have two we all, we know that you either go up or you either go down, right? so you have the levels to see what happens if the market breaks to the upside
and this is what i spoke about in the beginning of this live stream, is that if we break the previous lower high at 29 313, we're waiting for the market to pull back down to create a high low
because we always buy, or i always buy, try to buy the market at least at the higher lows, and then i go long
even if you see the market pull back up, i'm, i'm just gonna wait for the market to give me a a bearish candlestick, a bearish candlestick, and then see where the uh, where that could take us
because when you see the break of the resistance trend line, what i do is that i drag the fibonacci from the last low to the to the higher high
and [Music] that will be where i look for the market to pull back down to for me to be able to potentially buy the market
so this could be, i mean, we came back down to the support mortgages, might need to come back up and create a higher, lower high
now that doesn't mean, you know, it will go up forever, because we're stealing it
you know, how does it looks on txi, yeah, we're going back, we're reaching the targets down at 101 so on dxi, i do believe that, first of all, what i look at is 101357
we could also see a retest of the 618 percent at 100 points, 620
so we just might see the market come back down to these levels and then break to the upside
because this just might be the higher low being created on bitcoin
then combined with the speed, the the speech that we do have right now, we just, we will also see that the market is pulling back up, right? we just might, uh, let's see the first levels where we can come to
so we just might see the market only pull back up to potentially 2 29 850 now on bitcoin, or potentially 30 045
so can you see that? okay, we i wait for the market to pull back up to these levels for to see the market then reverse back down, right? but on the lower time frames that it gives us a potential short, uh, a sculpting opportunity, depending on where the market gives us the so can you see how beautiful this is, guys? on the five minutes chart now, we just might pull back down to 29 283, or nine thousand two hundred and twenty
and take profit one, take profit two and three is combine, exactly where we could see the market pull back up to to then reverse back down
does it make sense? does it make sense, guys? i'm actually going to put a buy position on by right now
and this is the beautiful thing when it comes to trading, when when the market doesn't respect the levels that you thought it would, you're just changing your mindset with with the game, right? that's, that's the most that's the beauty of it
i was so in love in legolas when i was, when i was younger, but i never wanted to be his sister
same thing on ethereum with drag fibonacci, from 1230 to the high
so we just might, we just might see the market pull back down to 1948, and potentially 1 943
take profit two is one thousand nine hundred and if ninety five, take profit three is two thousand and fifteen
and it is from these levels, on these fibonacci levels between 2000 and 2015, i'll see the market slowly reverse back down
if we not, obviously see the market, you know, pull back up, not like have this volatility to the upside now, and we don't even come back down a retest
egld, who didn't want to be his girlfriend? i guess there's a lot of boys in there that didn't want to be his girlfriend
i'm just gonna do the same thing my computer starts to be slow
if we see the market push back up now, i would look at 9338, maybe also 9694
um egld, we just might pull back down to 9018 or 89 points and 92 for a pullback, and then take profit one could potentially be 91 points, uh, 9176
and it's from these levels that i just might slowly study see the market break down
grgr you were so polite in the beginning, but you're not that rude
how does that feel? how does that feel? what i used to guys, if you are new to the channel, i want to say very, very, very welcome to it
um, i've been, i do trading every single day, or i i work with trading, obviously
i i do this to share my thoughts and, uh, knowledge with you guys
so if you have not subscribed to my channel, please go inside and do that
i do have every single day morning live streams nights nine, uh, sorry, eight am, swedish time, so that is one hour before london session opens
we go through, uh, forex factory in the beginnings to see if we have any news coming out
um, and we just, you know, have the setups, we just have the setups with each other to see what the market will do against them during the day
but put it in your calendar also, because i share some very good things also to you
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
if we look at the weekly we are below the previous low at nine to 93 thousands
can you zoom it in so you don't have to say it every single time? but on the weekly low, on the week, you can see that we do have this low
so it is a strong support that you also saw the market came back up and retesting
i still believe that we will come back down to to this, the weekly low
then we just might see a pullback up to um, eight two, five, nine, five, eight, potentially eight, five, zero, six, nine, four
but if we have just a low pullback, we just might see the, see the pullback to seven, eight, six, eight, eight, seven, or potentially seven, nine, five, eight, two, five
if these, if we break these fibonacci levels, i would look at eight, two, five, four, five, nine and potentially eight, five, one, eight, zero, zero
hello seb, seb, where have you been? oh, we never came back down and activated my trade? or no, we do not
i do believe that we will have a pullback up to, first of all, twenty twenty nine thousand eight, sorry
twenty nine thousand eight hundred and fifty four thirty thousand and forty five
from these levels, i do, i will look to see if we see the market break down again for a potential lower high
but if we break it, we just, i just, you know, we're just gonna look at higher targets
but it actually looks pretty good to see the market pull back up to these levels
i have a buy limit order if we see the market pull back down a little bit
this is where i potentially can see the market pull back down to
natalie, did you not say at the beginning of the stream that bitcoin is going down further? are you trying to make a fool of me? grgr, you know exactly
just as me as they traded that even if the market does go up, and i said the market is going down, you know exactly that
i'm not trying to sit here and say, oh yeah, i say was supposed to go down, and now it goes up, and i'm gonna be ashamed
that's what you want me to be ashamed, that i said that the market is going down, but now it goes up
you want a trophy for that? even if the market goes up, you see how i changed my mindset, right? and that's the good thing being a trader, that you can change your mindset with the market
that is why it's so important that we we use these different support resistance trend lines
because everyone wants to earn money, right? everyone wants to earn money on the charts
you know, people think that they can come to live streams and just be rude and not and when you say something back to it
if i think that it's not okay for you to say that to me, i'm gonna stand my ground, right? stop it now
you know what i think on ethereum, we i do expect ethereum to push back up to 2000 and potentially 2015
and from these levels, i do expect the market to pull back down
if the market is not doing that, less talking, more analyzes, i do what exactly
so, yeah, this is what i look right now on ethereum and a bitcoin
so when the excite is going down, bitcoin and ethereum is going up, etc
thank you so much for everyone that chose to be on this live stream
if i see a comment that i don't like, i will, i will take that, i will say what i need to say, and then i just move on with it
because i don't think it's, i don't think it's fair that people, because people don't do this just to me
they just try to, you know, say nasty things to people, or just think they can say whatever and then just leave it without anyone telling like, hey, what you say is, you know, sometimes it's wrong
don't forget to subscribe to the channel, hit the notification
so, you know, when i'm live, i just might go on another live stream tonight and we do some back testing together
i will not have anyone talking or chatting with me, because we need to focus on the charts
so you say what? you want me to have a regular video, or do you want me to have a back testing live stream? and, uh, you know, i'll pick and choose
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits um up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in description down below the video
but can you admit that your predictions at the beginning on the stream was not on points? [Music]
really? haven't you, like, followed me the whole time from the beginning, i just showed you exactly? and from okay, so i said that the market is going down
and during the live stream, i just told you, hey, i'm buying the market
don't you listen to what i say? it has nothing to do with i'm trying to be right or wrong
thank you so much for everyone that p that that's on this live stream together with me
and where do we have him? where do we have him? mckay, okay, see
my name is josh, and in this video, i'm going to be covering some important bitcoin charts, ethereum chance ethereum versus bitcoin and the stock market today
and usually i'll spread all of this information into two separate videos, usually one bitcoin video and one ethereum video every day
but considering not that much has happened since yesterday, i can squeeze it all into one video, rather than waste your time with two separate videos
so like i said, i'll be covering all of this important information later in this video
first of all, starting off the video on the daily bitcoin chart, and you can see that we still have this bullish divergence, which is active on the chart
and in case you're new to this channel, this just means we're seeing reduced bearish momentum
and obviously we've been experiencing that over the past one week, because during this time we've pretty much just seen choppy, sideways price action after that crash down towards 25k
and considering the fact that we also have another active bullish divergence on the twoday bitcoin chart, and this is also visible on the daily time frame as well, unfortunately, i'm still expecting mostly sideways, chopping price action in the shorter term, talking about the next few days or so, potentially the next one to two weeks, which can be a bit of a boring time in the market, especially if you're a hodler
but if you're a trader, we can potentially develop some sort of sideways price range
and if that's the case, where we're trading between support and resistance during this time period, that was a perfect trading opportunity where you could short bitcoin at resistance and long bitcoin at support, for example
but if you're a complete beginner to bitcoin, i do not recommend trading shortterm fluctuations in the bitcoin price, because that can be risky if you don't know what you're doing
and speaking about shorter term bitcoin price movements, just quickly heading over to the sixhour bitcoin charts to let you know that this symmetrical triangle pattern has now been invalidated, because we've seen a couple candle closes just above this point of resistance, and now we've seen a few candle closes below this previous line of support, which has essentially invalidated this pattern with a fake out
which goes back to what i was just saying about how i'm mostly expecting sideways, choppy price action in the shorter term
and once again, that's pretty much exactly what we are seeing
and as for shortterm resistance and support, we do have some strong resistance at around 307 k, and some strong support at around 286 k, approximately
so these are just the immediate points of support and resistance that i am paying attention to in the shorter term
and if you zoom out to the threeday bitcoin chart, this closely aligns with this range of support, which is coming in at around 28 and a half thousand, up towards 30 000, based on these previous levels of support that we found last year
and so it's very important for the bitcoin price to maintain above that range of support, going down to, once again, around 28 and a half thousand
but if the bitcoin price confirms a break below around 28 000, then it's very likely we could revisit that 25k low
and if that's the case, obviously we'll be entering into this accumulation range on the weekly bitcoin charts, which is set by the 1 000 day moving average, coming in at just above 28 000, and the 200 week moving average, which is coming in at just above 22 000
and historically, this closely aligns with the weekly bitcoin rsi as well
because usually when the bitcoin price enters between these moving averages and gives us an amazing buying opportunity, we also see the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories, which is an extremely rare signal
and in fact, we didn't actually make it down there during that march 2020 crash because of how quick that crash happened
so the weekly bitcoin rsi entering into oversold territories is a signal that i'm still waiting for that we haven't seen just yet
so technically speaking, there's still some room to the downside based on the rsi
but like we saw in early 2020, we don't necessarily have to make it all the way down to oversold territories in order to officially bottom out
and instead, i'm dollar cost averaging heavier at different levels, basically at the current prices at the time of recording this video, at around 29k, for example
i'm still slowly dollar cost averaging, but i'm going heavier into bitcoin if we drop into this price range just here, in between 28k and 22k
and if you've been keeping up to date with these videos over the past couple weeks, you'll know that i accumulated a bunch more bitcoin down at around 25k, because that was right in the middle of this buy zone that i've been talking about for a while now on the channel
this right here is the ethereum to yours dollar chart on the daily time frame
and obviously, we still have this active bullish divergence on the charts, which basically means the same thing as what i said about the bullish divergence on the bitcoin chart just earlier in the video
once again, i'm still mostly expecting sideways, choppy price action for ethereum as well in the shorter term
and so this could also be one of the reasons why we've seen the same symmetrical triangle pattern for ethereum on the six hour chart get invalidated
because initially the price of ethereum made an attempt of breaking out to the upside, and then we came back down for a retest and closed the candle, actually back below this upward turning line of support
and now we've seen a few six hour candle closes below this line of supports, which has essentially invalidated this pattern right here, because we have no clear breakouts
but if you're looking at the ethereum versus bitcoin chart on the three day time frame right now, this is actually not really good because what we have seen over the past one day is an attempt at breaking back above this previous, ascending line of support
and so far we now have one small rejection from this line of support, which is now acting as new resistance
and the current threeday kindle closes in around three hours from now
and if this candle closes in the red, that would basically confirm this rejection, which would technically be a bearish signal for aetherium versus bitcoin on the larger time frames
but as i've been mentioning in my recent ethereum update videos, i'm still keeping a close eye on this previous low, which is coming in at around 0064 bitcoin per ethereum
because obviously, until we break below that previous low, technically we're still in a higher low structure, which is technically a bullish structure
and breaking below that previous low would officially form a new lower low
so that would obviously put ethereum in an official downtrend on the threeday ethereum versus bitcoin chance
and in that potential bearish scenario, if we do break below that previous low, then my personal strategy would be to move some of my ethereum holdings into bitcoin for the time being, while ethereum potentially underperforms against bitcoin
but as of right now, at the time of recording this video, i have not made any significant decisions around ethereum versus bitcoin, at least just yet
and if you zoom into the daily time frame, technically this bullish divergence is still active on the charts, which is something that could save a theorem versus bitcoin, at least in the shorter term
and considering where the price is sitting at right now on the daily time frame and where the rsi is currently sitting out on the daily time frame, it's quite possible if we make a slight lower low with the next daily candle close, we could actually form a double bullish divergence simply another lower low while we form another higher low in the daily rsi for fdr, emphasis bitcoin
so this is also a signal that i am still paying attention to for the somewhat shorter term for ethereum vs bitcoin
and speaking about bullish divergences, taking a look at the nasdaq 100 index on the four hour time frame
and yes, we still have that bullish divergence that i talked about yesterday, which is one of the reasons why over the past one day we've held up relatively well in the stock markets, because this bullish divergence simply means we're due to see reduced bearish momentum, at least in the shorter term
but if you zoom all the way out to the weekly time frame for the nasdaq 100 index, looking at the weekly rsi, we are currently oversold
and this is actually an extremely rare signal for the stock markets, because the last time that the rsi on the weekly time frame for the nasdaq 100 index came anywhere near these values, that was basically at the bottom of the march 2020 crash, which was a very severe crash in the stock markets
and the time before that was at the end of the 2018 bear market for the stock market, which also marked the bottom for the 2018 bear markets for bitcoin as well at that same time period
but if you zoom even further out on the weekly time frame for the nasdaq 100 index, you can see that during the last significance recession, back in 2008, entering into 2009, we saw the weekly rsi plunge well into oversold territories
and right now we're not that low just yet, but keep in mind that was a very severe recession
but that's a story for another video, because there is a lot more that goes into that, like the fed, for example
dollar currency index, which is getting a strong rejection from this massive range of resistance, then definitely check out my last bitcoin update video that i posted yesterday on the channel
because the last two times where we saw a strong rejection in the usola currency index from this range of resistance, that's actually resulted in a bullish market reversal in both of these previous examples
and if you want to maximize your profits in crypto, whether or not prices are going up, down or sideways, check out these videos popping up right here on your screen, because both of these videos reveal how you can keep making money in crypto whether or not prices are going up, down or sideways
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so is this a crypto fake up, or is this a real crypto breaker? well let's have a look at the charts today
later on this week we'll probably know the true answer to this question
so first and foremost, i'm going to start off on the higher time frame chart, which is on the weekly
and i just want to point out over here that while we're currently getting stuck between these two moving averages, which are important ones, at least in my eyes, we have the 200 ema and the 21 ema over here, which are coming currently converging towards one another
so what you'll notice is that, if you have a look at price from a risk to reward point of view, you're probably wondering to yourself, well, where's the next major area of resistance and where's the next major area of support? well major resistance is going to be the gray box territory outlined above, and the major, major support is going to be coming down at the 21k area below
and where's price currently? you can see it's sort of stuck in the middle of that range
so, um, from a long term perspective and as a spot trader, so somebody that just buys the underlying assets, i would currently be waiting
rather, i would just be sitting on the sidelines, watching how the market reacts
and we may get that reaction a little bit later on in this week
so bitcoins currently trading at thirty thousand three hundred dollars
it's pretty much still sideways, as it has been for just over a week
now, moving on to this allimportant chart of the dexi, which is the dollar index
however, is this going to be a longterm reversal, or is it just going to be a higher low that setting on the longer term bull trend? well, we'll see later on
it's now coming down to 10156, where i would anticipate that, uh, there's a chance that it may bounce from there
now, if it bounces from there, that's going to be extremely bullish for the dollar, and most likely bearish towards the other risk on assets, going on to the stock market
you can see that price bounced straight into that key quarterly level
but very similar to bitcoin, i would anticipate that this is most likely just going to lead to another lower high
and we're going to have to wait for confirmation, so i'll get back to that on a future show
now, looking at this one on the more lower time frame charts, the first thing that you'll notice is that wick that we had to the downside, you can see that came it was met with high volume
now, one thing that i do like to see when it comes to any potential reversals or bounces, to evaluate whether it is going to be a real move or not, is i do want to see price holding above the 9 ema, which is this white line over here
but if you have a look over here, you'll see, okay, so we got price closed once above the nine ema, and we're working on our second candle over here on the daily
and then the other white line that i have here is governing the previous highs
so meaning i would start to switch bullish if we start to close above this 31 500 level, then i can start to target higher
that higher level is going to come at resistance, which has confluence on our previous weekly chart that i showed at 37 000
so if i move back to this chart, you'll notice same sort of area between 36 and 38 000 is going to be the main area of resistance
and that's going to be the top side of the bollinger band, which is currently coming back down
i did bring this up on friday, and i mentioned to you guys that really all that i see going on right now is bitcoin is stuck in a range
and that main range is sitting between 27 000 and the top of the box at 31 500
so get above the green box, start closing a couple of candles there, and you can start to target higher, towards the 34 000 zone
at the moment, you can see the momentum oscillators on the four hour are beginning to start to turn down
if bulls are able to take control today and push price above maybe the stock market starts to rally, and that will give them a chance to get above this box, then we can set in a higher high, and then we'll look to buy the higher low
now i just want to touch on that higher high and higher low thing and show you the importance of remaining patient and waiting
for those of you that were following me since i first started with these videos, you'll know that when we got to this area over here, we said, well, this could potentially so very similar to the environment that we're in now
price breached above the descending line, trend line that was governing price to the downside
i'm willing to switch bullish right now if price comes down and it sits in a higher low
we went straight into a lower low, and we remained out of the market
you'll notice that also, a lot of the altcoins have absolutely rallied enormously
some of them went as high as about 50 if you look at things like astroport
so phantom, there's speculation that andre crania is potentially coming back
if we have a look at this, you'll see that we have this trend line that's been governing price as well, sharply to the downside
and already price is starting to sell off even before hitting that line exact
so i would also, uh, remain out of phantom trades, or long phantom trades, for the time being
what i would want to see is if you could start to get price above this area over here, and especially above that 200 ema, then you can set in a beautiful higher high in that zone and look to buy the pullback
so, not much else to add from the previous show that we had on friday
and we'll see if wednesday's fomc meeting, as ted talks macro points out over here, if on wednesday that meeting goes well, then potentially we could break that range to the upside, and we can start to look for longs again

in this episode, we're taking a look at the bitcoin price on the four hourly, not managing to break this resistance at the 30 500
if we break it, where could we possibly get rejected? and if we reject this range and come down, which are the biggest support levels where we could get a big bounce
we also take a look at the weekly chart, and i'm going to show you what i do think could happen in the next coming weeks
there's a possible harmonic pattern that could make the s p 500 pump all the way up here, above 4 200 points
and i'm gonna show you also some different scenarios why this could happen on the s p 500

a quick reminder, if this video gets over 2 000 likes and you comment down below, you are eligible for a giveaway in bitcoin
so let's dive in here, straight into the four hourly chart with bitcoin, because we can see that we are struggling
we're not managing to break this 30 500 range, very important level right now
the bitcoin price does want to have that leg up where to to around about the 31 800 range, wide to that level, because it's been the value area high, as you can see from the volume traded the last 15 days, approximately
so i'm expecting this range to be very, very strong resistance
okay, round about that 318, 32 one hundred dollar range, where you could see, you know, plus minus a few hundred dollars, that volatility and a potential rejection
okay, i can show you with price action that did happen in the past, something very similar, that i was talking about in today's live stream, if you didn't join
what i want to show you, you know, we can see the close and open back in july, as you can see here on the chart
so if we zoom back in on the four hourly, it is also this major resistance level
it is the value area high from the volume traded the last 15 days
so there's a lot of confluence at this range where we could get heavily rejected
we could also take a look at fibonacci retracement from the last consolidation that we did have from the drop
okay? you can see a large consolidation after this big, major drop, sideways action, and then started dropping from this range
you could take fib levels from these highs, okay, from consolidations
fib levels can be taken from pullbacks or from consolidations before the actual big drop from this range down to this level over here
you know, that would be round about the 618 fibonacci retracement from this consolidation area
as you can see, there are big, major levels where you could take fibonacci
you know, a lot of confluence at that range where you could potentially get a big, big rejection on the price of bitcoin
now, what happens if we do not manage to break above this resistance level? of course, we might be rolling down
and we'll be attempting to hit this support level, the twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars, all right? is the biggest point of control from the volume traded below twenty eight thousand six hundred
okay, this price action over here, the biggest point of control is right over here
if we take the fixed range, like i explained in other videos, you know, this range, biggest point of control is that twenty thousand six hundred dollars
expect much lower levels, such as twenty seven eight thousand dollars, approximately around that range
okay? i take daily levels, four hourly levels, weekly levels and monthly levels are the most important
the lower the time frame you go then the weaker the level gets
but four hourly is also good, strong level, and it is here round about the 27 600
and it's also the 618 from the fib level of the lows to the extreme highs here
so if you do break this 28 600, i am personally expecting a potential big bounce from this level
okay, so something, you know, i've got the bearish case scenario if we do pump from this level
guys, something that i am waiting for for the next coming days to make some trade, because i'm hardly doing any trades here
this is just, in a nutshell, what i'm expecting here for the price of btc
and, you know the deal, just a quick reminder for any quick subscribe, any new subscribers, this 30 000 range, huge support level
now, this doesn't mean that we cannot feel the wick and then push up, okay? this is very possible
we could actually fill the wick and then continue to the upside
but i am looking for that relief rally, potentially to hit the resistance from these lower highs, and also to back test the support from this ascending channel
okay, we need to go to the crime, the scene of the crime, okay, which would be the support of this ascending channel
and what i wanted to show you here on the daily is that we have reached the level
okay? we have reached the target from this ascending channel, the width of the channel from the breakout, meeting that target here to perfection, just above 25 000
okay, looking at the daily, there's big consolidation, a bit of volatility and coming back up here to retest the support of the channel, with this ascending channel as resistance
and we've also got, if this happens in the next five to six days, which is very, very possible, also retesting the lower highs
but i think there's a high probability in that we are going to get that relief rally

let's go straight into the s p 500, because the s p 500 looks pretty bullish, in my opinion, here, for this week, maybe between this week and next week
why do i think that it's bullish? well, we can see here that we are getting bounces from these lower lows
all right, first of all, i want to zoom out here on the three daily chart, and i want to show you how this has been a kind of an abc correction on the s p 500 from the old time high in december of 2021
you can see the correction coming as low here as the 4 100 points approximately, then this bounce up, creating that lower high, and then breaking here the lows, as you can see
why? one to one? because if we take a look at the fibonacci based extension from the high to the lows to the highest ride over here, it has been approximately that one to one extension to that 3 80 points approximately where we are getting supported
where to well, looking at the three daily chart, the biggest level here, three day level, is these lows over here
why do i think we can come up there? because i can also see a potential shark pattern, harmonic pattern
let me just show you here, this harmonic drag it all the way up here
all right, where you could see this sharp pattern playing out here
very important for the sharp pattern, all right, that you need to hit at least the point 88, all right, from x to d, point 88 region, or even higher
and this is also a big, major resistance where you potentially could get that big correction from this level
this has not been a successful breakout, so i think there's a high probability a little bit of volatility and having that push up
first major attempt would be this resistance at the four thousand sixty dollars
four thousand sixty point, sorry, four thousand seventy points, approximately
we could reach those levels in the next coming days, in my personal opinion, and then potentially break up
and then this is a very, very strong level, the four 4 280 points, approximately, where we could get a heavy, heavy rejection and continue back down
all right? this shark pattern is bearish, uh? and yeah, i think we could see a big, major relief rally
we'll be also hitting this major resistance, okay, resistance right over here, resistance, resistance
and it is also lower, high resistance, adding in this kind of big, uh, descending wedge kind of formation
are we gonna absolutely crash and roll down with the s p uh, in the next coming days? or are we gonna manage to have that big relief rally? something that i wanted to point out also here, zooming out from the threeday chart, if we take a look at covid, all right, of the c19 crash, uh, the ultimate low level, okay, of march of 2020, at the 2184 points, approximately fibonacci retracement from lower to this high, we are actually hitting the 382, as you can see, to perfection
all right, another great fib level, which would be the potential d point of that sharp pattern
and we can see that that is very, very possible, that relief rally all the way up to the 4 200 4 300 points in the next coming days, week or two, is very possible on the s p 500
let me know what do you think? do you think s p 500 is going to drop from these levels? or first we're going to see a relief rally, potentially to create a lower high, and then potentially continue back down? let me know guys
check out bitcoin center's website for the latest news, technical analysis ideas
so what is up my crypto legends? how is everyone doing? hope you have a fantastic monday, start of the week with your trading
we're going to analyze the situation here for bitcoin, see what's going on, guys
i do think that we are going to see that bounce at some point
i actually do prefer if the price does drop from these levels, we can see this major descending triangle kind of situation here that we were talking about on yesterday's video
and they are going to be major trading opportunities on bitcoin
we've got a major weekly level here, the 31 770, approximately, where we do see this big resistance zone
very likely going to get that potential rejection from this range, okay, and maybe continue down
but we do have some big, major levels where we can get into some big opportunity trades
it's the value area high, from the volume traded the last, you know, up to 15 days
and i'm looking for that rejection at that 32 000 in the immediate, short term
this doesn't mean that we can do this and then maybe do this, but they are just shortterm opportunities right there
this is currently where we are getting that rejec uh, rejection right now
we could concentrate here just a few more weeks and then roll back down, because we're not going to manage to get above this big, major zone
you know, it looks exciting, and there is a high probability right now that we might just consolidate and break above this level
but as you can see, this is the last lower high zone from the volume traded the last 15 days
okay, as you can see here on the chart, major wicks, major wicks
and there's going to be a lot of opportunities from here, from here
remember, you do have a huge bonus down below for bible and for primax bt
now, let's take a look here at the comment section, because i also want to talk about, talk about dax 30, okay, the german stock market
all right? this was, you know, on the uh in march, approximately
and what i want to show you is how we bounced from the biggest point of control, okay? this is how how powerful this volume profile is, right? we've been going, we've been in a big, massive uptrend now for over 10 years
this is looking at the threeday chart, and the price of the dax 30, okay? came all the way down here to this level over here, around about the 12 300 points, getting that exact balance from this level, from the highest point of control, from the volume traded for almost the last 10 years, last 10 years, biggest value area
okay? the biggest point of control is right over here at the 12 300 points
okay? as you can see, this is the value area high from the volume traded from the last almost 10 years, okay, from 2012
we're right over here, just getting that consolidation, getting that bounce
so does this mean that this has just been a huge, massive correction
i know a lot of people are expecting a big, massive crash, recession on the stock markets, but who knows what
if we are going to get a recovery, we have huge amount of volume profile here on dax 30 that we need to break down below
and for the moment, this is looking pretty good for a potential double bottom with a second higher bottom here
looking at dax 30, we do have this big, big, major resistance on dax 30, which is around about the for the 15 000 points
so we're going to go through the cop i'm going to go through the comment section
and we can focus, you know, two, three minutes on a chart, or even five minutes, to see if we can see any good opportunities
how are you? breakout or not? says christian, uh, no, i would say no, i would say no
not a successful breakout, in my opinion, and i wouldn't be looking for me personally
you know, this could be a big, massive wick and come straight back down
i i do not trust the breakout trading, okay, on bitcoin and crypto
if i if we do break and start pumping like crazy, i know that very, very likely, with a high percentage probability, that we are going to get rejected, maybe just slightly below the 32 000
i'm looking for that, you know, swing failure kind of pattern from this breakout over here, and then maybe have an attempt or even continue back down
but like i said, you know, this is the one of the most important levels
look at these wicks reaching all the way up here, the thirty thousand seven hundred dollars
you know, this is on the 17th of may, the 18th of may, the 20th of may
we need to get above this zone for it to be major support level
you know, that is the level you want to get into once you successfully break out of it
so, um, yeah, for the moment, this is not a successful breakout
i know it does look like that we're breaking out from these lower highs, but, yeah, it's still, we need to get it above the last lower high, the last lower high, which is this one
we need to get above that level for a potential leg up to the value area high
because it's very likely we'll get above this one, very likely we'll be hitting, you know, that thirty one thousand seven hundred, thirty one thousand eight hundred, as soon as we get above this major range um there's thirty thousand five hundred, thirty thousand six hundred
i am looking for these major zones, you know, potential short, potential long
all our crypto legends, mark dutch here in the community inside of the comment section
jazim, how are you? natalie? how are you? natalie in the comment section
hey, hey, hey, how are you doing? should i take a long on seoul? let's take a look at solana
let's not ask, you know, should i long or should i short? because, yeah, i mean, not financial advice, of course
i don't want to say what if you're going to long or short, if you should or not, i will tell you what i would probably do, then you can do whatever you want
of course, you can take my analysis and do your own analysis with my one
and solana has been dropping aggressively for the last few months, as we know
we've been talking about this, okay, for the last couple of weeks where this level okay, where we do have a big spike on the vpvr
it was a major consolidation range back in may of 2021, june and july, as you can see here, where we do have that spike on the vpvr
not a huge bounce just yet, but in my personal opinion, i think this is going to get a big bounce, potentially to even 80 dollars
and, you know, maybe a lot of people are so bearish right now that they say, i don't see solana hitting eighty dollars
no, we're gonna see, very likely, see some relief rallies before we continue back down
you're having a stop here, you're having a breather, to probably get a big impulse to actually come down and break it
well, if i take a look at the volume profile, there is a huge gap here in between this forty dollar range and eighty dollars
and as you know, you know the reason why i think we could, you know, come back up there very fast, the volume that we have had, the price action that we traded back in august of 2021
and we actually said also in other live streams, if solana were to break the last few weeks, this eighty dollars, we will drop very fast down to around about a forty dollar area, okay, where we do have the big spike on the vpvr, because there's no volume traded
what happened? we fell, you know, straight through this level because it was a very fast move up
we come back fast down from 80 to 40, as you can see here on the chart
now, biggest, one of the biggest point of control is is from this range, okay? from the volume traded back in 2021, as you can see
so that relief rally back up to the 80 it's very, very likely
so in my personal opinion, a swing long position, i will definitely consider a swing long position on solana, potentially to round about that 80 range
it is very, very, very possible that we have that price action if bitcoin does behave, of course, if i do see bitcoin hitting that 36 38 000 that we were talking about yesterday, it was all explained on yesterday's video, why we we could be hitting that 36 38 000 range after this big, major drop, okay? relief rally hitting the resistance of this lower high range
if this does happen to bitcoin, 36 to 38 000, easily we can see solana hitting that 80 mark, okay, in the next coming weeks, where we have one of the biggest, biggest resistance, also here, big vp vr levels, as you can see
that might be an incredible shorting opportunity if we do get up there
i am definitely going to consider, i'm going to wait for bitcoin, because bitcoin may be, maybe, is not going to be able to break above this level
and i would potentially prefer to long a break down from the support level, looking for that higher low
i've explained this on the other videos, how, you know, we are looking for that double bottom
we're looking for that double bottom right over here with a slightly higher low
and you know, this is the, these are levels where institutions, big money, is not interested in selling, okay? but it is, you know, it is interested in catching, you know, retail traders, where you might get that pump, you might get that fake out come down
will we get that opportunity? i don't know, but i, you know, if we do come down, there is that double bottom scenario
that double bottom range is what i am looking for here, which is very, very likely to happen
and you know, one of the main reasons why is because of this huge, huge, major level
guys not going to successfully break down 25 000 in this week or next week
we are going to see a relief rally, very likely, before we actually have a big move to the downside
and that's just how, you know that the market moves, especially getting that reaction
so the probabilities in the next coming couple of weeks, is having that relief rally
if this doesn't happen, okay, where i'm looking for longs down here, then, of course, i will be looking for a quick, short day trade, or small swing trade at this, you know, 32 000 range, slightly below 32 000, big, major level where we're very likely going to get a small rejection
all right? and yeah, that that's the level where i am looking for trades, this major weekly level, big resistance right there
what, you know, you can see this range also, it's been resistance
okay? you can see a kind of a small double bottom right there
from the breakout, getting a wick below above this weekly a lot of wicks here, that major wick, and then a straight back down
it's just very likely to see something like that, where there's not going to be a successful breakout from this rain job
i'm looking to short here and looking to take profits exactly at that resistance
you know, that is, that is my trading plan for, you know, today tomorrow
because is this going to be a fake out? is this going to be a successful breakout? i don't know
i know that this range, this 32 000 area, is huge resistance, and it's not going to be an easy breakout, straight line for bitcoin
we are going to see some major pullbacks where you can see, when you where you can get make some money on on those moves
and of course, this over here, if we do have a really huge breakout with volume at this moment from this range, it's going to be looking pretty good
if i see a four hourly, one hourly candlestick here, volume candlestick like this, just like we did see back in, you know, the 11th of may and 12th of may, we break out like this with a huge green candle, with huge volume
then if we do retrace down to the biggest point of control, which is here at the 30 200, 30 100, we've got resistance here, resistance, resistance
you know, that would be the most that would be the ideal trade
so i am looking for that scenario in the next coming hours, you know, in the next couple of days
you need to wait for potential volatility wix and and, you know, be patient, not risk too much
but huge opportunities coming, you know, between today and tomorrow at these levels
you know, this is going to very likely be a a quick range trade
and yeah, i will be talking about this on the live streams, of course, talking about this on the daily updates
let's wait to see if we do get those rejection from those levels
of course, if we do have a turning over point right here, where we do have a failed breakout and come straight back down, which is also very, very possible
and then i am looking for that higher low over here on the price of bitcoin
okay, um, very likely to hit, you know, the 618 fibonacci retracement here at the 276, 274 range
and i will be looking for a potential harmonic if we do create that higher low
until we create that high low, i will not be talking about, you know, predictions of something that hasn't happened
well, i mean, this is the thing, i have, you know, three opportunities here
you know, we either, you know, it either turns around, and we do have that, you know
why are you too late? you know, you, it's not too late, you know, you oh, so we're going straight up from here then, yeah, it's not too late
this is just an opportunity right over here that could happen
there's also one over here, if we do start pumping to that range
[Music], yeah, i think ethereum is gonna get very, very big resistance at this 2 200 level
okay? we almost touched it here on the 15th of may, but we do have several bounces, as you can see here on the price action
okay, right over here, we did get about our support on january
also one over here in may, before we broke down, got resisted slightly below this range
now, if we start breaking this level, of course, and hit two thousand five hundred dollar ethereum, of course, this is only if bitcoin does manage to go up to thirty six, thirty eight thousand dollars, we will be seeing ethereum, of course, trading at 2500
we do know that that 2500 is huge, huge resistance, as you can see here on the chart
and there is going to be a lot of trading opportunities as soon as we get above that level, a lot of big support and resistance ranges
if it does roll down from this range, you know, i'm looking for that kind of batman inverse batman pattern
and there's going to be a big opportunity only if bitcoin does drop
so there is a high possibility that we are going to break out from the zone
and like i said, this 32 000 range, exactly, to to be more exact, 31 800
it's going to be a interesting to see how we react at that level, because a pullback will be very, very likely to happen
okay, i would say 80, 80, 85 percent of the times we do fill the gaps
let's go through the threeday chart and take a look at this crypto
this is what happened to a lot of the cryptos from 2018 to 2020
okay, where where you probably this one's just going to raise, you know, go flat for a long, long time
okay? this is a typical chart that is just going to be absolutely boring for a long, long time
if we need to break above this range, this is a a level where it's going to be critical
this is not going to be a, you know, this is not a successful breakout from these lower highs, we start breaking above this range
uh, i will be looking for shorts at this level, not for, not for longs
of course, if we do have a successful breakout with high volume, not reach this level and then come down to this range, it's going to be a good long opportunity, in my opinion, also, but i want to see that breakout
where's the biggest point of control? it's currently underneath us
from the volume traded the last 15 days, biggest point of control is exactly at the 30 150
so if we do have big volume breakout, huge volume on this move, retracement, and we do retrace to this range, this resistance area, thirty thousand two hundred, thirty thousand one hundred range, biggest point of control
it could be 50, it could be 61618, from the lows to the highs
we're looking for that retracement, fifty percent, six, one, eight
you know, if that does happen, that is where where i am looking for that um day trade, long position
let's take a look at the yeah, we have the value area high from the volume traded in between the 13th of may to the 23rd
so when we're looking at the 10day range trading, of course, this is range trading, we've got a zone right over here
and you can just see here, why are we, why are we trading in inside of this range? also, because you know, from this half point, you already have the value area low, the value area high
we need a breakable of the value area high, okay, which is round about the 30 500, these highs, the last highs we've created the last few days, if we break above successfully, and i'm looking for an explosive breakout, because what could happen is something like this, where you did break out this last high, look at this
what happens you you break out from this high? you might think, oh, this is going to turn into support
i want to see it move big time, 1500, even 2 000 to the upside, a big, big move from this range
and then we're talking, you know, then we're talking trading, then we're looking, you know, then i'm looking for shorts, then i'm looking for longs at these ranges
as soon as we get above this high, i've got an alarm set to see the the reaction
and, you know, i'll potentially be looking for shorts at that level
you know, bitcoin does have all the cards to break out from this zone right now, because it's there, it's there, it's there, it's there
so that is the that is the opportunities that i am looking for here, guys, breaking above, just just to be pretty clear for anybody new that is coming right now
any new subscribers, breaking above the thirty thousand five hundred dollar range successfully
because you might think, there's a lot of people saying, you said thirty thousand five hundred with trading at thirty thousand five hundred and eighty right now
look at the volatility we could have with this pop here, hitting 31, sorry, 30 800 or so and coming straight back down
i want to see a big breakout, big breakout with big volume, this 31 770 range, huge weekly level
we can see the resistance zone, the volatility at this range, at this 32 000 area, where i think we could potentially get a big rejection
a lot of people will be looking, you know, for those big, major pumps
i'm just saying that there's a, you know, there's an opportunity right there for that retracement
and at this level, the biggest point of control, there's an opportunity at the value high, there is an opportunity at this level
also, if we do retrace after a big breakup with volume and low volume on the retracement, there is a big opportunity right there
so we're also looking at 50 level fibonacci from the lows, you know, depending on where we pump to, but it will be very likely around about the 50 fibonacci, okay, approximately this range
um, anyway, let's see if that happens in the next coming days
or the scenario would be not successfully breaking out and coming down
and phantom says russell, absolutely will be taking a look at, uh, phantom
what's going on with phantom? i mean, wow, phantom got absolutely crushed here
you know, major levels from back, i mean, this was some boxes checked out from, yeah, from 2021
we can get this out of the way and mark the most important levels, uh? okay
[Music], yeah, i mean, we don't, i think we could not come much, much lower on phantom
i think, you know, the 20 cent level is already a very, very cheap price
and we hit 22 cents, a big, big, big level here, summer lows of 2021
we came all the way down to the summers summer lows of 2021, which is pretty crazy
but what i want to show you, and we'll be zooming in, how a relief rally almost to the one dollar range, okay, a phantom can gain 100 of its value next coming weeks, just because of the, um, huge, aggressive drop that we've had
i think we are, we are actually gonna, yeah, we're breaking out from a major zone
we got lower highs here, lower high trend line, a consolidation, you know, the last 24 hours, exactly on this trend line
this major zone, after this big pump, is very likely going to be big support
and second, let me just check these levels, major zones here on phantom
we could get rejected from that range if we come back down to this consolidation level, i'm talking about the 42 cent range
very likely that you're going to see some bouncers at that range
you're going to see a, you know, potential rejection at 54 cents, big level over there
a potential balance at 42 cents, if we do come back down there in the next couple of days
i think, bigger relief rally the coming weeks, if bitcoin does behave and go to 36 38 000 in the next coming weeks, phantom being one of the most famous l1 projects, okay, i think it will have that relief rally, potentially to one dollar
i mean, this is the thing, this is why we talked about this yesterday
if the dxy does break the last big higher low, which is this one right over here, this big, major resistance level turning into support
let me just zoom out on the daily here, the three day chart actually, and zoom out
remember the dxy breaking to perfection and getting a bounce to perfection from the lower highs of 2017 and 2020
resistance zone turning into support and now not managing to have steam to continue back up
this is the trend line where we got the the bounce to perfection
okay, we'll have, just in case someone says, you know, trend lines are not, you know, they do not, um, they're worthless
uh, no, you get that bounce to perfection on the dxy, from that big, major resistance, lower high turning into support
and what has happened right over here is that, on the four hourly, you can already see that you are forming these bearish diversions on the rsi, on the dxy
let me just show you that you are forming, like i said yesterday, the lower highs on the rsi
okay? now you're saying, yes, the you know that we are seeing the bearish divergence play out
so, um, you can actually spot this, that you are going to potentially going to get that rejection, that re you know, that nice correction here on the on the dxy, as soon as you have this consolidation
so dxy is is having this correction? is it going to continue back down? well, this is the thing, we are at a critical range
there's this last higher low, which is at the 102, uh, 10250, right over here
we need to solid breakdown, then this is going to give bitcoin that big relief rally
for the moment, dxy, if we do hold this support level, you could say, okay, we're breaking down
but this is not a successful breakout, in my opinion, just yet
we can have volatility above this last higher low and this trend line, and this is just gonna have a big, big bounce
it would be ideal to see that lower high on dx y here, and then continue back down
so if this does happen, if we do see that relief rally, uh, on on the dxy, after this major drop for the last, you know, five to six days, um, we're gonna see bitcoin get hit
and this is why you could potentially see that double bottom, okay, that double bottom on on bitcoin, if you do create that lower high here on the dxy
there's a little bit of speculation right there, but i do think it's very, very possible
just by looking at bitcoin, how bitcoin is at floor levels at this, you know, in the in the immediate short term
you know the deal, this big, big weekly volume that we were create, that we did create last week, sorry, actually, two weeks from now
we can see in the past, okay, how the weekly volume has managed to, you know, call a top or a bottom
this is why i think that we're not going to break down successfully from the 25 000 just yet for the next coming weeks
but first of all, our potential relief rally is very, very likely
like i mentioned, you can see the big spikes on volume on the weekly showing you a bottom, a local bottom, massive, big pump
we've got may of 2021 bottom, massive, big pump, as you can see back in august
you can just not ignore it, all right? because you have so many times, so many times in the past where you have had, you know, this showing you a local top or local bottom
so many times we've had the spike on volume, we haven't had a volume like this on the weekly since one year ago
you know, we might not break down below 25 000 just because what's happened in the past
most of the times, 80 to 90 of the times, that is a big, high probability thing
are you bullish? will the dxy break down? will dxy enter a downtrend the next coming months? let me know
okay? will the dollar, will the dollar index lose value in the coming months? will it lose value? will it be a downtrend? will it lose value? guys? let me know in the poll
will the dollar index lose value in the coming months? guys? let me know right away
do you think the dollar index, you know, the dollar value is going to absolutely explode in the next coming months? all right
is it going to be, at the end of the year, the most extreme, strongest currency that there is? it is actually today
but anyway, is it going to be stronger? will the dxy be stronger? and you have to take a look at apecoin
will it lose value, or will it continue up? okay, this is the thing, this is the thing i have, i have, if we do break this trend line successfully, you know, there is always the scenario that happens on most of the assets, you know, also, that you break a trend line, and then what happens is you come back up, and you retest it as resistance, and then you you have the roll over
okay? we've got this low over here getting rejected heavily as resistance
you know, the thing is, once you haven't retested this low area since march of 2022, what happens? you know, you didn't retest it here, you didn't retest it here, not here, not here
you got a huge, massive wick here on the on the ftx exchange, a little bit fishy move there
very, very cautious on this because, i mean, let's take a look at another yeah, that wick is not on the coinbase chart
but you can see here, right where when you retested this range, right there, you get it
so if we do break this level where we are going to very likely get resistance is this 11 range
so if we do break that 950, big resistance zone, it's gonna very likely be, uh, be resistance
i would be shorting this range, that 10, 10, 80, 10, 11 range on a coin
you are kind of forming big, aggressive lower hide right there
if it does have an explosive breakout to the 950, i would actually look for shorts
okay, big, big level on apecoin, the 950, um for a quick scalp
you know, we can see bitcoin, there's something that happened on bitcoin that i think could happen on on bitcoin and a lot of other cryptos
let me just quick, quickly show you, um, it's right over here
where do we have that price action? where do we have that price action? right over here
and, you know, pay attention to this, because it's very, very similar price action
let me just take a look, you know, apecoin, you know, we can take a look at a coin if you wish, or we can take a look at bitcoin, really out there at these price levels
this consolidation right here at the 32 000 range, when you see this big, massive drop in bitcoin, you know, the big consolidation area is this one where you, you know, we, we have a huge amount of liquidity above this range
and if you take a look at bitcoin at on december of 2021, december 2021, you have this last lower high from the dead cat bounce, right there
you have a big, massive drop, dead cat bounce, consolidation right there
you kind of break out from these lower highs, as you can see, right? you got the lower highs, lower highs, lower highs
i mean, this is just looking at the chart, looking at price action where you could balance major bouncing levels
i'm going to explain why right now on on on this chart, you know, let me just, let me just get the bitcoin price on on private here, where i do have my levels marked
you know, the reason why, this is the reason why i am looking for shorts at this 32 000 range from this consolidation
and this is the reason why, if we do come up here and we do retrace, i am looking for a quick long trade at this range
and it might just be for a double top, or or hitting the 618 from this level
and it's basically because of, you know, price action in the past
you gain the highs here for a liquidity grab of the last lower highs
and, you know, i'm just going to switch back here quickly to this price action back from december of 2021
swing, failure pattern, roll back down, double top right there
no, right here, last lower high after the big, major um drop, you got lower high, resistance, resistance, resistance
so the similarities that i am looking for is very, you know, it's almost the same kind of movement i'm looking for, gaining this high, getting rejected, coming down, getting that bounce from this big resistance level where there will be one bounce, potentially with i would say, 75 percent of possibility of getting a bounce from that level, from this 30 500 range, getting up this level here, losing it, coming back down, getting a bounce from this resistance, and then maybe creating a double top
but yeah, a double top with maybe a slightly lower high or a double top range
so we are the very last, basically we are here right now on bitcoin, right where we want to get above the last lower high range
last lower high from the the the dead, you know, the major drop, swing failure
get here to the last lower high, get rejected, bounce as support, double top
break above gain the highs, get rejected, come down, get a bounce from this resistance as support, maybe double top weekly level, continue back down
anyway, just by looking at the volume profile, looking at volume profile here, like i said, you know, it is the value area high from the volume traded, all right? for the last, um, over 15 days
this is where, you, you the volume disappears suddenly, of course
i don't, i don't care if bitcoin drops or pumps from this level
i will be ready to take these major opportunities once the price action comes to me
let's take a look at, hi andy, can you take a look at phantom? i have just taken a look at phantom about five minutes ago
this might have, you know, this is probably very likely at the very end of a big, massive downtrend, and and just consolidating
if we zoom out on the daily, you know, huge, huge, massive drop on dent coin, losing the summer lows of 2021
i'm not, i'm not sure if we do have more data here on the binance, no, tether
yeah, let me just check out the other three daily chart, zoom out a little bit
i think this was just gonna enter a big, large, large consolidation at these levels
but i do think that the um the summer lows, can be big resistance in the short term, until we find a kind of a double bottom or sideways action
if we go to the full hourly chart on dent coin, some of those is right over here, at the point zero, zero, sixteen cents, approximately
but yeah, looking at that point zero, zero, 15 cents, right over here
i mean, taking a look at these altcoins right now, is is a little bit worthless
but this is just going to enter a huge, large accumulation consolidation level
i'm not sure if it will be a an accumulation zone, but it's just going to be boring price action for many months

what is your opinion on iota, please? i think iota is a very strong project
it has very similar technology, like phantom um, like, uh, also dag, which is um um
uh, dag is, yeah, what was um? constellation? daggers, constellation, yeah, very similar
and also, can you take a look at caster? yeah, i'm not sure we do have caster data here on, we do have some here
caster, of course, is in a big, massive downtrend, just like everything
and, um, it's having a little bit of a relief rally now, of course, after these major, severe drops
um, caster, in my personal opinion, once they have the app launched, uh, it will explode
you know, all these big influences, you know, um, in me, including myself, of course, i will be talking about caster when it launches
and so many people are going to talk about caster that the token is very likely going to get a rally
and then once that happens, you know, very likely it's just going to pump
let me just take a look, you know, we are potentially going to get, um, maybe rejected from this big level over here
the 20 cent level has been a big level where we did get, you know, a bounce here, support support
so we're very likely going to get rejected from this range, maybe a head and shoulder scenario or something like this
i don't think caster will fall much, much lower, in my opinion
what they want to do is is, you know, very, very big in the crypto space
absolutely right away, russell, uh, let's take a look, um, at how do i become a tom bitcoin sensors
let's take a look at roon here for russell, what's going on? and i'm just doing a quick, quick overview, of course, of the things, um, guys
i will be doing a poll today, because i will be doing an update video
and i will ask in the telegram group what crypto should i add with bitcoin analysis? and i will do a poll, okay? and i will ask five different cryptos, such as ethereum, cardano, maybe runes
you know, i would choose some mid caps, low caps and high caps
so if you don't haven't joined the telegram group, it is down below, also in the description the telegram group is here
join the telegram as i will be asking the community what crypto shall be doing a full analysis with bitcoin in today's video
let's take a look at roon, because roon is at floor levels, basically
it's absolutely insane how roon is hitting a big, big, major zone
um, this reminds me very much of of bitcoin, right? where we do have the summer lows
we do have the lows from february, january here, february, actually, we also have the lows again here
we haven't broken successfully this this level on roon, massive, big, lower highs
so a relief rally on roon, you know, if we do see bitcoin ethereum, having that relief rally
bitcoin 236 38 000 is going to be absolutely huge for some of these cryptos
roon is one of those thor chain, um, you know, is is one of those l1 projects that i think is going to succeed
you know, they are, they are masters, supposedly, they are masters, in changing cryptos from chain to chain, and, um, interoperability
so i think this one the, this is one of the coins that is going to do extremely well in the next ball run
question is, will it manage to break it, or will it come back down and create another bottom, or then another fail bottom and continue down? but it is very, very likely in the next coming days, to hit that 380
i do think that is going to happen on roon, come up to that 37380 range in the next coming days
yeah, roon can be traded on by but remember, you do have a great bonus down below
and i will be asking in the telegram group, what are the cryptos shall we take a look at with bitcoin? of course, bitcoin is going to be the number one
i might take a look at one or two cryptos with bitcoin in today's update
let's take a look here, because i think i do have a super chat
um, mark dutch, do i have a super super chat? i can see some hammers and spanners and, um, yeah, i don't think so
where's the super chat? i can't see a super chat by the looks of things
i haven't got a super chat, but if i do, then i will show you my the analysis in the telegram group
make sure to smash up the like button join the telegram group
i will be asking the community, what are the crypto should i do a full analysis to check out the major resistance support levels, where we could get, you know, fibonacci range, to to see if we can find some opportunities on that old coin
i will be asking the community today for the next video and the next coming hours, follow all our socials down below

so we have an overview look of what's happening, uh, during the day on the charts
so a couple of days a week i will have some back testing with you guys during the night, just to show you what i see on the chart, so you can learn from me
don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
if you were on my live stream yesterday, you know that i am in buy, in one buy position at the moment on a bitcoin
i was supposed to jump into the um in the trade at 29 720, but i missed that trade
so i bought the market when i saw we had that, when we broke in, when we, when i saw that we did break the resistance trend line
but we're gonna start off with looking at dxi, the dollar index
and this is something that we spoke about a couple of days ago
i do expect us to, uh, first of all, to drop back down to 101400, and potentially 100 630
what i also did was that i took a, what did i do? okay, we took a fibonacci from here
but what we could have done is that we could have taken a fibonacci from from this high to this previous higher low
and that also gave us the confirmation that this level is very respected
and we also spoke about this, uh, this is on this uh yesterday and also on the video that i did have, uh, alert, potential scenarios for bitcoin
on the daily chart, two daily chart, we had this inverted hammer against a support, which means that this is a zone where we could expect the market to pull back up to create a lower high
so, but to what level can can we pull back down to? uh, if we combine the dxi combined with bitcoin, now, um, it looks like we can have a bigger drop back down to 100
so that that technically means that we can have a bigger pullback on bitcoin too, and that we can come back up to 34 200, potentially 35 and 500
i do have my take profit at 31 600, so we just might see the market giving us a wick
and then this is where i slowly, instead it will look for the market to go back down, i will move my stop loss into entry
so i'm in a safe position right now on the buy order that i do have
um, so yeah, i just wait for the market to to pull back up a little bit more
but if we only have a short pullback, what we also can do is that we drag the fibonacci from 34 040 back down to the support
and that gives us fibonacci levels at 31 400 and thirty two thousand
so if you only see that the market comes to these levels, and then we're slowly starting to see the market reverse
we just might only come to these fibonacci levels, and then, uh have the break, i'll have the drop
so we're just gonna, i'm just gonna follow and see what level we will uh, retest
what i did yesterday was that i took a fibonacci from twenty nine thousand two hundred and thirty four to thirty thirty thousand one hundred and twenty six
so this was actually where i was supposed to buy the market, but i, i never did that
so that's why i jumped into when we saw the break and retest of the resistance trend line
because if we also zoom in on the one hourly chart, we do have, um, this, uh, so this candlestick right here, i don't want to call it a the inverted hammer, but when i see the market giving us these, uh wicks to the upside, that means that we need to fill the weights
so i was pretty confident that the market was supposed to push, push back up
we could also have taking another fib from the last higher low to the higher high
the market came back down, gave you another entry, even though i'm no financial advisor, but it gave you another entry
so i i would not be surprised that would you have some bullish momentum right now
but just just have in mind that everything that we see on the charts right here, this is only a lower low, right? and after a lower low, we need to come back up and to create a lower high for then break down to create another lower low, right? so this is what we look for, at least what i look for
so are the two daily the same thing here, we did have the inverted hammer against the support, also against the 50, uh, that we have on the three monthly charge
and the same thing that we saw on bitcoin is that if we see a bigger momentum, we just move our, uh, fibonacci back up to the res to the previous lower high at 2940
so we just might see the market pull back up to these levels, and then maybe see the reverse back down
but until we reach these levels, we can still use this previous lower high to see if we pull back up to potentially 2160 and 223
so as i told you, i still believe that we will have, i still believe that we will continue back up
but we need to follow and see if the market will eventually um
so this support trendline is the one that in this case, we'll see if we will hold it and see the continuation
right? we just might break it a little bit, but that doesn't mean that we will reverse and just see the drop, because we need to see if that could potentially only be another higher low on the lower time frames being created
so that is why we use different trend lines to see when the break of structure happens, or even if it happens
so when we use nas, fibonacci level on the lower time frames, what i do is that i also look for a demand zone
so from this candlestick right here, in this candlestick, we saw this push to the upside
we also saw the market came back down the wreath as that level
and when i highlight the close of the body, back down to the wrist, to the to the cl to the wick, the we are exactly combined with the 15 61 percent that would you have
i think that we can come back up to, uh, twelve thousand seven hundred potentially, uh, twelve thousand eight hundred and ninety five, and then see a potential drop
so, uh, we do we look at a previous support we saw a fake out from this level, what can happen is that we just might see a pullback, because the market is right now creating a a higher high
so if we drag a another fibonacci from low to high, that is also connected with the support that i just drew
so if we see a pullback, we can have it pull back down to 11 845, or potentially 11 11763, and then see the push back up
eight thousand three hundred and twenty two uh pips to the third, to the third take profit
i think that on every pair kind of um, when it comes to used against usd we will have a push, push to the upside, because dollars is going down, and we created a lower low, so we will see the market create a lower high
so so same thing i use 30 is that i just need to wait for the market to pull back down
so either we can come back down to potentially thirty one thousand three hundred and eighty, if we see bigger drop, we can come back down to thirty thirty one thousand one hundred and fifty, and then see the pull back to the upside
but overall, i do believe that we can have a pullback up to 31 974, potentially 32 145
and from these levels, combined with the resistance trend line, we could definitely see a a push down
i'm already in a buy position right now on bitcoin, on by bit, so i i bought the market yesterday
don't forget that you can also receive that bonus on buy bits up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
this platform is super great when we want to hold our position for a long time with the zero and low, very low fees, which is really good

because every time me and andy go on our youtube or have our daily updates, uh, the telegram alerts gives you, um, the notification through our community
otherwise, i'm always live this time, every single day, uh, from, uh, from 8am swedish time, so one hour before london session
well, okay, so yeah, nine hours ago i was, i did have this study, and back to sta live
i think you need to, i need, i think you need to look up that yourself
i don't know what can be the problem, but, yeah, so right now we're looking at the market to pull back up, as i told you in the beginning of the live stream
um, tomorrow we do have the fed chair, powell speaking again at 6 20 pm
so this box tells us that we can have a little bit of volatility, uh, on a usd
so, but you know that i'm live every morning at least eight am to nine, around 2 9 am
uh, is there any other coins that you want me to look at while we are, while we're here? oh, we can go to xbase
i also have a little, small community with the people that want to have direct contact with me
i just need to send it through my phone, because otherwise it does not work
so if you want to be part of my lovely community, also, bitcoin census community, natalie, you are more than welcome on this live on this chat, we always talk about, uh, we talk about trading, and we show each other respect
so if you can fill those criterias, you are more than welcome to be part of the of my group
so if you want to, uh, learn more about trading overall, because i'm very good when it comes to the technical you're more than welcome to be there
we have so many people that's so good at trading, that share their, uh thoughts
and you also have the link to buy bits, uh, bonus in the chat also
i do expect a reverse back up to 39, 3996, and potentially, uh, four thousand and twenty for a potential then, uh, break to the downside
well, someone wanted me to look at ape, so we keep going to april, right now
so always look at the higher tiny frames to make sure that we understand what we look at
i already have this horizontal line at ten point six thousand, five hundred and thirty
i don't think we will come back up to that level, though, uh, looking at the candlesticks on the weekly chart, i def because overall, i do believe that we will come back down to 51, 700, around that level
so looking at eight, if we see it pull back to the upside, we need to break this resistance trend line
see the break of the last lower high at eight point one thousand, seven hundred and forty six, potential retest
and if we see now the push to the upside, we can, we can pull back up to nine point four thousand eight hundred and seventy two
potentially at ten point three thousand, seven hundred and eleven, eleven
as you guys know, i still believe that we will come back down to five point one thousand, six hundred, seven hundred
well, would you expect it to pull back up? looking good, guys, it looks good
g can you see what happens when we practice the charts together? can you see how perfectly this entry is? guys, everyone can do this if you just put down the work to it
don't stop yourself, okay? don't let your greed stop yourself from being an amazing woman, a man, human being
see the market for what it is, and the everything will come to you
you know, we need to start questioning ourselves and our behaviors, because that's what's stopping you from being a good trader
lpt, please okay, john, let's see what lpt used it can give us
we retested this previous low, but we are still below the previous resistance at seven dollars on the weekly chart
so we have a pretty, we have a pretty strong level that we are below
uh, first of all, we're gonna, we're gonna, uh, take a fib from 766 back to the low um at 1366
that gives us now fibonacci levels that we are about to come inside at seven, 1565 and 1613
we can also have a bigger pullback up to the previous support
uh, we just might see it back up to 1693 dollars, and then potentially see the the break
but we use the help of the support trend line, because the support trendline is the one telling us that we are still in the uptrend
and as long as we are above it, we can expect the markets to continue back up
we can obviously use different, uh, trend lines on the lower time frames
also, everything depends, um, uh, how you want to break it down on the lower time frames, obviously, but it's always the higher time frame support that will be the one that is really respected
but by just looking at other players, um, we have a pullback right now
so eventually, i do look for the market to reverse back down, so that what we do at the moment is really good
how important is a trend line vs moving average? i don't use moving average
yes, guys, if you have not liked the live stream, please go inside and do that while i look at your charts
and you can help it to grow the channel by reaching out to more people, teach people how to look
i look at the chart in a in a simpler way, because i know a lot of people are super confused, and we're here to help each other
and if you have any friends, etc, that want to trade or are confused, share my channel, because we do, we go through the charts, like charts together
so if you want to help your friends and family, show them this, uh, youtube channel
i know how hard trading is, and i know a lot of people feel alone in it, and that's not fun
and but just, you know, i know that you already know that trading can be very, very, very, very exhausting sometimes
i wish i learned to read candles this good a year ago when my account press, uh, why did i call him? well, it wasn't the time for you to to learn that at that time
we have a demand, so a supply zone right here that we're inside from this candlestick on the daily
so we came back up to previous resistance and also a supply zone
so either we're just going to come back down now and see a potential retest, and then see market try to come back up to these levels again
and then we just might see some consolidation in between 7200 and 6800
but if we start to see that the market is actually reversing back down, now i want, i will, i will, i want to see the uh, gal break 684, because that is the last higher low
so for us to see, okay, we technically this one is the last high low, but i would still use this one because it's a better height, and it's a stronger level that we need to break and then see a retest, continuation, right? continuation rate
but if we see more momentum to the upside based on that a bitcoin is also going up
and if we see that the market breaks this, uh, little resistance that i have, a trend line that i have, and if we break above it around 6900, that can be a bigger push to the upside
but what? to? what level? uh, we just might see the market pull back up to eight point, nine hundred and fifty seven, or nine points and nine hundred and thirty two
but remember that we need to break this previous, uh, this previous supply zone, this previous resistance
and by looking at the charge right now, i'm not sure if that's gonna happen
that's why it's good that we use these different zones to see, okay, do we break the zones and to what direction? because if i would have known, i would say, i would tell you, like, this is how it's gonna be, but i don't know
that's why, that's why we go into the charts in the morning, to see what the market is actually giving us and what type of levels we can break
and that's why these morning live sessions is so good for us to use
because during the day now, when the market will move, we know that, okay, natalie told us that, even though if she's not enough, you know, financial advisor
but if we, if you see the market break down, we need to break this support
but if we see the market pull back up, we need to break the resistance
and then we'll look at these levels for them potentially see a break to the downside
and obviously, if that's the case, because i do have multiple live streams, i will have, i do have another daily update today, and maybe i'll go on another live stream
but if that's the case, you know, we just follow up what we did this morning
okay, so if you are new to the channel, don't forget to subscribe to it
because, as i told you, i am very good when it comes to the technicals
i show you step by step how to how to look at the candlesticks, how to look at the support and resistance zones, etc
so if you want to be a master of technical analysis, you are at the right place
okay? that much confidence i have with myself when it comes to the charts
part one, part two, is also two videos that i would recommend for you to look at if you want to practice yourself
you can also go back to my previous live streams that i did have study and back test ta live also this one, uh, back test with me
and so if you just want to sit and show i do have these live streams because i do back testing with you, also because i want to teach you how i see the market
it's not up to me to tell you, uh, what you want to agree with or not
i only take my time to share my thoughts and my experiences with you, and you do whatever you want to do with that information
you can do it on forex, you can do it on index, you can do it on oil, gold, cryptocurrencies, etc
the only thing that i use, if you want to call it an indicator, is the fibonacci
i will not share my settings on my fibonacci because it is a fibonacci i bought a long time ago from from my very good trader called ken
and by respect to him, because he put a lot of work to that fibonacci
so i'm not gonna sit on youtube and share it, uh, for free for everyone
so just so you know, that's why i don't share my fibonacci with you guys, because i need to respect my mentor when it comes to that
and he will always be my mentor, because, you know, he helped me so much, and i will always respect him
i'm gonna end the live stream right now, because i need to go, because, on twitter, because we do have multiple times, uh, social medias on bitcoin census
cantero, a good day in learning to navigate to deep waters of crypto market starts with natalie
don't forget to go inside and follow, uh, bitcoin census on our different social social medias
i will go into twitter right now and give you some updates about, uh, some charts, and also on tick tock
uh, but we've already gone through a lot of things, so you already know, right? so i'm so happy that you choose to be here
i'm still in, i am in a long position right now on bitcoin, on buy bits, my take profit is at 31 600
you can also receive a bonus on this platform through bitcoin census in me, by up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
you also have it pinned in the chat, so we see each other later
uh, press one, one one in the chat, as always if you did enjoy this morning live stream, if you learned something
they want me to continue doing these morning live streams together with you guys, because i do appreciate them very much
i was a little bit late today, but that was only because i needed to do some things in the morning
so if you want to become a profitable, profitable and good trader, you can be that
so try to figure out what the what the lessons, uh, is for you to learn to become better
okay? because everything that you go through is only a direction to where you should go
okay? so see all of the mistakes as a lesson, as and as a compass to where you can actually, uh, work on to become better
because doing the mistakes is like the best thing that you can do
my name is josh, and in this video, i'm going to be giving you a full rundown on the bitcoin price
and i'll also be updating you on the stock market today, because we're currently seeing new patents and new signals form in the stock market
dollar currency index is getting a rejection from a key range of resistance, which is very important for all bitcoin holders
and nothing much has happened since yesterday on this chance, because we're still seeing that bullish divergence here, which basically means we're seeing reduced bearish momentum here
and obviously this has been the case over the past one week, especially we've just been seeing choppy, sideways price action, as i've been talking about
and alongside this bullish divergence on the daily bitcoin chart, i've also been sharing this bullish divergence on the twoday bitcoin chart, which is also visible on the daily time frame
so once again, i'm mostly expecting more sideways, choppy price action due to these bullish divergences, kind of like what we saw in the middle of last year, or in the first quarter of this year, for example
but if you really zoom into what's happening in the immediate shorter term, taking a look at the six hour bitcoin charts, we attempted a breakout out of this symmetrical triangle pattern, but we did not see a lot of confirmation
because, as i mentioned yesterday, ideally we need to see at least something like a four hour candle close, but we also need to see some sort of retest to flip this previous resistance into new support
so due to the lack of confirmation, we couldn't really be confident that this was really breaking up to the upside, even though it was making an attempt
and obviously, at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is making an attempt of breaking to the downside now
but once again, we haven't seen a lot of confirmation just yet
and in fact, if the bitcoin price keeps chopping around sideways here, it's quite possible that this pattern would simply be invalidated without either price target being met
but if you want to know the technical price targets for this pattern, if we do somehow end up breaking out to the upside, even after this small fake out to the upside, then the technical price target would be coming in at around 36 000
but if we break to the downside, so basically, if we confirm this break to the downside that we're seeing at the moment, then the technical price target would be coming in at around 25 000, approximately, basically revisiting those previous lows that we set around a week ago, but zooming back out to the daily bitcoin chart, we also have to keep in mind that we still have a lot of support sitting at around 28 to 30 000 per bitcoin, which is simply based on the same supports region we've seen pretty much all of last year, holding up the bitcoin price
and so the bottom of this range of supports coming in at around 28 and a half thousand dollars per bitcoin
is a price level that i will be paying strong attention to, because if the bitcoin price confirms a break back below 28 000, approximately, then that would significantly increase the probability of the bitcoin price revisiting that 25k low
and in that scenario, obviously, we'll drop back into this massive accumulation range set in between the 1000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average, which are currently coming in at around 28 000, just above 28k, and around 22 000
and in case you're when you see this channel, the reason why these two moving averages are important for bitcoin is if you simply zoom out to the weekly timeframe, looking at pretty much bitcoin's entire price history, you can see right here that pretty much every single time when the bitcoin price enters in between these two moving averages, that gives us an amazing accumulation range
and seriously, some of the best bitcoin buying opportunities in bitcoin's entire history have occurred in between these moving averages, specifically a little bit closer towards the 200 week moving average, usually marks the bottom for a significant bearish move like a full bear market like 2014 or 2018, which is why i've been mentioning on this channel time and time again that my personal bitcoin strategy is to simply accumulate more bitcoin than normal
if we drop into this accumulation range in between 28 000 and 22 000, and the closer we get down towards the 200 week moving average, the heavier i will be going into bitcoin
and with that being said, taking a look at the nasdaq 100 index on the fourhour time frame
and right now we're actually seeing a bullish divergence form right here
so technically speaking, this could be a good sign for the stock market in the shorter term, because remember, this is only on the four hour time frame, not exactly a large time frame
and considering the fact that the bitcoin price is heavily correlated with what the stock market is doing, this is also technically good for bitcoin in the shorter term as well
because what it actually means is we should be due for reduced bearish momentum in the stock market, at least in the shorter term
once again, looking over the next few days, for example, because if you're looking at the last few bullish divergences we've seen on this chart, right here, on this time frame, we saw one during the middle of march, which resulted in a lot more bullish price action
but that was followed by two other bullish divergences, which were very shortlived
looking right here, for example, we formed a slight lower low in the price action and a slight higher low in the rso and that only ended up reducing bearish momentum for just about one day, until we continued on with these bearish trends
and then we saw another bullish divergence right here, where we saw a lower low in the price and a higher low in rsi
and that did end up reducing bearish momentum, just in the shorter term
once again, looking over the next one to two days, we saw a slight bullish move in the stock market up towards this level of resistance
so that's just to give you an idea of what we could expect moving forward in the shorter term for the stock markets
but if you zoom out to the weekly time frame for the nasdaq 100 index, we just confirmed the fact that we were oversold on the weekly time frame, looking into weekly rsi
and what is really interesting is the stock market wasn't even this oversold during the march 2020 crash, which was a very severe crash
and during the 2018 bear markets as well, we didn't even see the rsi get to the levels that we're sitting at right now
dollar currency index, on the weekly time frame, and you can see that over the past one week and this week so far, we have seen a bit of a rejection from the high that we set at around 105 in the dxy
and this is very close to those two previous highs that we set over the past five plus years
so just by going off history, this is a very common area on the chart for the price to turn around at
dollar currency index is a very important chart to keep in mind is because it usually predicts bull markets and bear markets very well
dollar currency index is moving to the upside, that is usually more of a bearish time for crypto
dollar currency index that happened during the 2014 bear market, entering into 2015, which was pretty much a sideways year for crypto
and then obviously, bitcoin went on to play out that massive 2017 bull run, one of bitcoin's most famous bull cycles
dollar currency index during that same bull run, that was this period right here, that was the entire year of 2017 as the us
dollar currency index was moving to the downside after getting a rejection from this range of resistance
and then pretty much at the beginning of 2018, crypto entered into a massive bear market, which was this time period right here, when the dx y was obviously moving to the upside, crypto was bearish
and that continued all the way up until early 2020, which was that march 2020 crash that spiked the us
and then it was that point right there where the bitcoin price bottomed out at around 38 k, that the us
dollar currency index reversed into a massive downtrend on the weekly timeframe
and during this entire time period right here, which was during the rest of 2020 and entering into early 2021, the bitcoin price had a massive bull run
and then that initial bull run up towards that 65k alltime high that we set during april last year came to an end as the us
dollar county index started bottoming out during that same time period and reversing back to the upside
and obviously, during this time period, during this massive pump in the dxy, we've seen a lot of bearish price action for bitcoin and crypto overall
so the fact that the dxy is now getting a strong rejection on the weekly time frame from this historical range of resistance where we normally see strong rejections, this could potentially be an extremely bullish signal, especially if it continues
because in that scenario, that would mean the next bitcoin bull run isn't too far away

i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
what's up my creative legends? in today's episode, we're taking a look at the bitcoin price
i want to show you how it's the most important week for bitcoin right now, as we are actually holding the value area low from 2021 and 2022
looking at the vpvr, as you know here, holding this major range, we are getting this consolidation
so is it possible to hit 36 or even 38 000 in the next couple of weeks? and i'm going to show you how this is very possible, looking at the dxy holding the support
if we lose the support, this is going to be very good for bitcoin in the next coming weeks
we're also zooming in here on the four hourly, where we can see the bitcoin price getting rejection from these lower highs and hitting that biggest point of control that was also posted on a tweet here on the bitcoin census twitter account
as you can see, getting that rejection from thirty thousand one hundred dollars
let's see what could happen with bitcoin in today's episode, so make sure to stay tuned

and i want to explain how this is probably one of the most important weeks for bitcoin right now, where we are holding the biggest support level from 2021 and 2022
how we are holding this range? okay? we've been bouncing here in 2021 several times, as you can see
are we going to manage to see that relief rally? because we have been dropping, okay, for the last five to six weeks, as you can see here on the threeday chart
so is it possible to have a relief rally hit the 50 percent, or the 618 fibonacci retracement from this big, major drop, and also hit the resistance from these low highs, which would be around about the 36 38 000, if this were to be in the next one to two weeks
and one of the reason why this is also possible is because the dxy has been going absolutely parabolic for the last few weeks
as you can see, the higher lows have been just been going really, really aggressive to the upside
we are actually bouncing at one of the most important support levels here on the dxy
as you can see this white trend line where i do have here, if i zoom out on the daily, it is the lower highs created from 2016 and 2020 actually breaking this level
but what is happening right now is that we have created these higher highs on the price action, and on the rsi, we are seeing actually lower highs, as you can see here on the rsi, lower highs, meaning that these are bearish diversions
the price action here of the dxy is getting exhausted, and we are actually hitting this major support level now for the second time
does this mean that the trend is just about to end with a dxy
but we only need one confirmation, which one the breaking this 102 range, as you can see, which would be the resistance, remember from 2016 and 2020, the lower highs, and also the last big higher low range that we did create the first week of may, as you can see on the four hourly
if we start losing this level, these higher lows, this means that potentially the dxy would be ending a small downtrend, okay, where we could be potentially creating that lower high
and this will be very, very good for bitcoin in the next coming weeks
we might get a big, big bounce from this level in the next coming weeks, and we might see some more bearishness for bitcoin
if we start seeing the dxy this week drop from this level, and i'll be telling you in the live streams, in the daily updates, it's going to be looking very good for bitcoin
and this is where bitcoin potentially could see that major relief rally to 36 or even 38 000 range
okay? so this is something that we're going to talk about in the next coming days this week
remember, for those experienced traders, on buybit, my favorite swing trading platform, you can get up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth a bonus, and zero percent make a fee for 30 days
you should not pay fees for 30 days by signing up with the link down below
there's also a buy bibit airdrop, and make sure to check it out here
and on primex bt, my favorite day trading platform, you get seven percent added to your deposit, up to seven thousand dollars, with bitcoin sensor 50 as the promotion code
i've got full video tutorials of both of these platforms down below, also in the description
and let's zoom in straight here to the bitcoin price on the four hourly
because what i want to show you is that we are creating massive, a massive descending triangle
looking at the four hourly chart, we're actually getting this resistance that we did mention in the twitter account today, okay, where we did have these lower highs with the price action, resistance trend line and a big point of control at the 30 100 range
now we are creating low highs, and we do have a big, big support level
why is the bitcoin price bouncing from this range? this is something that we've been talking about for the last couple of days, is because of the value area low
looking at the fixed range volume profile from this area to this one right over here, the value area
okay, the point of control, it's right over here, as you can see, at that 28 dollars
so if we do break this major support, we could see an aggressive drop on the bitcoin price the next coming days
so the probabilities in actually breaking the twenty thousand six hundred is slightly higher
so we are getting that resistance from these lower highs, meaning that the probabilities and actually rolling down and breaking support here is very, very possible
and i strongly believe that we're not going to successfully break out the 25 400 low here and create a higher low, or actually a double bottom, if we do break this to 28 600 range
but i strongly believe that it is very possible for bitcoin to actually break down from this range for actually getting resistance from this level and coming down
what if we do break resistance? because you might think, okay, we might be breaking the lower highs here, and this is going to be looking very, very bullish
make sure to stay cautious, because this level over here, the thirty one thousand seven hundred and seventy dollars, is a major weekly level
if we go to the weekly here, we can see that these were, these were the weekly lows that we did create back in july, okay, of 2021, where we could get that major resistance
and if we go back to the four hourly chart, it is also the big highs here, as you can see
it's the value area high, which is going to be very hard for bitcoin
now you know, from a range, the value area low and the value area high are big, big, major levels
you can see here this big, major consolidation, as you can see on the bitcoin price on the 10th, on the 11th of may
so if we do break these lower highs, there's no doubt in my mind that there will be a reaction here at the 31 770 range
it's going to be very, very difficult here to break this range
if we do see the bitcoin price hitting that thirty one thousand seven hundred thirty one thousand eight hundred dollar range
because of the volatility, we might be getting a big stop at that level
make sure to stay extremely cautious, because we can see a big, major resistance if we start breaking here, the lower highs
it is also very, very possible after this big, major consolidation
and this last lower high range will be very, very strong support level
so there's going to be major day trade opportunities right there
if we do manage to break this consolidation, and we do have this major weekly they're valuably high
so you want to get into that kind of price action where the price is going to have major bounces from these levels, where you could find extremely good opportunities for trading
make sure to check out the bitcoin sensor website for the latest news and technical analysis ideas
in today's episode, i will show you this inverted hammer that we do have on the two daily charts
i will also show you why i do have this alert, because i just might find a bike positions at these levels for them by the market to the higher time frames, fibonacci levels, where i do expect the market to reverse back down
i will also tell you why i do believe that we will consolidate in between these levels, and me being very patient with putting some buy positions on when i start to see the market reverse back up and hold it to the next alltime high
but please continue looking at this video, and i'll show you exactly what i see right now on bitcoin
welcome everyone that's new to my channel? i'm so happy that you choose to subscribe to my channel and be on my live streams, look at my videos
i want to say thank you for everyone's that already have been subscribing to my channel for a long time
yesterday we did have the first time ever, a back test technical analyst live stream
and comment below this video if you want me to continue do this back testing live streams together with you, because with that we can learn how to look at the charts together, and i can teach you what i already know, and you can combine that with your own technical trading tools, etc
if you like the back testing live stream, please comment below, so i know if i shall continue doing them
if you're looking at the monthly chart right now on bitcoin, it is nine days left of this monthly, uh, monthly candlestick, and we are inside the fibonacci levels between 26 350 and 32 570
so i'm still gonna look for the market from a bearish perspective
um the trend line, this resistance trend line, is really important, because if we want, if we see the market breaking that level, that's when we will change the mindset that we just might potentially have a reverse to the upside
but i don't think that we are done with the bearish momentum yet
so if we look at the daily chart, we can see the market found a support in between the 15 and 61
we can go to the two daily because on the two daily charts, we do have this inverted hammer
when you see the inverted hammer at a support looking like this, this is where we potentially can see the market, uh having the push to the upside
so what we're gonna do is that we need to calculate from where we could potentially see the market pull back up to for a potential retest to create the lower high
because as i told you, i don't believe that we're done with the pullback yet
so i do believe that we could potentially come back up to 31 330 and 31 980
we just might also see the market come back up and retest the 50, uh threemonth fibonacci level at 32 and 600
going to the lower time frames, what we can see, because on the lower time frames, this is where we start to use the other technical tools to see, can we buy the market? can we can we buy the pullback, etc
so if we drag a resistance trend line to connect the dots with the lower highs, you saw the market right now, we're trying to break this level
on the one hourly chart, you can see that we have a a bearish candlestick
so if we see, because now i do expect the market to pull back up to this fibonacci level
so what i do is now is that i take another fit from 29 240 to the 30 135
from these levels, we could possibly see the market pull back up, and we can see the continuation to the fibonacci levels that i spoke about
and from these levels, this is where i do expect the market, obviously, to reverse back down
so what i'm going to do is that i will have a alert if we come back down to this level
because if that is the case, i will actually go in a long position, the thing that we also can do
we can take the support trend line, it's pretty far away from where the price is right now
so what we can do is that we go down either to the 15 minutes chart, and we can use another support trendline just to connect the dots right here
as you can see, we do have this huge, uh, not huge momentum, but it's a pretty volatile pullback that we do have from this resistance trend line
so the case can also be that if we break inside of it, we can say, retest from below, and that could take us back down to to lower targets
if that is the case, we can also come back down to this previous resistance that we also have for a potential retest and then see the market push back up
but if we break that support at 29 464, that could be the the the continuation to the downside
so we just might not see the market pull back up to these higher time frames levels
it is sunday today, and usually on sundays we start to see the the market having some momentum
but based on this triangle that we're inside, and that on the lower on the higher time frames is that we do have this inverted hammer, and we we are at a support
so i would not be surprised if we start to see some movements to the upside
so just one thing that if we see the market having the back to the upside right now, trying to have in mind that it is only potential a pullback, and is not where the market now decides to reverse back up
but if we start to say that we have a bigger momentum to the upside, what we're gonna do is that we will drag the fibonacci back up to this last lower height that we do have, at 39694
so if we have a bigger momentum, we can also come back up to 34 184 and potentially 35 410
and from these levels, this is where we also do expect the market to reverse back down
overall, i still believe that we will break to the upside, but based on that we are inside of fibonacci levels at the moment, i do believe that we will come back down to the support again at 25 800, 900, and see the market consolidate right here, maybe a couple of weeks or so, and then you see the market break to the upside
because after this huge momentum that we've that we've had, because we are inside the fibonacci levels right now where we do expect the market to reverse to the upside
so that is why, for me, i do believe that we can have a push back down, and just see the market consolidating between these levels, uh, being still below this resistance trend line
and then eventually we'll see the market break, you know, break the resistance trend line, starts to create high highs and high lows
so we are right now at perfect levels where i will put a lot of long position and just let the market in the long run, i still believe that we will come back up and create a new alltime high
and even if it mean, even if we see the market being a little bit boring, you just might see the slippage to the downside, etc
and around these levels, this is where i will have my buy limit orders, and i will just hold them till we reach the new alltime high
we just might also, longterm target now, also come back up to 100k
we are definitely in a very good position at the moment where to look at the support, to look at how many fake outs do we have to the downside? and slowly, instead, it will break, break to the upside
and this is why you should also be on my, my live streams, or especially now, when i did my, uh, my back testing video, because i show you exactly how the market is moving when we come to the higher time frames, fibonacci
but we need to have a lot of patience, because if we don't have that, it is so easy for us to lose money
or if we see the market break a little bit, we we sell the market, and we believe that we will come back down further
but what the market is just doing is that it's just consolidating between these levels until it has the power to actually break
don't forget that you can also receive the bonus on private up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
by the this is great platform if you want to hold your position for a long time with the low fees
but i do look for the market to pull back down to these levels for me to potentially, uh, have a buy position, maybe around 29 684
but i still want to see the market pull back down to these levels to see if we actually respect them
and i'll show you that in the live stream that i will have later today
thank you so much guys, for looking at this video together with me
hit the notification so you know when i am live next time, or when i do have my back testing
remember that from monday to friday, every single day, eight am, swedish time, one hour before london session, i have morning live streams where we look at the charts together to see the overview of the day
which is really good, because i have also have so much good feedback from people
and they look at the charts, and the market is respecting these levels

my name is josh, and right now, the bitcoin long positions on bitfinex are at all time highs, with over 14 billion dollars worth of bitcoin flowing into these long positions over the past one month
so in this video, i'll be talking more about that and what it means for bitcoin moving forward
and i'll also be covering some brand new bitcoin patterns in just a moment
and if you're looking at the daily kennel closes, we've clearly seen lower lows in the price action, but higher lows in the daily rsi in the somewhat shorter term here, which is obviously a bullish divergence
and this is actually different from the other bullish diversions i've been talking about in my recent bitcoin update videos
here on the two day time frame, because this is looking at the january low all the way down to the recent low, whereas this on the daily time frame, is zoomed right into just the shorter term price action
but either way, due to these two bullish divergences that we're seeing on these two different time frames
like i've been saying recently on the channel, i do not expect a lot of bearish press action in the immediate short term
talking about a major dump like this, for example, i don't expect a move like that anytime soon
because a bullish divergence simply means we're seeing reduced bearish momentum, which is why we're seeing mostly sideways, choppy price action over the past one week or so, as expected
but looking at the bitcoin long positions over on the bitfenix exchange right now, these are at all time higher levels
and this right here, by the way, is on the three day time frame
so if you're looking at over the past one month, around 46 650 bitcoin have entered into new bitcoin long positions over the past one month, just on bitfenix
and at the current bitcoin price at the time of recording this video, that equates to around 14 billion us
and if you watched my last bitcoin update video, in that video, i talked about the percentage of bitcoin short positions on the buyback exchange, and how when it comes to those short positions on buy bits, normally when we see more people shorting bitcoin, that is simply bullish for the bitcoin price based on history
but that metric that i covered in yesterday's bitcoin update video didn't show the exact amount of money sitting in short positions
it showed the percentage of bitcoin short positions on buy bits, which basically means how many people, or how many accounts on buybit, are shorting bitcoin, compared to the amount of accounts longing bitcoin on buybit
and as some of you might already know, when it comes to trading, the majority normally loses, leaving a smaller group of traders with a lot of money
which is why when the percentage of bitcoin short positions is at an alltime high, it means a lot of people are shorting bitcoin, and it usually means we're in for some sort of bullish move sometime soon, according to history
but this chart right here actually shows the amount of bitcoin sitting in long positions, not the amount of people longing bitcoin
and so for all we know, this could just be a few bitcoin whales longing bitcoin, while the majority are still shorting bitcoin, like i discussed yesterday
and in fact, if you look at the history of these bitcoin long positions on the bitfenix exchange, and what normally happens around the bitcoin price during these different spikes and dumps in the long positions
taking a look at this chart right here that shows exactly that
so on the top half of this chart, we have the bitcoin price on the three day time frame, and on the bottom half we have the bitcoin long positions on the bitfinex exchange on the same threeday time frame
and apart from the recent spike that we've seen over the past one month or so in these bitcoin long positions, the only other time over the past couple years where we've seen a significant spike in these bitcoin long positions on this bitfenix exchange was back during the middle of last year
as you can see, we saw a massive surge in bitcoin long positions going into all of this bearish price action
and then right around the 20th of july, these bitcoin long positions peaked at an alltime high
and that actually happens on the exact day that the bitcoin price bottomed out after all of this bearish price action
and it was during the bullish times where we saw these bitcoin long positions reduce their exposure to the market as we traded it closer and closer towards alltime highs
and considering bitfinex isn't that popular of an exchange compared to something like buy bits, for example
and yet we're looking at billions of dollars entering into bitcoin long positions that have not been liquidated, even on this massive dump that we also saw a similar thing during the middle of last year, even during that may crash
it's quite possible that a lot of the money held up in these bitcoin loan positions are simply wales, aka smart money
that's half the funds available to keep adding to these bitcoin long positions, even during the bearish times
and if that's the case, if this is just smart money longing bitcoin, while the majority of accounts on these exchanges are shorting bitcoin, then this could end up being more of a bullish signal than a bearish one, like what we saw in the middle of last year
once again, and now zooming all the way into the four hour bitcoin
chance to take a quick look at this brand new bitcoin pattern, which is, of course, a symmetrical triangle pattern
and this type of pattern by itself, isn't really bullish or bearish
now, sometimes it can take into consideration the trend as we entered into the pattern
and so in this case, the probability of the outcome for this pattern could sway in the bear's favor
but with that being said, we really just need to wait for a breakout, either above resistance or below support, in order to activate the next technical price target
and right now this resistance line is coming into play at around 303 k approximately, and this line of support is coming into play at around 294 k approximately
and so we need to see a confirmed break of one of those levels, with something like a four hour candle close, for example
and ideally, if we can also see some more confirmation, like a retest, that would be even better
it's just the more confirmation we see, the more confident we can be in the price target getting met
and speaking of the price target, if we break out to the upside, then that gives us a technical price target up towards around 36 000
but if we break support with confirmation, then that gives us a technical price target down towards around 25 000, basically revisiting these previous lows that we set around a week ago
and for the bitcoin traders out there, it does not matter whether or not we break out to the upside or to the downside, because we can make money either way

i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
in this episode, we're taking a look at bitcoin on the weekly and i want to show you how this is really the ultimate level for bitcoin to hold this value area low, as you can see here on the volume profile, that if we do break in the coming weeks, we can come as low as 12 000 in the next coming months
also taking a look here at ethereum, how this is also very, very possible ethereum to have another drop in the next coming months, very likely bearish market, sideways action for the next couple of years, even
and i just want to show you the probabilities of bitcoin actually coming down to that 27 even 26 000 range in the next coming days
and i'm going to explain why with probabilities in this episode
welcome back to another episode of bitcoin centers and news channel
let's dive in here to the weekly chart, guys, because i want to keep it really simple, because we are at the very ultimate level here that should be holding
but if it doesn't hold, with this bearish market sentiment, we got the traditional stock market absolutely crashing
and there's a very high possibility that it will drag bitcoin and cryptocurrency to lower levels
so you need to be prepared for this kind of action the next coming months
and just by looking at the bitcoin chart here, what i want to explain is that if we do break down successfully below the 30 000, okay, a little bit of volatility is fine
we could hold this range, just wicking down to the 25 even 24 and actually recover, okay, if we'd start seeing these weekly wicks
but as soon as we see a strong weekly candle close above below, sorry, the 30 000 area, as you can see, this could be very, very bad for bitcoin and crypto the next coming months, or even a couple of years
and i want to explain just simply, by looking at the value area from the volume profile
we are the value area low right now from this massive, big consolidation range that we have had in between 2021 and 2022, as you can see here on the chart
and that if we do lose this level, why can we come as low as 12 000, where we do have the next big spike here on the vpvr of a major, major accumulation zone
okay? a lot of volume traded at that range back in 2019, 2020
so what if we do break it? why are we going to fall down to those levels? well, it's just simply, as you know, when price action has a big move to the upside or to the downside very, very fast, not having much volume traded at that range, you can slice through and come down at more or less the exact same timing that you have pumped to those levels
so if we can see here down at the round about the 11 12 000 range, we can see since we broke here, twelve thousand dollars, approximately
it took around about ten weeks to come as high as thirty thousand dollars
and it was pretty pretty fast, as you can see, with hardly any retracements here, looking at the weekly and when you have a big gap in volume and you break a major zone, this would be the value area, low, you can come down as fast, alright, as the time you did actually pump
and we have seen this before with price action on bitcoin on the four hourly, on the daily, where you break through these levels, and if there's no volume profile, there's no volume traded at that range, hardly
so this is something that we need to be prepared mentally, because a lot of people have been investing in crypto
a lot of people think that we are going to hold these 30 000, you know, 20k
taking a look at the stock market, the general sentiment is bad, and it can get worse
there's it's always good to diversify and just be ready for this scenario, because it could happen
so just something to be cautious, something to be ready mentally for the next coming months or a couple of years
and this might bring you one of the best opportunities in a lifetime that you could have
and if we take a look at ethereum here on the chart, it is pretty curious, because if we were to go with this kind of four year cycles, okay, with bitcoin, with the halving, now it is, you know, potentially true that after breaking this trend line with these higher lows, looking at the weekly on ethereum, we have successfully broken down this major support of these higher lows with a weekly close, as you can see here on the chart
and what happened the last time, back in 2018 cycle, when we're having this correction? ethereum did correct from 1400 all the way down to 80, okay, at its ultimate low level
this is very much possible, if we do see that bitcoin coming down to ten thousand dollars
yes, of course, you know, ethereum can come well below the thousand dollar range
and what i want to show you here, you know, we have broken this high low trend on the weekly, looking at the logarithmic ever since, you know, we did break this back in 2018
if we were to have this kind of price action, all right, in the next coming months, even to two years, then it would be something like this, right? where we are going to have this big, massive correction, sideways action till we actually see a recovery, potentially in 2023 or even late 2024
and then we might be seeing a big opportunity at those levels to see a huge, massive, big ball run
now, of course, we can see the stock markets, they are correcting, and they might correct
we might see an ultimate crash, recession in the next one to two years
and this is very possible just by breaking this up trend, as you can see, support

i've got two tutorials of these platforms down below, also in the description
because what we were talking about bitcoin here is that we need to break down below the 28 600
yesterday we actually came all the way down and bounced from that exact level
and your question might be, why? well, one of the reasons why is already because you have been marking these lows over here
but the reason why, the first touch right over here, where we did bounce, is because of the point of control from the volume traded well below the 29 000
so we do know that we have been bouncing from this range, but i want to know the volume traded, okay? biggest point of control from this range over here, below 29 000, for those to take a look at those levels where we could bounce
and if we take a look at the fixed, okay, range of the volume profile, if we do take from this range over here, at about 29 000, to this area right over here
we can see that the biggest point of control was at that 28 600
and this is the reason why we are actually getting these bounces, as you can see on the chart
now, why is there a higher probability in bitcoin actually not managing to successfully break above 30 000 in the next coming days? is because you can see here that we are kind of rolling over
it did look pretty good here, where we are creating a higher low, and then suddenly we started creating this lower low over here
so this is why it is very, very likely that we are going to create a lower high here, potentially, and then finally break this major support
it is just very likely it will get broken, and we are going to see that volatility to the downside
now, where can we potentially bounce if we do break that 28 600 major support? are we going to retest as low as 25 000, just like we did here on the 12th of may? well, there is a possibility that we can create a higher low
if i do take a look at the full hourly that we could potentially get a shortterm bounce, okay, which is this one right over here
it is the 27 six hundred range, where we do have this strong four hourly close and open, as you can see
and also, it would be the six one eight fibonacci retracement from the ultimate low here at 252, 253 k
if we do take a look at fibonacci to the ultimate high here that we did create on the 16th of may here, around about the 31 400, well, that 618 would be exactly at that 276, 275, where we could see the price stop, get that volatility at this range, and potentially get a shortterm bounce
if we do get that bounce, of course, in the next coming days, if we do come down to that level and we do bounce, we also can see that we are potentially going to get a rejection from this actual point, from that 28 600, where we did it get bounces every single time
okay? the largest point of control from this volume area, like i just showed you, with the fixed range um volume profile, getting those bounces
so if you successfully break down this range, guys, we are looking for those bounces
we got one right over here at the 276 275 we've also got one here as resistance at the 286 k level
and there is a possibility of continuation to the downside, or potentially creating a double bottom, all depending on how we react to these levels, how much volume we do have
okay, this is something that we will analyze once that happens, of course
and if it's not later, it will be sunday live stream, so we can prepare for monday volatility
check out the bitcoin centre's website for the latest news and technical analysis ideas
my name is josh, and right now, the percentage of bitcoin short positions over on biobit is at a record higher level
and i'll also be giving you some updates on some other bitcoin charts that i've been covering throughout the week
so definitely stick around first giving you a quick update on the daily bitcoin charts
and clearly, at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is holding between this range of support, which is coming in at around 28 and a half thousand, going up towards 30 000
and since there hasn't been much happen on this chart over the past one day, i'll head straight over to the two day bitcoin charts
and i have covered this in recent bitcoin update videos, but if you're new to the channel, this right here is obviously a bullish divergence, because we've seen lower lows in the price, but higher lows in the rsi on the twoday time frame
and the last significant bullish divergence we saw in the twoday bitcoin chart was all the way back here in the middle of last year
and you can clearly see a lot of bullish price action was the outcome from that bullish divergence
but keep in mind, during this time period we were also seeing a lot of bullish price action in the stock markets, whereas right now we're not exactly seeing an overly bullish stock market, to say the least
and so unless we see more of a bullish reversal in the stock market, i would not be expecting price action like this
and instead, i would mostly be expecting somewhat sideways price action, just some sort of choppy sideways range
but if you're looking at the percentage of bitcoin short positions over on the biabet exchange right now, we're basically at record height levels, which basically means right now there are more people shorting bitcoin compared to longing bitcoin over on bybit than ever before
and if you're simply looking at the history of the percentage of bitcoin short positions over on buybit, pretty much every single time where we see a lot of people shorting bitcoin compared to the amount of people longing bitcoin, that usually coincides with some sort of bitcoin bottom, or when the bitcoin price is about to flip much more bullish again
and then we normally play out the most bullish price action as the short positions are closing
because when you close a short position, you basically have to buy back into the underlying assets
so when the percentage of bitcoin short positions is moving to the downside
that usually means short positions are closing, which is adding buying pressure to bitcoin, once again
and during those time periods we see a lot of bullish price action
but considering the fact that this metric is basically at alltime highs, this can also be described as pentup buying pressure
because with a short position, the moment the position opens, the selling pressure gets applied immediately, but the buying pressure, once again, does not get applied until the short position closes
so the more short positions that are active in the market right now, the more selling pressure has already been applied, and the more buying pressure is waiting to be applied
so from more of a longer term point of view, when you're talking about these larger swings in the markets, simply based on the percentage of bitcoin short positions on five bits at record high levels, honestly, this right here is more of a bullish signal for bitcoin's longer term future, talking about months and years from now, potentially
but once again, when you're talking about days and weeks, i'm mostly expecting somewhat sideways, choppy price action
and something else to keep in mind is this massive falling wedge pattern that is forming in the threeday bitcoin rsi
and only over the past one to one and a half weeks, we've just seen a bounce from this line of support, which was coming in at around 26 in the rsi, approximately
and zooming out to the weekly bitcoin chart to give you a quick update on these moving averages and the rsi
first of all, these moving averages are still coming in at just above 28 000 and around 22 000
and so far we've only seen one quick dip in between these moving averages this time round
and we could eventually see a bit more of an accumulation range forming here, especially if we do play outs more choppy, sideways price action while these moving averages slowly rise
and obviously, if you're looking at bitcoin's history, these are the times where you want to be accumulating bitcoin
i'm just simply telling you what has happened time and time again throughout bitcoin's history
obviously, if you bought bitcoin at any of these time periods, you did very well not long after
and a similar thing can be said about the weekly bitcoin rsi, which is currently getting very close to oversold territories
but we are not there just yet, which means, technically speaking, we do have some room to the downside
and if we do end up seeing the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories, that would be an extremely rare signal that we have only seen just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history
and something very similar to that is the monthly bitcoin rsi, which is right now sitting at around 46 approximately
and we've only ever seen the monthly bitcoin rsi reach this low just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history, which were at the end of the 2014 bear market and the end of the 2018 bear market
and as i mentioned yesterday, even during the march 2020 crash, which was an extreme crash for bitcoin, we still didn't even see the monthly bitcoin rsi reached the values that we're at right now
so due to all of that information, my personal bitcoin strategy is to simply dollar cost average into bitcoin to take advantage of this rare opportunity
but i am certainly not going all in, and instead, i'm reserving some extra buying power for extra bitcoin purchases in the event that the bitcoin price might reenter this accumulation range in between 28 and 22 000
and especially if the bitcoin price gets closer towards the 200 week moving average, which is around 22 000
once again, at that stage we'll almost certainly see the weekly bitcoin rsi oversold
but as of right now, i'm simply dollar cost averaging to at least take advantage of the opportunity that we're seeing right now
i'm simply letting you know my personal bitcoin strategy based on all of this information in front of us
and if you want to know how to keep generating profits in crypto even when prices are going down, so that you could keep dollar cost averaging, for example, then these two videos popping up right here on your screen are definitely for you to watch, because both of these videos show you other ways to make money in crypto, whether or not prices are going up, down or sideways
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so is it decision time for bitcoin? is bitcoin going to pump or dump over the weekend, or is it just going to consolidate like it has been for the last couple of days? well, let's get straight into the charts and have a look
so first and foremost, i'm actually going to start on this higher time frame one, which we visited a couple of weeks back
now, what i'm having a look at over here is i'm wondering, still, for the mean reversion play, if there is a possibility, or chance of targeting closer to the upside, uh, of that, which would give you still a decent move, right? so from this level to here is going to be another 26 move uh
not sure whether that will happen, but since price hasn't fallen when the stock market crashed over the past couple of days, i've been wondering to myself, if bitcoin continues to hold like this, maybe there is a possibility that we could get some sort of a pump
now, there's obviously going to be more important levels that we need to clear on a lower time frame chart, which we'll get into now
which will give us confirmation of whether that is what is actually happening
but at the moment i'm having a look at this and wondering, well, if we at least draw a little bit further up, we've got some potential underside rejection around the 37 to 38 000 mark
it's just been stuck in the same sort of range we had the dexi, which is pulled back really nicely
and i said that we need to see the weekly close under the white line at 10337
i mean, we'll see when the markets close later today where we at
i'll have to update you via tweet, because i'm not going to be doing another show until monday
but ultimately, on the dexi, i'm targeting the 10156 area before any sort of a bounce from that level, and probably continuation higher
you can see that it's been support, support, support throughout we broke through, uh, resistance and then support, resistance, support, and so forth
it's been messing around a lot within this area, so i'm nervous to take any longs until i'm sure that it's reholding
but bitcoin is essentially in one of two different scenarios at the moment for the longer term
we're just ranging up and down between that, uh, call it sixty thousand dollar and thirty thousand dollar zone, or it's in a corrective phase
so so far, i'm leaning towards the corrective phase, more because of the, uh, usual 85 percent drawdowns that crypto would experience when going into bear market, and a couple of other other indicators
and then you have the retest of this area so many times, so let's call it major tests of this area would be one, two, and now we're going the third time, and we have broken through
but you can see that it is quite stubborn around the 30 000 area
so until pretty much this level is cleared, i wouldn't feel confident that we are playing the range game where we're going to target back towards the upside
so if we start to clear this 31 300 level, then possibly there is something different that's going on
and if we can close a few daily candles, actually, is what i would want to see above this level, then i'd say, okay, maybe things have changed and we can start to target the top side of this range
but at the moment, any sort of longs are still going to be dangerous territory
and if anything, you should actually be positioning yourself to look for short positions
so let's go on to this lower time frame chart, which is the four hour chart
i'm just going to very quickly clean this up because it's looking quite messy at the moment
i'm just going to delete this area over here, uh, that's got a alarm on
and then i'm going to take this box and i'm going to put it around this whole area, because this is essentially the main range that we're in
so anywhere between currently the low part is going to be 27 hundred and thirty one thousand six hundred price, until it leaves, this is not really doing anything different
and if you are currently trading this, especially uh with your stop losses, for example, you're probably getting stopped uh out left, right and center, and that's going to cost you a lot of money
we clear it to the upside, we're above the green box territory, then we can say, okay, great
you clear that zone, and we can go up to the higher 40 000 levels
and maybe then we're playing back within this overall range, as mentioned
so i'll quickly put in some arrows over there to show you in case this is a possibility of what's happening
so the way that i see it, the next big move is going to be something like this
once we start to get out of this consolidation, we're either going to break down and go much, much lower
uh, don't don't hold your breath on this, at the eleven, twelve thousand dollars
i'm not saying that's going to happen right now, just for the sake of an error, i can put it like that, or we establishing a new higher high and higher low series of candles, which is going to take us further to the upside
until that range gets left, there really isn't too much to say
there'll be a card that will pop up after this video is recorded in the top of the screen
please hit the like and subscribe button if you want to be kept up to date
if you're in cash, that's probably the best position to be in
and if you're looking too short, probably enter your shorts near the top of that range, at the 31 32 000 level
if you're looking too long, and you want along the bottom of the range on a and you're trying to sculpt, then that also does make sense
but for the time being, we need confirmation, and hopefully next week we get that
we're gonna analyze the situation here with bitcoin right away
and of course, i am looking for some potential longs here below this 29 000 range
i am pretty confident that we are potentially going to create a double bottom scenario
and just because of the theory that we talked about in today's video, where we do have high volume on last week, and every time we have seen a local bottom, this is one of the strongest support levels
it's going to be very hard to successfully break down from this range
so it can be, you know, between 27 and 28 000, all right? seeing a reaction at this range, at this four hourly, at the 618 or even the 50 fibonacci retracement from this low to the highs, okay? and seeing that consolidation rhine right at this level
i think it's gonna be very hard for bitcoin to break below 25k, you know, in the next coming days and weeks
i think we can potentially come back down there, but it's going to take quite a long time
is bitcoin going to break? going to break 25k in the coming weeks? guys? and this is something that i want to know, from the community, or are we going to potentially double bottom or create slightly higher second bottom? let me know guys in the poll right away
is bitcoin, uh, going to break 25k in the coming weeks? let me know, guys in the community
i will give you my opinion on bitcoin ethereum, and some cryptocurrencies
okay, it's not a huge, massive dump, but, you know, um, what is it about? a few percentage? yeah, about five percent
five percent dump today, which is, you know, a pretty decent dump
we could already see the big, major resistance, some major wicks here
you know, not managing to get above this range, the highest, you know, the highest point of control, basically this range from the volume traded the last, you know, 10 to 12 days
so we're just range trading, as you can see here, inside of this this level
uh, it's very, very likely that bitcoin, if it does lose the 28 600, okay, it's gonna be, you know, we will very, very likely have another push down, potentially to, you know, 28 or even 27 000 range
i do think that we do have a lot of support, a lot of confluence at that level for potentially creating a double bottom, higher low, you know, two or a higher low at this range
50 of people, 57 people say that yes, bitcoin will be breaking down 25 000 in the next coming weeks
uh, hey, andy lockhart, usdt, what is look at usdt, loka is crazy in in english
we've had a massive dump here, and i think this could go to much lower levels
the reason why is because we're basically creating a swing failure pattern right now
you might think that this looks really, really bullish, because we've broken out from this kind of symmetrical triangle
but yeah, this is not, uh, this is very likely going to continue back down
i would rely more on this swing failure pattern that we have created now right now on locker
this is very, very likely going to continue to the downside, in my personal opinion
um, they have a pretty nice consolidation range, so a potential retest here at the one dollar range, again, is very, very likely
on locker, we had a a failed attempt in breaking this last lower high, as you can see on the chart
i mean, it just gives me a little bit of time so i can send the links and that
slm, uh, what dump says tobias, the dump that we're having right now on btc here, as you can see on the chart, we're having that major drop
you know, i am, i think i'm ready to actually start swing trade, a swing, long swing trade this, uh, start with a very small position on my capital
i'm potentially going to start with point one percent, point two percent
but yeah, i think there is a scenario here bitcoin, you know, not managing to to break below 25k
i think a potential relief rally, you know, to 35 000 or even 40 000, in the next coming weeks, is very likely to get, you know, a little bit of steam
we could, you know, go sideways, have some relief rallies and continue back down
and i think a potential scenario, just like what happened in june, is very likely, just because of the amount of support that we do have here
mark dutch, how are you doing? 28, 26k incoming, says laro pablo
um, why not? why not? i think, yeah, potentially, maybe not as low, but i am looking for a bottom here at some point
and as stu, as soon as we start consolidating, okay, you know, in between the 382, all right, and the 088, i am looking here for a, for a potential low at some point
you know, a nice consolidation at this level would be absolutely beautiful for a potential harmonic pattern
i am eyeing, you know, a potential bat pattern here, where we could get this high over here, this low, this high, which is at the 382 already
if we start dropping, then i am looking for that potential harmonic all right, let's see
what's up? david, how are you doing? joseph, how are you? uh, crushing it with a short 100x
well, yeah, you would want to open a short, okay, basically right over here at this pullback
um, we can see, you know, that we have been creating these, you know, these lows over here, slightly higher low right there
but then you are confirming that the bears are gaining a little bit of steam here, creating this lower low
you know, you can see that failed attempt in breaking here to the upside
you know, this consolidation is already telling me that, you know, there's not enough power
okay, looking at the one hourly, you know, these swing failure patterns are really good to see, you know, who's in control, basically
this was basically at five o'clock central european time, 19th of may, right over here
and you can see, you know, swing failure pattern just right there on the one hourly, showing weakness, showing weakness, getting below and then finally having that dip
okay, so that is confirming, basically, that you are maybe going to get that drop on bitcoin
also, we've got, you know, from this high to the lows, you're basically getting that six one eight consolidation
from the highs to the lows, you're consolidating at the six one eight
so, yeah, it was very, very likely, you know, with the biggest point of control at that range, a lot of confluence
and that will likely take btc to at least 27k in the coming hours
i am looking for bitcoin, i am looking for bitcoin to lose this level
we can see it is the value area low, as you can see, here on the chart from the volume trader the last 12 days, approximately
and also, like i showed you in today's video, i think we got, also, if we take the fixed range from this, from this level
okay, you you want to think, you know, why are we getting supported from this range? well, partly, it's the 382 fibonacci retracement, approximately, from this low to the highs
you're basically hitting that 382, consolidating at the 382 fib level from the lows to the highs
okay, how can you check out? where is the biggest point of control, where you use a fixed range, right? fixed range in between, you know, this candle over here to this one, approximately
and the fix the biggest point of control right over here is at the 28 600
so very likely, you start losing this level, you know, you will see some, some volatility this this range will be very likely, big resistance, support turning into resistance if you do see a successful breakout
and then i am eyeing for that, you know, consolidation at that six, one, eight, the four hourly candle close, uh, for for a potential double bottom
i will be accumulating a swing long position with very low leverage for the next coming weeks
okay, i don't think, you know, remember what happened, and i'll go through the comment section
okay? and it's funny, because me with the mods and, you know, with the community, we were discussing that, you know, may is a selling month
may is usually 75 or even 80 percent of the times it is a red month for stocks, for crypto, you know, for markets in general, it is usually a red month
and i remember talking about this, you know, when we were in this ascending channel right over here, you know, that just the beginning of may, when we're starting to drop, you know, it's just, it's a red month
and we can see that here also in may of 2021, massive capitulation, massive, big selloff in may
people want to sell their stocks, want to sell their crypto to have an incredible summer, right? they want to have, you know, you they want to have dollars
and then in september usually, you know, it's when people, september's usually a bullish month for for stocks in general, and also crypto, because it's after the summer
we can see it right over here in the summer of 2021, of course, where we did have the may selloff, we've had the may sell off right now now, i think we're just going to be range trading in between twenty five thousand and thirty five, forty thousand dollars
it's, there's not going to be enough selling pressure, in my opinion, in the summer, to go to 20k
it's just very likely to to, very unlikely, uh, to happen, in my personal opinion
usually june july is just going to be, you know, range trading
and there is, you know, there is money to be made in this range trading
i don't think that bitcoin will have, you know, the next coming weeks, you know, a drop to 20k to 18k
it's very unlikely in the summer where there's not going to be much institutional activity, simple as that
let's take a look at ing, which is injective protocol, i think
and, yeah, this is, there's no sign that, uh, signs of strength here for injective protocol, we could have that relief rally
of course, we could retest this range at the 360, 360 range approximately
it is very likely to have some kind of relief rally, at least to the point 382 fib level from i would go, from from this high over here, this major drop, um, yeah, approximately
you know, the the the technical analysis on these cryptos, on these altcoins, is absolutely insane, because you basically have a huge amount of of volatility
not the easiest cryptos to do, um, the easiest crypto to do analysis
can you please take a look at kadena for me? let's take a look at kadena right away, see what's going on
i think kadena is is in a massive accumulation zone, basically
i think cadena is basically going to enter a an accumulation zone
uh, in 2021, as you can see, september, october, november, we started started pumping crazy on cadena
we've got a nice volume profile here that could hold as support if you are bullish on cadena
we can zoom in, uh, to the four hourly con uh, full hourly chart, and to analyze the situation here
i think cadena is going to actually come down and retest the lows, potentially, or almost retest the lows
we've got this big, massive downtrend, as you can see on the chart
and, you know, checking out the volume profile, major consolidation range right there
what happens? what has happened after this consolidation that we did create, from the 15th of may to the 18th of may, you had this drop on the four hourly, meaning that, you know, you are rolling back down
you know, you start, you could start adding, adding to a short position at this level in between 270 and 290
reason why is because the amount of, you know, major volume that you have on the, on the volume profile right there, from this consolidation
and you actually can see the support range, this range over here, right? look at this on the four hourly, major, major level
and, you know, this area over here is is a shorting range, no doubt about that
how, from this consolidation you get that balance from this range
so what is going to happen now? very likely, as you are in a very aggressive downtrend, is that you are going to, with high probability, break this low over here, continue back down to see if you're going to retest the 150, or maybe create a higher low, because you're maybe going to get a bounce from this consolidation here as a higher low, or retest the lows
you could see it, you know, that was a beautiful trade just right here, you know, just a few hours ago
looking at the four hourly chart, where you do have this support level at the 280, and you have a massive, big breakout, successful breakout, from two, this was yesterday, by the way, from 280 all the way down to 220 on cadena
so, yeah, once you have this relief rally, yeah, you you are looking for that that short position
so that was a pretty nice short here, just below 280, uh, on cadena
i think it's very likely going to continue down and break the lows, continuation of the trend, my friend
dxy will hit resistance again on the four hourly, says the mighty mustache
you know, it's a theory that i think could happen where we are maybe going to break this parabolic trend
you know, how parabolic can you create higher lows on an asset, on a market, on a chart? you know, you cannot create higher lows like this, right? and this is just about to to get, you know, it is already pretty parabolic
you cannot create higher lows like this, right? uh, it's, um, yeah, it's impossible
basically, you you are, you know, this is already going parabolic
and the dxy could, you know, how far up, you know, it could go further up, of course
um, but if we do start breaking this support, okay, on the dxy, look at this, this higher low on the support
if we start breaking this last lower high over here, a successful breakout, going to the 102, 101
okay? you could see that that is gonna, that is going to be a successful breakout
then we could see a summer, you know, bullish rally for bitcoin
and you also, you know, you you'll be breaking down this lower high from 2020
2017 to 2020, you have a lower high where we did get a beautiful bounce as support
i've checked out divergence on the daily on the dxy, and they do work pretty good
you can see, you know, that we're also creating some bearish divergence on the rsi with, uh, let me just get this out of the way, on the daily, right, where you are creating higher highs and lower lows, lower high
on the rsi, it is true that there's also hidden bullish divergence
but i think, you know, a pretty major correction is very, very likely for the dxy, in my personal opinion
and if this does happen, if we do start breaking this major trend line um below 102, 101, i think that we could see a potential bearish trend for the dxy
but, yeah, how parabolic can this go? you know, how parabolic can this go? you know, there will be a moment that we are going to get exhausted here on the dxy
and, you know, it's just gonna, it's just gonna start a downtrend
will it be this year? will it be in the next coming weeks, the next few months? it's another question that i got for you guys here in the poll, right i see here, is bitcoin going to break 25k in the coming weeks? we have 57 of people saying yes, yes
says, dava, i wasn't here for a few days and look what happens
will it continue? will we manage to break this, you know, higher low trend line and start going sideways, starting having a bearish trend? this will obviously have a good effect on bitcoin
um, can you please take a look at apecoin? says fahim, absolutely let's take a look at apecoin right away
um a coin, apecoin, a coin looks like it's gonna roll back down
it does look like it is about to roll back down, still creating these lower lows, as you can see
yeah, it does look like the apecoin potentially is going to come down at least to the 680
as you can see, we have a triple bottom here on the one hourly chart on apecoin
we don't need to zoom out on on on the on the daily chart, zooming in on the one hourly
what i want to explain here you do have these, you know, you have these slightly higher highs, right? higher lows, sorry, lower highs, high low
what's going on here here? you're starting to see the weakness
so you are seeing that the bearish trend is very likely to continue
you're also creating a lower high, right there here for the last, you know, few hours
this is very, very likely going to break this low, just like this level broke this low over here
and we're going to go to 680, maybe in the next coming hours, in between today and tomorrow
but very likely that we are going to hit those levels, just because of the trend, right? the trend is friend
why is that? it's because it is, you know, big resistance from the past, big support
and if we take a look at fib levels also, i'm going to take a look at the vpvr from the lows to the highs
okay? 618 is round about that 690, 680, where we do have this big resistance that turned beautifully into support right there
this one actually did hit round about the 50 fib level, from the low to the high, it actually hit the 618
so, yeah, 618 very likely to be, um, to be a support level on on apecoin
will we break it? maybe, but there's a lot of confluence right there for for support
and what i want to show you here also, look at this how, you know, we created this, this resistance level
and look how we got that beautiful balance, resistance turning into support and hitting the 618 fibonacci from the lows to the highs, you know, to perfection right there, hitting the six one eight
bang, six one eight, getting that wick, getting that consolidation, getting that movement on the one hourly, seeing the reaction, you know, that was, uh, that was a must quick long this was a day trade right there
so, um, yeah, what is going to happen, very likely, is that we're going to roll back down to to this level
let's see, you know, uh, well, basically we have been getting resistance from this major cluster, of course, big cluster of of volume right there
and yeah, this is very likely just gonna gonna have a pretty nice fall
something interesting that i want to take a look at is, what major support levels do we have, looking at the volume? this is why we've got the fixed range
yeah, from this level to around about this level, where is the strongest point of control? it is all the way down here, all the way down here
from this, from this level to this range over here, yeah, it's all the way down here at the 590
so if this range doesn't hold, we are looking for that bounce at a 590
it's the biggest point of control from the volume trader here, on the 11th of may, 12th of may
is it dumping like crazy? is it dumping like crazy? is it dumping like crazy? um, it is
are we potentially going to lose this level? i mean, i'm waiting patiently
i am looking for longs, but, um, i want to see a reaction, right? i want to see a reaction
and then i'm thinking, okay, the the bears don't have enough steam to push down, but i think they can push down easily to, you know, 28, 27 000, i think so
i'm looking for that 618 fibonacci retracement also, from the lows to the extreme highs
but i am looking this 27 to 28k level to be the the ultimate, the ultimate low, potentially, if, you know, if we start falling here, i'm not going to randomly, you know, get into a trade
i want to see a swing failure pattern to the downside after a consolidation, just like we did have one right over here
look at this swing failure pattern right there, from this consolidation on the four hourly, on the one hourly
so you could assume, all right, in today's video, i am, i'm talking about both scenarios, but we talk also about what is more probable, and it the most, the most probable scenario, of course, is is rolling down from this range, because you actually created a lower low at this point, okay, showing weakness from this higher low
so you basically, you know, not managing to get above this range, creating a small swing failure pattern from this volume traded in between yesterday and today, from these candlesticks right there
you know, i'm not sure if we're going to break down this level
there will be another potential trade opportunity right there
if we do drop heavily on the one audi, close it below this range, have a little bit of a pullback, there's going to be quick range trading at this level
quick, quick scalp day trade positions at this range until you finally get a reaction and maybe a bounce or continue down
the i'm getting some people coming in right now, and explain them how, you know, why this level is so strong
this level is strong because from the volume traded, you know, between the 11th till the 13th of may, this is the, this is why we do have a lot of confluence
because i want to know, you know, what is the biggest point of control, fixed range from this level? okay, the start of this major drop to this range
if we do break down from this level, there's going to be quick, quick scalp day trade opportunity
successfully break down this range, quick, um, trading opportunity
where is renee? he's we got our absolute insane, most bearish guy here, who is predicting an 18 000 bitcoin
one of, one of the guys in the community is calling for 18 000 bitcoin in the next coming weeks
um, is is this the one? this is potentially the one, right where we do have the low? is this the bart simpson, yeah, potentially, potentially
in the weekend, if we are going to see a, you know, a major breakdown of 25k, i don't think that will happen
i am looking for that confluence, that reaction at 27, 28 000
analyzing these small, small cap coins is, let's just see the volatility on this
this low over here created on january, right there, almost almost to perfection
hockey is valued at 0005 cents right now, and zooming in on the four hourly
it just looks like it is ready to roll down to retest the lows here
this consolidation, potentially creating a double bottom, maybe actually breaking below it, maybe a slightly higher low, because the this consolidation is going to act as support
but it's very, very likely that it is going to come down in the next coming hours, next coming days
but okay, luna inu luna, you know, gmt chart, please, says, asif absolutely let's take a look at gmt um, because i actually was in a short position on knc
i did take small profits, but i did get stopped out outbreak here, at break even, because it went above a major resistance level
we can take a look at um kyber network also here in just a second
i see this one coming down as low as low as the 618, which would be around about the 155
one dollar 15 cents, one dollar 15 cents on the way here for gmt token
uh, this is just a classic roll down, classic relief rally, dead cat bounce
and this is just gonna, it's gonna come back down to to potentially retest the lows
the reason why we, we did get resistance on on gmt token at this level
well, something very curious on gmt is getting this big, massive bounce from this, you know, large consolidation, reaccumulation back in march, before we had a massive, big rally
you know, the drop came all the way down to perfection, to that high, to the highs created in march, right? there
we can see the highs right there, massive, big spike on the vpvr there
where did we get the bounce too? we got the bounce to, uh, incredible range that i did actually short this, but i was very conservative with my profits
um, the reason why we actually got this resistance was, we could see a bounce here as support at the 175
and, you know, curiously enough, we did get that relief rally from, you know, if you are going to place a fib level from this range, you know, where would you place it? because you could place, you know, a lot of people get confused, all depending on what time frame, you know, where should i take fib level from this high to this low, from this high to this low, from this high to this low? well, all depending on on what time frames you are trading
it depends on what, what you are scalper, swing trader, day trader, and what i want to show you here
i would for a day trade, for a day trade, or a small swing trade, you know, get fib levels from this bounce over here
on the four hourly, we've got a bounce right there to this low
and i would be eyeing that, you know, this high to this low, you know, hitting that six one eight, six one eight fibonacci right there, getting that reaction from the resistance, as you can see here, and, you know, rolling back down
i did actually trade this, and i was very, very conservative with my with my profits me
for me, always a six one eight is always good to take profits
because this is the thing, you know, you might create a double bottom, no one knows for certain
and it's a major, major level where we do usually get bounces
like i said here, um, you were creating this, um, this symmetrical triangle right there
oh, there's actually, there is actually a a potential garlic pattern here forming on gmt, uh, i did talk about this on one of the videos just a few days ago, where we do have from this high, the low to the high right there
you know, depending, you know, it's a little bit off time, but it still could happen
you know, we did break out from these high lows, this kind of symmetrical triangle, if you wish
you know, this is already confirming that this is very, very likely going to continue to the downside
and, yeah, you basically, from this last higher low on the one hourly chart, you're creating a lower low and a lower high
from this actual high, from this high to the lows, you're already getting that reaction from the six, one, eight, you know, you're already creating a a low here
if it does break down, you do have some, some trading opportunities, quick day trading or scalping opportunities right there
uh, just about, uh, what about five ten minutes ago, apecoin was checked
i remember, you know, this ultimate support level, you know, breaking down
let's go to the threeday chart, where is the largest consolidation right there on ada, you know, from this range, you know, where if we are above this level, the largest level to get a bounce is this one right over here, where we that we did create in january of 2021, the entire month as an entire month of consolidation
so, you know, you would of cour you would get to this level as a big daily level, a big resistance turning into support
and you know, if you this is why you need to get your levels marked up
and, you know, this is you are basically coming all the way down and getting that bounce from this consolidation, as you can see on the chart
but the reason why, you know, the reason why we did drop as fast from 80 cents down to 40 cents, is because back in january of 2021, we went up to this level very, very fast
we went from trading at 35 40 cents all the way up to 80 cents very, very fast
and the, you know, when you see fast moves to the upside in a range, in a range, it's very likely you're gonna get that fast move back down if you break support
well, you do have the big spike on the vpvr of course, as well, because of this major consolidation
you could assume, you know, this is a quick long position right there
you know, if, if if ada does drop down this consolidation, 35 cents, you know, 12, 12, 15 cents, bitcoin will be, you know, if bitcoin does drop below 20 000, you know, we will be seeing all coins like um ada dropping down to about 15 cents
ada is one of those l1 projects that is going to be here in the next five years
okay, so, yeah, i remember, you know, seeing ada at two cents, you know, two, three cents
and if it does come down to that, you know, 10, 15 cent level, wow, that is going to be a very, very nice accumulation zone for the next coming years
ada is one of those l1 blockchain projects that, in my opinion, you know, it's not a good it's not a scam, it's not a pyramid
so if it does go down to that low 10 cent level, it's a very nice accumulation zone
no one guarantees alltime high, but i think ada, i think ada is one of those l1 that will reach alltime high again in the next coming years
um, pretty curious here on the s p we did get the res we did get rejected
we had a huge resistance level here on, on, on the s p 500, which was at the 4 00, 50, 4 070
we actually got resistance right now on on the s p 500 the last couple of days
we basically, we basically touched, we basically touched almost to perfection, this wick over here, created on february
we've got this consolidation area, this was very, very likely going to get rejection and continue back down
s p looking very, very bloody, very, very bloody, hitting the 50 fibonacci, big resistance level here
looking at the daily chart, yeah, it was, it was very likely gonna get that rejection
we had a big, aggressive downtrend creating lower lows, lower highs um, yeah
that was a a very likely lower high to be created to continue down on the s p 500
we must have been talking about this level over here, because we got back inside this descending channel, back inside, you know, i was looking yellow
um, so, yeah, what is happening right now is, yeah, yeah, it's dumpy action time for the s p 500
but we might open with a huge gap on monday on on the s p 500, trading at 3 800, 3 800, 3 700 points
we haven't been trading at this level on the s p 500 since, um, yes, since march of 2021
i think this is why we're also getting this um, we're getting this support right now because of this major low created in march
it looks like we're going to see some continuation, by the looks of things on the chart
uh, it seems like bitcoin cash is having a severe drop by the looks of that emoji
what will happen? remember, we got the biggest support level right now on bitcoin, which is, you know, from this range
this is that bart simpson pattern, getting ready for that, for that dumpage for the weekend

i think we are maybe going to retest the lows, almost the lows here, as low as 150, all depending on bitcoin
so, yeah, i think we are potentially going to, you know, at least the six, one eight from the lows to this high
but yeah, i think, you know, i am looking for that double bottom on bitcoin with a slightly higher, higher, second low
of course, if we start falling here aggressively, i'm not going to randomly get into a trade here for a long position
and my take here is that we are very likely going to get a reaction from the 618, from this low to the highs
i'm looking for that twenty seven thousand six hundred dollars, slightly below twenty eight thousand dollars, see if we can have a reaction there
if we start reacting, i will be bullish, because i know the deal
because a lot of people, you know, you thought that we were going to get a bounce here, yeah, but only if, you know, only if we do get a reaction, then i will be very, very bullish
looking for that, you know, double bottom scenario, looking for that potential harmonic pattern
i will talk about it once we see this reaction here, because then we could have a big, massive, you know, relief rally
if we do create that higher low, there's going to be a pretty insane harmonic pattern, right there
um, a really good harmonic pattern that we did find out about was this one right over here
do you guys remember this bat pattern over here, right? and actually traded this all the way down here, getting a beautiful bounce right there
all the way up here to the 42 000 range was a pretty, pretty nice trade
i will talk about it once we create the higher low and potential movement that we could have on this map
we are getting, we did get above this range, massive, big fake out right there
we did get one bounce from this resistance turning into support
i'm talking about the 44 000 range created back here in february, march and april
we did get that balance here once, you know, we had pretty nice trades here in this range
and what i want to show you here is that this was, you know, this was a spring point in the end, right where we did have a fake up from this level, big level
you're thinking, okay, we're going to go to much lower levels
and i have a feeling, you know, but in a much larger time frame, we are
we are breaking below this range, and it's not a successful breakout just yet
so something like this, you know, breaking out from a major resistance, coming back down, you know, we are breaking from one of the biggest support levels, and it's not a successful breakup just yet
i think we could consolidate and have a have a relief rally in the next coming, coming weeks
i don't see bitcoin successfully breaking down twenty five thousand dollars
guys, you know this, and it needs to, you need to have reasons why
and, you know, reason number one, just one big reason would be looking at this coin based chart
and the, you know, shout out to kevin as benson here on this, because he's been talking about this weekly volume, you know, predicting a potential bottom or a high, local high, or local bottom on bitcoin many times before
he was already talking about this local bottom over here when we did have the spike on the volume
and pretty insanely, you know, this is um, it's pretty cool to see
pretty cool to see how how um, you know, this has been predicting bottoms, you know, these spikes in volume, local bottom, local high, right there
can this time be different? yes, of course it can be different
even though we did have a massive, big spike here back in 2018, in january, we had a big insane relief rally, a big insane relief rally
it was a local bottom for a long, long time, uh, back in january
so this is why i think, you know, we're not going to successfully break down 25k in the next coming weeks
it's just very unlikely, just by looking at how volume works here on the weekly potential local bottom
i am not saying that we are not going to break down 25k, because that might happen in september or october
i just think it's not going to happen yet, because looking at past performance, uh, on on all of these, you know, past performance doesn't mean if you know future results
yes, i do know that, but you know, how many times you have accurately seen this happen where you do have the spike in volume? you know, it's, it's 8 out of 10, or or 9 out of 10
so, you know, the chances of this being a local bottom and having a big relief rally and not breaking successfully below 25 000? can we retest that range? yes, we can
but not break having a downtrend for the next coming months? it's very, very unlikely, uh, before at least having a relief rally for some weeks, a pretty large relief rally
anyway, something that, you know, for people that are new, super important thing, you know, to to to take a look at
we cannot ignore this big spike in volume, you know, that has, you know, predicted local bottoms, it all tops in the past
it's just, look how many times, you know, one, two, three, four, you know, uh, you we cannot ignore this
we were talking about that roll back down on kyber network, and i got stopped out that break even
we did get a small pullback, almost touching the highs here, almost touching the highs from this, uh, consolidation
and i made a video just when we were trading at 240, and after the video, we were getting that correction
i took some profits, uh, while we were coming down, and then it suddenly turned around, and and got stopped out at break even
you know, people, and this is for hodlers, you know, make money buying low and selling too soon
millionaires are made buying low and selling too soon, because a lot of people just don't sell, and huddle for years and years
and you might see your portfolio go absolutely, extremely high and then extremely back down without taking profits
and this is something, you know, my trading has improved a lot the last, you know, few months, just because i take profits too soon, and sometimes it's worth it
and because, in the case of kyber network, it was worth taking profits, and it was, you know, worth putting a stop loss
and one of the reasons why is because we are above a major resistance zone
this has been such a strong resistance level, the 240 right there
but after such a severe drop, you know, the relief rally can be a little bit higher
um, you know, if we, if you were taking a look at kyber network, keeping it pretty simple
we are above, we are above the the value area from the volume traded in between 2021 and 2022
i would be cautious while the crypto market sentiment is is bearish
has been bouncing as resistance several times as support also
we got a big support right now on kyber network at this level, at the 240, 240
looking at the one hourly chart, um, we could get that bounce
maybe, maybe, can you take a look at gmt? rich wilson, thanks for the super chat
rich wilson, thanks for the super chat, but i'll take a look at it again, because, just because of the super chat
rich wilson, gmt, i think gmt is very likely going to roll down
one of the reasons why, right now is because we're basically below the biggest point of control from the volume trade of the last 12 days, which is right over here at the 143
you know, we were at the value area high approximately from this, from this big mountain, just, um, yesterday, early this morning, actually
and the reason why, you know, we had a kind of symmetrical triangle right there on gmt
and you're actually breaking below the the the last lower low here, the higher low, sorry, so you break you're making a lower low
this pullback or over here, was already a are very likely going to roll down just because you printed a lower low
and with price action, this is what you want to take a look at
very likely to happen is we're going to hit the third retest on gmt at the 130 right now, very likely in the next coming hours
and, you know, then where what could happen? we could actually retest the lows
we could actually get a balance from the 618, which is a very, you know, common bounce level from a low to the high
so we could get that balance, and this is exactly the 115 cents
so if we do break that low, what could happen here on gmt is you break down
you hit that important fib level from the lows of of may, of the 12th of may, to the highs six, one, eight
you come back up and retest the big support level at the one dollar thirty cents, which will be a strong resistance
there are some, some trades to be made if you do lose their 130, uh, 30 cents
i would be potentially taking profits at this 125, one dollar, 30 cents
dollar pair here at the one dollar fifteen cents, several bounces
so there is a potential, you know, scalp day trade opportunity there
if you are interested in trading, you got a an incredible deal down below on buybit
is also another way to help me, of course, because i get small commission, and i this makes me continue

are we going to manage to successfully break down the biggest point of control from the volume traded in between the 11th and 13th of may, which is exactly at that to any 28 600? if we break down, guys, there are some opportunities here
i am going to think that we are going to maybe create a higher low
if we do get a reaction from that 27, 28 000 range, i am going to be very, very bullish

what's up my crypto legends, in this episode, i want to talk about the bitcoin price on the weekly chart, going through again this scenario, okay, where we do have a big spike in volume on the weekly indicating a potential local bottom for the next coming weeks
and shout out to kevin's benson, because he was one of the first analysts talking about this a long time ago
we're also going to jump in here to the one hourly chart, because we did actually break down from this higher, low, ascending channel, as you can see, not too much volume
i'm going gonna explain why we did get this bounce, okay? because we are the value area low
and i'm also going to show you here some pretty interesting facts that why we did, we are getting this balance, okay, from this major level, all explained in this episode
and what is the bitcoin price going to do from this range? because we are at the highest point of control right now
so are we going to go up, or are we going to go down? i think probabilities are higher to the downside, and i'm going to explain in today's episode why
now, like i showed you, we are in a kind of a descending wedge where we do have these lower lows
and i just want to show you the price action from january, because if you were, you know, trading in january, you probably thought that this level, these lower highs, we're going to roll back down and retest the lows
and we actually had a big, massive pump, okay, gaining the last lower high
and i want to show you how this is very, very possible in the next coming weeks, okay, where we could, again, all the way up here, the 40 000 area, all right, where we do have one of the highest point of controls
it does make sense that we are probably going to hit those levels, all right, and get heavily rejected
if we do go up there, it might be a very good shorting opportunity, guys
and i think a big relief for ali is very possible in the summer
it has been pumping since the summer of 2021, and it has been going parabolic, as you can see with these higher lows every single time
and now we are at a critical resistance that if we do break it, we'll be breaking the uptrend structure
i'm going to show you what levels we need to break as support
so then this might be good for bitcoin in the next coming weeks, if we see a potential downtrend in the dxy

and first of all, shout out to kevin benson, of course, because he was one of the first analysts talking about this for many, many years now, actually, he's always, you know, looking at the potential big volume on the weekly on coinbase, and saying that, you know, this has always indicated a local top or a local bottom
because if i just zoom in here, the last few years on bitcoin, as you can see, i got this yellow horizontal line
i just want to go through this for any new subscribers, anybody that hasn't been paying attention, because this is something that you cannot ignore
technical analysis is all about probabilities, all about stuff that has happened in the past
looking at this weekly volume, we can see the spikes all right, in volume, all right, indicating a local bottom or a local top
we pumped after these spikes in volume, as you can see, we do see the may of 2021, big, massive dump
what has happened last week is that we did get this big spike in volume
we haven't seen a spike in volume like this since one year ago
this is may of last year, indicating a local bottom, like in the past
the weekly closing above of last week, above the thirty thousand dollars
this is why we are potentially not going to break successfully down this thirty thousand dollars for the next coming weeks, because we are looking for that weekly bottom, like i'm showing you here on the chart, guys
so this is something that we do not need to, okay, ignore because, you know, i would say it has eighty percent of probabilities, looking at what has happened in the past, most of the times
so this, i mean this, i think it's something that, you know, it's undiscussable
you cannot make this up, right? take a look at bitcoin on the one hourly chart
we can see, all right, that we didn't manage to break below this low over here from this kind of ascending channel that we did create, as you can see, higher highs, higher lows, breaking down, no volume at all
and you might think to yourself, why did we get this bounce from this level? well, reason number one is, because you can see here, we are getting supported from this range, all right? from the 14th of may, already getting a balance
it's because of this volume, all right? and if i take the value area, okay, the fixed range from this area, all right, i would go from this candlestick to this one, because i just want to know these levels, okay, where is the highest point of control? and you can clearly see here on the chart, it is this red horizontal line
the biggest point of control here is at the 28 600 and this is the reason why we are getting a bounce from that range
it is the biggest point of control from the volume traded, all right, below 29 000
so this volume trading range, biggest point of control is the reason why we're getting this balance and this breakout from these higher lows
we're actually getting a slightly higher volume right now inside of this channel
we actually, you know, consolidating above the biggest point of control from this volume, uh, traded range
so, you know, there is a possibility that we might get a rally from this level
and you know, the the probabilities are slightly higher and actually coming down from this range, because, you know, we are actually in a big, aggressive downtrend
you are looking to get gravitated back down to these low levels created on the 12th of may
but what if we do get a massive bounce from this range? now, the probabilities, like i said, are slightly higher and actually continuing to the downside here, slightly maybe hit in 28, 27 000, or even the lows here around the 26, 25 000 range
it is very possible for that double bottom, which i strongly believe could happen
remember, for all of those experienced traders, by bit my favorite swing trading platform, you can claim up to four thousand and fifty dollars worth of bonus and zero percent
if you sign up with my link for 30 days, you also can get an airdrop, okay, on the ethereum usdt, perpetual, if you do have more than 10 us
and also, you've signed up with my link, the information is right over here
also, in the description, if you want to claim this airdrop primex bt, my favorite day trading platform, up to seven thousand dollars, you basically get seven percent added to your initial deposit to trade with with bitcoin sensors 50, as a promotion code
i have four video tutorials, also from these platforms down below in the description
but there is also a possibility that you might pump from this range
and the first example, and the only example i want to give you, is this right over here
this chart over here is, you know, the bitcoin price on the four hourly
and we can see this descending wedge, okay, with the lower lows, as you can see, and also the lower highs
okay? so it is forming a kind of a descending wedge pattern that will go to the end of the apex here at the end of the summer, around about august
we could be breaking down or up well before august, of course
but what i want to show you is that we are getting supported from this trend line, right from these lower lows
and it is also a major, major level, like i showed you in other videos
so volatility at this level, but maybe not potentially breaking down successfully, like i showed you also on the weekly probabilities
and actually not breaking below 25 000 successfully is very, very high
so zooming back in here, what i want to show you is the real reason how that we could actually pump from this range
all right, we need to take a look at the bullish case scenario too
because i bet you were very, very bearish at this range here on bitcoin
this was january of 2021, first of february, where you were in a very aggressive downtrend here, as you can see on the chart
and you thought that you might going to get this dead cat bounce, okay? you're going to roll back down to retest the lows here from january of 2021, which was around about the 33 000
and if i zoom in, what happened right over here is that you actually had a huge, massive bounce from this range, gaining the highs, massive liquidity grab above this last lower high
and you catch a huge amount of traders, you know, getting above the last lower high, the amount of stop losses at this range would have been absolutely insane
if you take a look at fibonacci, from this high, you know, to the lows, you're basically hitting that 50 percent, almost the 618
you actually break down also from the higher lows, you know, very, very similar kind of movement right now
i know, i think a lot of people are thinking that we're going to go to much lower levels, very similar
we, you know, we have the higher lows, higher lows right there, breakdown, and then we go straight to the other side
so the possibilities and this happening also is very, very high, right where we do have also this kind of higher low area like this, as you can see on the chart
and it does look like, you know, potentially we are going to see maybe something very, very similar
we've been in a very aggressive downtrend here for the last four to six weeks
okay, as you can see, so you everybody's expecting that roll back down, that retest of this low
a lot of people are calling for sub 30 000 um, bitcoins going sub 25
and you know, this is very, very possible also, where you think you're going to roll down, guys, stay cautious with trading
and i want to, i've got a theory right now, okay, because, you know, there is a possibility that bitcoin might go to lower levels, but my theory here is potentially forming a harmonic, which i go will, i will go through in the next few videos
if we do create that higher low and break here the highs, i'm going to show you which harmonic it is
but the reason why bitcoin can dump and get a big, massive relief rally in the next coming weeks is also because of the dxy
dxy is such an important chart, because it has correlation with bitcoin
and it's not instantly, but it does have a correlation in the weeks
okay? so if i zoom out here on the daily what i want to show you here, most importantly, is that the dxy broke a, you know, multiyear trend line from back in 2016, we created this lower high, this high, sorry, and then this lower high back in 2020
we broke this trend line, all right, as you can see, to the upside, and successfully got a bounce as support
what is happening right now on the dxy? we've got that beautiful bounce, as you can see here, to the exact dollar, to the exact scent, as you can see on the dxy chart
and it's, what is happening right now on the dxy is that we are having some bearish divergence, but we're also having some hidden bullish divergence
but let's go with market structure, because we have been, you know, look at this, these higher lows, higher lows, higher lows, every single time
you know, big, massive trend line getting supported and actually going parabolic
the trend line is going parabolic with the higher lows, as you can see on the chart
okay? and if we do break this trend line, if we break this last higher low, which is at the 102 points levels here, as you can 102, if we break this low, if we break this up trend structure, this is going to be absolutely beautiful for bitcoin
this is when bitcoin will have that major, big relief rally in the coming weeks
now, the reason why i think the dxy, sorry, the bitcoin price, can dump from this levels, potentially retesting that 26 000 range, okay, plus minus a few thousand dollars
the reason why is because we could retest that range, is because what if the dxy right now is going to pump and is going to create a lower high? of course, this is still speculation, but this is very, very possible
what if we are going to create that lower high and finally break these major support levels, this major uptrend, this major last low, the resistance here from, uh, the last few years of the lower highs? you know, it's very, very possible
if this does happen, this is going to give bitcoin a huge relief rally
this is something that we are going to take a look at in the next coming days, because it's going to be absolutely insane
it will give confirmation for bitcoin, all right, to have that big relief rally for the next coming week
i just answered you, uh, from this morning live stream that i did have
i don't know what, what is happening with youtube, but they did close that video
and i spoke to um, i spoke to the support and they said that they've been having a lot of people, uh, telling them about the the same thing, that they didn't allow the video to be public, and i can't change it
but they didn't allow me to have the, they did not allowed me to have the video public
i mean, i didn't do anything wrong, but maybe it's just something wrong with youtube
but that is why my video from this morning live stream doesn't work now
i don't know what's happening with my ears, but i can't, i can't hear anything
if you haven't already like the live stream, please go inside and do that right now
and then we're gonna go into the charts and look and see what's actually happening, because we came back up exactly to the fibonacci levels, um, exactly to the fibonacci levels that i did expect the market to, uh, to go into
and they just have to do something, because it starts to get really annoying you fix it right now
uh? will it break or danny? danny, okay, so let's see, we had this huge drop
i did not expect that drop to happen, but obviously we were in that level
the market is just jumping, um, but to potentially where we just might drop this off
how are you? okay, so we did come to the fibonacci levels where i did expect the market
um, i talked about this in this morning live stream, but also on twitter this morning and on t uh, tick tock, uh
on bitcoin i said, ethereum, could consolidate between 20, 2060 and 2150, and see if we, if we see various reversal patterns inside fibonacci levels, we can drop back down down to 1520 next week
the only thing we didn't do was that we did not consolidate in between these levels
but the market came up and retested it fifty percent, precisely at two thousand and sixty, as i told uh, 2016
so if we just go down to the lower time frames, just to see what actually happened and see what we could have done, because that is the most important thing
how are you? what could we have done on the 15 minutes chart? break, retest
break, retest of this level from this high, uh, from this highly low, connected to this highly low
so i was waiting for the market to to break, uh, 29 990, and then expect a pullback
usually what i wait for the market to do is come back up a little bit more and then see the market and then i would have sold the market
why are you shorting the market when the market is doing the move? why are you jumping in the market right now? if you do that and market goes up for a pullback, what are you gonna do? that's not that, i mean, you can do whatever, but you never sell the market when the market is right here
oh, okay, more i'm like, why are you okay, if you did it from this levels, that would that's good
but the market on the high, on the daily chart, doesn't look good at all, to be honest
but obviously, when you break everything down to the lower time frames, we aren't inside the consolidation market at the moment
i can say that we just might, potentially, these couple of hours, gonna come back down to the support again at 28 672
what could take my profit? i don't know what is your take profit, guys, if you're jumping into trades and you don't even know where your take profit is going to be, i'm just asking one question, how do you think having i mean, if you've been on my live streams, you know exactly
because if you don't use the fibonacci, i've already, i've said two million times what you should do
yeah, i know you're here to learn, guys, but when you, when you choose to go in before you even know where your take profit is gonna be, you cannot put that on me, that you're here to learn
isn't that what you do when you i'm not, i'm not trying to be rude, but you, you're gambling if you do that, and that's not serious
and when we go to the daily chart, we did break this previous resistance at 103640
what i did was that, um, what i did was that i also took a fibonacci from, was it this low, this high, from 103 points 896 to the low at 102700 something
i did that, uh, i did this when i was actually laying in the sofa looking at the charts from my phone
so we just might pull back up to 103320 and potentially 103454
but the thing is that if we come back up to these levels, that could be the potential, uh, lower high
and i actually see dollar com come back down to 102400, or potentially, uh, 101 points 865
if that is the case, bitcoin will just go down now and potentially come back down and then pull back up
yeah, that could definitely happen, and then you see the drop
as lauren said, they, they, they told me they're working on it
and it's a lot of other people that also have the same problem
so i actually don't know, i tried to open it up, but it doesn't, it doesn't work
i hope this live stream will be, i hope this live stream will be better
i'm not sure what youtube spot is up to, but let's go into the charts again, and we're gonna look at ethereum, first target that i see us coming back down to is 1910
but if we do it like this, we drag another flip from high to low, down to the lower time frames
um, so if we use this fibonacci level, because we also did retest that one, we could potentially come back down to 1870
but first target that i can see is coming back down to is definitely drop back down to the supports and from that level, uh, we're just gonna look to see if we find another lower high
because, as you guys already know, i do believe that we will fill this week, back down to 1690
so that's what i see on ethereum, guys, if there's any coin that you want me to look at, please do that
i don't i'm not gonna have this live stream for so long, because my ears are killing me
i actually think i have to go in because it does not feel good at all
i had a problem with my my my right ear, and now i have it on the on my left ear
but we can do a recap of the coins that you want me, wanted me to do this morning
uh, we did already go into dxi, uh, elham, so you can just go back a little bit, um, but if we're just looking at still, i'm gonna go through the ones that you want me to look at
we did break it a little bit, but we saw the market break the support
even if i didn't call it, but i did speak about the support trendline
and now, what did you want me to look at? um? cardano, i'm gonna look at cardano, okay, so last time, perfect
so sometimes, as you guys know, when i look for the traits, when i when i look from my own trades, what i do, we could def this could definitely happen
just because we say, pull back, we can still find another lower high
and not right now though, because the market has already done a move
and usually the marquee gives us the pullback, and then see the drop
do we have anything today? did we have any news coming out today? that's the most important thing
you think you said that this morning? that your new welcome so, yeah, on ada, we're just dropping
we can obviously come back down to the low at zero point four thousand eight hundred and ninety
if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that right now so we can reach out to more people who will be super nice of you
if you haven't already subscribed to my channel, you should definitely do that so you know when i am live
i have live streams every morning from monday to friday, 8 00 am, swedish time
i do these morning live streams because i want to go through, and that is what we did already look at these levels before the shoes drop, right this morning
and that's why it's really important for me to go on, uh, go on before london session opens
so subscribe to the channel, so, you know, hit the notification
you also have this, uh, hanging man with inside the fibonacci? so great
i'm just, i just show you now what happens, because the move has already
but this candlestick right here on the one hourly chart was actually signed to sell the market, because it is an inverted hammer
so if i would have seen this, i would definitely have sold the market
um, so where we can go? now, as i told you, i do believe that we will come back down to 14 470 and 1330
i don't have any setups at the moment because we can see the drop
i cannot give you anything, because i need to see the pullback for me to find an entry
what about the trend line is broken? you wait for the lower high on the small time frames, and it doesn't happen like now
we almost came back up to these fibonacci levels, but it didn't happen
why am i spending my time on this crap? i don't know why you do that
well, another good thing that we saw right here is that we came back up to the highest time frames, fibonacci levels
but another thing that i did was that now i took another flip from that that high, back down to the break of the low market came up exactly
take profit 2 got hits at right now, at 01 500, we can go back down new to, uh, we can go back down to zero point one thousand four hundred and twenty
and so, yeah, just let the market drop do whatever it's supposed to do
uh, on the high time frames, i still believe that we can come back down to the to the support at zero point 1 345
we can also come back down to zero point one thousand seventy seven
so when people are rude, i'm just taught how to how to give the feedback to them
yeah, we were looking at this, we this morning down to the lower time frames right away
uh, looking at aave, we see the drop back down to potentially the support at 84
so what we're going to do is that we're going to use this previous high that we do have at 93
so if you don't know what a fake out is use the previous resistance
when you break that resistance, what happens is either you come back down and retest that resistance, turn it into a support, and then you see the market push to the upside
so what could potentially happen is that if we see a pullback, you can come back up and retest the exact same previous resistance that would try to fake that the market tried to fake out us from at around potentially 92 dollars
and so that could definitely be a sign to go into, uh, for me, to sell the market
but i would wait for the market to do the pullback, because right now you can see the drop
but it's definitely something that [Music], sorry guys, my echo
but we could definitely pull back up to 92 dollars again and then see another drop
uh, we came back up to the fibonacci levels just to look at and see how the market did
how are you? i'm just, i don't know why i always start to speak english when you're here
so some people are a little bit confused how to use the fibonacci, how to use the trend lines
so usually what i do have is that i have my fib on, my trend line, against the the candlesticks bodies
but when you see the retards like this, what we can do is that we just drag down, uh, to the wicks, and that's when you see the break retest, and then you see the drop
so everything depends on how how comfortable you are with playing around with the with the the technical, with the technical
that's why, london, in the house, i heard someone was trying to bully you, but i remembered you got this, yeah, to my shift, and it ends up me bullying them
first of all, yeah, we can definitely come back down on magic, back down to 0600
and during the weekend, you just might see market come back down, and then you see the market potentially in between
and usually this is actually what happens before, um, the weekend happens
and then you see the market very, very slow and on for on sunday, you see the movements again
we just might also, obviously, see a pullback back up to this previous resistance, that support, that would they break around 0643, and then see the the retest and then the continuation to the downside of the drop
but on ape this morning on twitter, i gave that either we break the resistance trend line, and you see the market potentially pull back up to ten point six thousand five hundred and thirty, or if we break the support trend line, which i did kind of expect the market to do, but, you know, i had to, i i sometimes it's great to give you two options to see what could happen, because you can obviously also see the market drop
but if you drop from here, the longterm target, i do believe that we can pull back down to around five points and 980 dollars um
we can just adjust the trend line a little bit on the lower time frames and see what's happening
what we're gonna care about because the market looks the same on every time frame
now, from the high to the low, market came back up exactly and retested the 50, as you guys can see right here
but the market, as i told you, has already done the move, uh, on the lower time frames
if we see a pullback, we can use the previous but we don't have the pullback yet
so, but usually what i do is that i use the pullback from we use the previous high to the next lower low, and that will calculate where, potentially the next lower high can be, and then potentially see the the continuation of the drop
if you haven't liked the live stream, please go inside and do that, so we can reach out to more people
if you have not already subscribed to my channel, you should also do that
i use marketing structure all the time, combined with the fibonacci
so if you are confused, which i know a lot of people are these, uh, these
and don't forget that you can also receive a bonus on pivots up to four thousand and fifty dollars by using the link in the description down below the video
you can obviously day trade it also, but it is a good platform if you are a swing trader and if you want to hold your position for a long time with very low fees
so, like now, when we look at ape, you can see that we do have a pullback
you just might see pullback up to seven point eight thousand and thirty, potentially seven point eight thousand three hundred and fifty three, because you have such a momentum now to the up to the downside
everyone should know the only thing that separates your inner ear from your brain is a piece of tissue that thinks
not i'm a new subscriber already to profits just by watching your videos
yes, if you haven't liked it's 154 people on this live stream
please go inside and like it so we can reach out to more people
we came up exactly and retested the fibonacci levels really, really good
but you'll see the market slowly instead, it come back down to these levels
usdt, so we drag the fibonacci from 6346 back down to the low at 4020
i mean, it's good, but it's kind of boring because i already know what to do
you know, we want to, we want to work with the brain a little bit, see what's happening on the charts
if we see the market pull back up, you you see the market give us a green candlestick, what we can do is that we drag the fib from this high at 4714 to that low, wherever that can be
and that will give us fibonacci levels where we potentially can see a quick retest and then see the drop
but the market is not giving us any green candlestick at the moment
now, okay, what else? what do you want me to look at? near? we're going to look at near near usdt go to the high time frames
we're gonna use this previous resistance that we are just about to break on the monthly chart
so if we break below 5560, we can drop back down to, uh, four point 173
so what i did was that i took a fake from six point six hundred and eighty to the low at five point five hundred and seventy two
and you can see that take profit one, two, three is exactly between these levels
so i definitely believe that we can come back down to four points 120
and take profit three is, oh yeah, four point two hundred and twenty four
long uh, how are you saying besta the best community? besta community
i just showed every pump that happens while a bear market, and that's been working beautifully
solana, i don't know if someone asked about solana, but i think so
people fully with a double double bottom will be the huge momentum to the upside
but i'm here to tell you, back test double bottoms, and you'll see that after the drop, after the double bottom, the market goes down
so this is also one thing that, this is also one thing that we need to have in mind
you know, when you, when you google things about trading, like it kind of makes sense, but it's also so annoying
like, the government obviously don't want us to earn money in the charts, right? and the government owns everything
so when you google certain things and they tell you how to trade, they obviously fool you, because they don't want you to learn how to trade, duh
so when you see, do you see all of these people say, that, oh yeah, you have this double bottom
back test that you okay, you see the double bottom, but then you see the move to the downside
i would not be surprised, i would not be surprised about that
but when you look at the charts on trading, it's still, this is the still, it's still the same thing
you use, you use, i mean, actually the same way on forex and on index, just the way i do on on bitcoin
they move a little bit differently, but, you know, you still do the same things
okay, looking at, why do i look at b and b? we're not supposed to look at b b
um, from the last stream that you taught us to back test, use 30, using fib everything seems to click
what is your, uh, what is your bitcoin short term target in the next leg down? um, i think we come back to 25k, i think
but overall target, i do believe 26 500 or potentially 25 400
you know what, guys, i actually need to go my, my ears are killing me
i want to say thank you for everyone that's on this live stream

i'm gonna go now straight and i'm gonna tell them, you better fix my ears now, because i cannot hear anything
my name is josh, and today the s p 500 index officially entered into bear market territory
so i'll be talking more about that later in the video, alongside a brand new bitcoin signal that has only happened just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history
and at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is trading slightly below this range of support coming into play at around 29 to 30 thousand dollars per bitcoin
but considering the fact that we've actually seen a couple daily candle closes slightly below 29 000, and we've still experienced a decent bounce in the short term, which shows us we do have some supports slightly below 29 000 as well
what we need to do is simply readjust this range of support on the charts down to 28 and a half thousands, considering the fact that we've seen a daily kennel close at around 28 and a half thousand, and we still experienced a bounce in the bitcoin price from that level
and so while the bitcoin price is maintaining this range of support, i'd simply expect more sideways, choppy price action
because if we're zooming out to the twoday bitcoin chart, like i said yesterday, we technically have a bullish divergence forming here, with a lower low in the price, but a higher low in the twoday bitcoin rsi
and the last significant bullish divergence we've seen on the twoday bitcoin chart was back during the middle of last year
as this bullish divergence was forming in the middle of last year, even though we saw reduced bearish momentum, like what a bullish divergence suggests, we still experienced a slight downtrend in the bitcoin price, if you're looking at the overall bitcoin price action, but if you're looking at the lows, we didn't really form lower lows this entire time
we saw one lower low as this bullish divergence was forming, but that low was only about a thousand dollars lower than the initial load that we formed back in may
and so simply, based on a number of different factors that i've been talking about recently on the channel, i'm expecting mostly sideways, choppy price action in some sort of price range
but keep in mind, we could still experience a slight lower low, for example, like what we saw in the middle of last year
but basically what i'm saying is i'm not expecting any significant move in the bitcoin price like this or like this anytime soon
but whether you like them or not, price ranges are actually good for bitcoin for two reasons
first of all, generally speaking, they can provide some great accumulation ranges to accumulate some bitcoin
and also, if the bitcoin price is in a very clear range between support and resistance, that is actually a great range to be trading bitcoin
for example, shorting bitcoin at resistance and then longing bitcoin at support
and then that can be another way to accumulate even more bitcoin, or more stable coins, even while the bitcoin price is just chopping around somewhat sideways
but with that being said, i don't recommend leverage trading for complete beginners out there, because trading the swings in the bitcoin price is mainly for those who know how to manage risk and for those who know how the bitcoin price generally moves
and just quickly zooming out to the weekly bitcoin chart to give you a quick update on these moving averages
because right now the bitcoin price is very close to entering back into this price range, which is currently coming in between 281 k and 22k, based on the 1000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average
and in case you are new to this channel, the reason why i'm talking about these two moving averages is, if you simply look at bitcoin's entire price history, pretty much every single time where the bitcoin price enters between these moving averages, that gives us an exceptional buying opportunity, especially if you're holding for the longer term
and this also goes hand in hand with the weekly bitcoin rsi, which is getting very close to oversold territories at the time of recording this video
in fact, right now, the weekly bitcoin rsi is sitting at around 33, and oversold is anything below 30
and what is really interesting is we've only ever seen the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history
and speaking about something that has only happened just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history, taking a look at the monthly bitcoin charts, specifically at the monthly bitcoin rsi, because the level it's sitting at right now has only ever been reached just two other times in bitcoin's entire price history, which were at the end of the 2018 bear market and the end of the 2014 bear market
and you can see that right now, the monthly bitcoin rsi is currently lower than the bottom of the march 2020 crash, which was a massive crash in the bitcoin price
so this right here is actually an extremely rare opportunity that, once again, we've only seen just two other times in bitcoin's 13 years worth of history
so whether or not you think the bitcoin price has already bottomed or it still has lower to go, personally, i am taking advantage of this rare opportunity that we don't see very often by accumulating just some bitcoin by dollar cost averaging as usual
and as i've said time and time again, as the bitcoin price enters into this price range, basically below 28 000 and especially if we get anywhere close to the 200 week moving average at around 22 000, then at those lower prices, personally, i'd simply just buy more bitcoin on top of my regular dollar cost averaging
but something else to think about now is the fact that the s p 500 index, which is here on the weekly time frame, has just officially entered into bear market territory today
because the official definition of a bear market, at least in the stock market, is when the price of securities, so the price of stocks, basically fall by 20 or more from recent highs amid widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment
but technically, the s p 500 index, for example, isn't officially in a bear market until we see a decline of 20 or more, and that's when it becomes an official bear market by definition
and with the red day that we've seen today in the s p 500 index, from the alltime high to the lowest point right now, that's been a decline of nearly 21, which means this is now officially a bear market by definition
and so now that this is the case, what should we expect moving forward? and first of all, it's very obvious that every bear market is going to be different from each other
we're not going to have the exact same bear markets to the last bear market, for example
but simply looking at a few previous spare markers to get some sort of an idea of what could happen, the last bear market that we saw in the s p 500 index happened during the 2020 crash
because that right there was a decline in the s p 500 index of around 35 putting it in bear market territory
and that bear market only lasted for a little over one month, which is actually one of the shortest spare markets we've seen in the stock market in history
but it still brought the weekly rsi down into oversold territories, which was giving us a pretty good buy signal at that stage
because if you're measuring from the high down to the low, that was a decline of a little over 20 percent
so basically as soon as that decline in the s p 500 index became an official bear market by definition, because we just saw the 20 decline, that basically happens at the same time as the s p 500 index actually bottoms out
and if you're looking at the amount of time it took for that bear market to actually play out before we bottomed out in the stock market, that was around 100 days approximately, so pretty much around three months
and once again, at that bear market bottom, we saw the weekly rsi get down towards oversold territories, which also gave us a pretty good buy signal at that stage
but once again, as i said earlier, not every single bear market is going to play out the exact same and what is really interesting about these two previous bear markets we've seen in the s p 500 index is the fact that we also experienced a massive bitcoin crash during march 2020 while the stock market was crashing
and we also obviously experienced a bear market during 2018, in the bitcoin price as well as the stock market
and obviously, the longer term subscribers would already know this, but i've basically been saying this sort of stuff for over a year now on the channel, basically just talking about the correlation between the stock market and the bitcoin price
because, in case you don't already know, yes, the stock market and the bitcoin price are correlated, at least most of the time
so basically we need to see some sort of bottom form in the stock market and a decent bounce back towards the upside before expecting more bullish price action, i mean, a lot more bullish price action in the bitcoin price
otherwise we shouldn't really be expecting a lot of bullish price action in the bitcoin price while the stock market is still playing out a bear market
but whether or not prices are going up or down, there's still ways to make money in crypto, like trading or owning interest
and if you want to know exactly how to do that, then these two videos popping up right here on your screen are definitely for you to watch
because i've got a trading tutorial video in the top left and a passive income video in the bottom left
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
it's matt, and i'm here to bring you the latest and greatest technical bitcoin update
so we're gonna analyze the market structure and what you should expect for the remainder of this week
and so as a quick reminder, if at any point in time, you end up finding this video helpful, then make sure to drop a like and subscribe if you're not yet subscribed

i provided a link down in the description of this video as well
and if you'd like additional trading guidance, woman, there's a separate link
so if we take a look on the four hour time frame, then the price action basically has done nothing special over the last week, where we have simply continued ranging and moving sideways
so whenever the market structure on a higher time frame, depending on the type of trader that you are, whenever it's ranging, sometimes it's beneficial to drop down to a lower time frame and to trade the price action if you're looking for momentum
otherwise, there's nothing better to do beyond that point but to wait
and so if you didn't want to wait, at the very least, as i discussed, on a lower time frame, maybe on the 15 minute or in the five minute you could look for some scalps or some short term opportunities
but of course, this depends on the type of trader that you are
so personally, what i'm still waiting for is for the price action to push outside of the range, ideally above it to to sweep the high that we had back on may 14th
so currently the price action is consolidating pretty tightly on the one hour
and as far as the range goes, there's technically multiple correct answers where you could look at the range as being all the way up from this point of resistance down to this low that i marked out, or you could just mark out the lows that are at around 288 000
now, as far as, uh, the midpoint of this range goes, as long as we hold up above the midpoint of this range
so if i narrow this down, and let's drop down to the one hour, the midpoint here would be priced at around this region that previously acted as resistance
actually slightly above that, this level could potentially act as support
and that would also represent a small sweep below these recent lows that occurred just a couple of hours ago
so if we do push down, which i think is pretty likely that we can, um so as long as we hold up above the midpoint, uh, regardless of if we sweep these lows, as i discussed, what i'm looking for is for the price action to then push above the high that we had on may 15th
now this high did act as a previous liquidity grab, where we spiked above the high that was back here on may 13th
but due to the fact that the price action had so much time to push down, and we just continually kept holding up above the this region of 29 000 or 287 000, which would represent this hourly support region, i'm leaning more towards the fact that we're going to push above this height
and what's above this high? well, that's where, if we look to the left, let me actually go on to the 15 minutes so this can be a bit more accurate
this liquidity grab, right above this high, to the left is where we have a price and balance
so this price point, uh, that's at around, let's just round it to 316 thousand dollars
that's an area that is basically above the high that i was discussing here
so if we sweep above this high, above this high, i would be looking for a tap of this price and balance
you could either wait for another rejection off of the midpoint of this range
so as i discussed, if we push down a few hundred dollars to around 297 thousand dollars, you can look to go along from there, and then you can target the price and balance
and if not there, then where's the next region that we're going to push into? well, if we now zoom out on the daily chart, we can see how overextended we are, just basically looking at this drop that we had over the past two weeks or so
and typically when this happens, this means that we're going to regress back into the mean, or at least are much more likely to, in order to gather up more liquidity if we're going to continue pushing down, which does make sense, because we felt so drastically
and so we have to think about the fact that there's a ton of sellers still holding on to bitcoin from last week
and so their their levels could be targeted for the liquidity that's needed in order to continue pushing the price action lower
and we can see the last weekly candle never, despite sleep uh, sweeping below the lows that we had during the middle uh of 2021, despite sweeping below these lows and pushing to 255 thousand dollars, and never closed, uh, below this month, monthly range
and now this current weekly candle, although it has technically pushed down, as i discussed, we have been rejecting this support zone
so this range is pretty significant, because, as i discussed, as long as we hold up inside of it and we break into the upside, we're going to continue pushing higher, which is what i'm leaning more towards from a probable standpoint
and even the last daily candle closed bullish, despite the one from two days ago closing bearish
so we had that initial bearish push, it never closed below, uh, this range
so this is why i'm looking for the price action to continue pushing higher
so as i discuss this price and balance is at around 316 thousand dollars
and even above this price and balance, if we think about the fact that bitcoin can probably push much higher than that
so it's not just going to push a couple hundred dollar dollars at that point
what i would be looking for is for the next major price and balance
so on the four hour here, if we take a look at this last drop that we had, or the last bearish impulsive move
so if i connect from the high that we had on may 4th all the way down to the most recent lowest low, i did briefly discuss this in the last update, but just a quick reminder, the major price imbalance that is residing for bitcoin would be at around 377 or 38 000
now, of course, the likelihood that we correct back up into into here right away is pretty low, in my opinion
so just because we do need to correct and gather up liquidity if we are looking to push lower, that doesn't necessarily mean it has to correct all the way up into here
and so if we skip that point, which is so far away, if we just look at the next region, the next level that would be residing for bitcoin would be at the next minor price and balance, and that's up here, above the highs that we had on may 10th
so typically, whenever you have price imbalances that are looking to be sweeped, they'll typically be above any significant highs or below any significant lows
so in this case, above these highs where we were consolidating during may 10th and may 11th
this is a region where we likely have a small price and balance
and if we think about this roughly, this would represent a measured move of this range
it's not quite a measured move, uh, depends how you connect it
but this region of 327 000 is another area where you could look to take profit
the first one could be, uh, the price and balance where i discussed, 316 000
and so just to quickly wrap this up, i'm waiting for a push outside of this hourly range in order for us to continue pushing higher
and the last scenario, of course, is let's say i'm entirely wrong and we do reject this range and we push below these lows
at that point, i'm just gonna wait and see what the price action does
but then this can simply represent the last bear trap before we finally continue pushing back up over the next upcoming day
so so this could, although, although it's not a guarantee this can happen, this could be the last ditch effort, at least, as i discussed, for the next couple of days
this isn't permanent, but um, this would trap any sellers looking to quickly dive into bitcoin before we push up a couple thousand dollars to fill these price and balances to the left, and in order to gather up any more liquidity, for bitcoin to continue pushing lower within this daily bearish trend
so the momentum is strong, but you do have waves in the market, and so we're due for a larger correction
so if we honestly look at the past two months, it's almost been two months
so based on probability alone, this weekly candle, which still has about, um, three days left to close, is likely going to close bullish

she's going to go to the higher time frames, lower time frames
it's really warm here where i live, so it's absolutely fantastic
all right, natalie, well, let's just get straight into the content
and, yeah, if you can share the screen, tell us what do you see using your information, what you know? i know you are a fibonacci expert
you always use fibonacci, which i also use it sometimes, and it's absolutely a fantastic tool
i first of all want to show you that i am in a long position right now on by bit
i bought the market at 29 000, around that level, and we're about to reach my target at thirty thousand and one hundred
and i actually have a settlement order at that at the exact level where i do have my take profit
but first of all, i want to show you on the three monthly chart
i've been talking about this on my community also, every single day
i keep reminding everyone about how important the three monthly chart is
so as you guys know, i use the fibonacci and the first thing that i'm gonna do is that i drag it from the last low that we do have, around 6115, back to the high at 58 370
because you can see that this was the high high bitcoin created
and at the moment, we need to come back down to create a higher low
and this is what a lot of people get confused, is that when they see this huge movement now to the downside, i know a lot of people freak out
but when it comes to how the market is moving, when you create a high, the market needs to come back down to create a highly low for then create another higher high
we just might also, obviously, see the market continue back down
but as long as we are inside these two fibonacci levels, i still wait for the market to reverse, uh, back up
so this is why the three multi chart is really important, uh, for me at least
so we go down to the lower time frames and just try to understand exactly, uh, what happens
and by just back testing, usually what happens is that the market feels this week
and we have, we've been talking about this, uh before with our, uh, previous couple of collaborations and our live streams
and so first of all, i don't do so much right now at the weekly the only thing that i recognize is that i do believe that we will come back down to this level
and that is, and the level is at 25 300, and that is slightly above the 618 percent
and then we go down to the lower time frames just to try to understand what we'll look at
what i also did was that i used this previous support, i just dragged it and i took the box from the the close of last week
and that is also combined with this low go down to the daily charts
and we we don't see so much right here how to use another fibonacci
so that's when i go to the to the fourth hourly chart, because you can see more clear where the lower lows and lower high is
so what i did was that i took the fibonacci from this last small lower high, from 34 770, back to the end, to the low of this week that i do believe bitcoin will come back down to, uh, 25 272
and that is also combined, the 618 is combined with the support that we did break
and if we zoom in, you could also see how we saw the market came back up and retested this level, and saw the market come back down a little bit
this is where the most important thing is, for me at least, because when we see the market in a downtrend like this, this is the pullback
so a lot of people can can be confused when they see the pullback, and they think like, oh, yeah, the market is going up right now
and then from nowhere, you see the market break down and continue to the downside
what they don't understand is that we are below the support, uh, the previous support, turn it into a resistance
and we are the what happened was that we broke the higher low, the last higher low
in this case, what we see right now, as i told you, this is the pullback
so when we so as long as we're creating higher lows, we are still in the option, because it's the higher lows that maintain the uptrend
and based on that, we understand that we can't, or at least that that's how i saw it
combined with the support, i understood that from these levels we could see the break to the downside
and what i expect the market is come back down the next impulsive move, back down to 25 300
so i took the other fibonacci from the last high, yeah, to the low, because we broke structure when we broke the previous higher low, created a lower low
and now we see the market pull back up to the fibonacci levels at thirty thousand and thirty thousand and three hundred
but this is where i see the market pull back up to to then reverse back down
but when when i bought the market right here, i only bought the market because this was the pullback
so what i did was that i went down to the lower time frames we saw the brick of structure
but because i know how market structure, uh is working, i took another uh trend line
because as long as we're below this trend line, still creating lower lows and lower highs, what happens right here? we broke structure, because we we try
okay, it doesn't look that good, but we broke the previous lower, lower high, created a higher high
so this is what i did then, because now i know around these levels, i expect the market to pull back upright to create the lower high
now, when we saw the break of the resistance trend line, i took another flip from six hundred 28 fifty to the higher high to at twenty nine thousand two hundred and ninety four, market came back down
i bought the market right here because i saw the market push back up to these levels
so that, that is why i, i bought the market at this level, i have to take profit where i also have my sell limit order, where i do expect the market then to reverse back down
i was just seeing, you know, um, you know, you actually getting into those, you know, looking at the longer time frame frame, getting into, you know, that potential short now, getting into that long from this pullback, you know, because we're getting bouncing back up
using the fibonacci um extension as in where the price target could go
i can see this 075 point 12 as the extension where it could actually stop, and then hitting the 618 again from the actual drop to continue the downtrend
i mean, this is how you, you know, you just need to zoom out and on each time frame, and going from swing trading to day trading to scalping, exactly
and this is why, this is why i love the fibonacci, and this is why i will never stop talking about fibonacci, because the fibonacci respects each other's fibonaccis on every timeframe
so what i do is that i just try to combine the higher time frames with the lower time frames and try to understand market structure on the heights time frames
and okay, so if the market is in a downtrend on the four hourly, on the one hour we just might see the pullback
so what do i do that? so the good thing when we understand how to use the fibonacci with trend lines, etc, you could just puzzle everything together
when when i realized, especially when i started to use the trend line combined with the fibonacci, you see the break of structure
you use the fibonacci because fibonacci is where you see the pullback, yeah, the higher low or the lower high
so at the moment, i'm just waiting for, i just wait for, uh, to bitcoin to pull back up to i i do have my take profit at thirty thousand one hundred
uh, so it's, it's between the fifteen sixty one percent at twenty nine thousand and nine hundred and seventy and, uh, thirty thousand two hundred and eighty
and from these levels, if i just gonna clean, uh, clean up the charts, what what i will do at that point? i'm just gonna take that back
so because we know that in the option, the higher low is maintaining the higher lows, right? so if i see another pullback to the downside, and we're still above the support trend line, we can still push back up
but then when we come back up to the fibonacci levels where i do expect the market to reverse back down from, we will see the market break the support trendline, break the higher low, create a lower low
i use another fibonacci at that point to figure out where is the next lower high
i drag it from the last high to the new lower low, and fibonacci will calculate where that lower high can be
or obviously we need to look at candlesticks, how it looks, etc
but that is usually what happens, is that the market just break down from that level
so it is the same thing when it comes to when i bought the market, we saw the break of the resistance trend line, i used the fibonacci
vpvr, but it's just because i'm used to it and i really like it
but definitely, you know, this is the the key, this is the actual, the key thing for for actually analysis
you know, market structure, fibonacci, which is absolutely amazing
sometimes it works like clockwork, because it goes to the 50 or the 618
and also those extensions also 0 23 hits, you know, almost 100 of the times, of course
so you do think that we are going to come down to about 25 000 in the next few days, maybe one week or so, after this kind of, um, pullback that we are having right now? yeah, yeah, exactly
so if we look at the higher, higher perspective um, after this huge drop that we did, i'm just going to take everything away
after this huge drop that we've been that we've had to the downside if if we would see the market from nowhere, um, having a momentum to the upside
and looking at overall, i do believe that we will come back down
and, but i i think that we will, uh, consolidate in between the, uh, 25k and potentially 32 000 or 33 000
and before we break to the upside, because i definitely believe that bitcoin will create another high, uh, alltime high
not now, but i definitely believe that we are in a super great level where we can expect the market in a couple of weeks, maybe a month or so
but slowly and steady, i do believe that we will break to the upside
but, uh, one thing that i think a lot of people need to have in mind is that when we are inside such a huge fibonacci it usually market is using this as a support and resistance zone
because, you, you just might see the market, break the the support, you come back up, and we try to break the resistance, then we come back down to the support again
and then you see this huge momentum to, uh, to the upside, and everyone's like, what's happening? yeah, we were just inside the consolidation market, and we were just prepared to see the movement stood outside
uh, so you do think that, you know, bitcoin is not going to go to 18 000 or 10 000? even some people are saying that bitcoin could potentially go i i personally don't think we're gonna go that low
we'll be staying above 20 000 for a potential bottom, i think, in the next few months
anything else else you want to say to the community guys? natalie's channel will be down below
natalie, anything to say to my community? yeah, um, welcome to my channel
and i have morning live streams every single day, monday to friday, 8 am, swedish time, so one hour before london session, because i just want to go through with everyone before the whole day starts, before the market starts to be very volatile
it's very, it's very good to look at the charts before everything starts, so we know during the day what levels we're reaching our winning downtrend
where can the lower, higher, high, low be? so every single morning, monday to friday, i have the morning live streams
in this episode we are taking a look at the bitcoin price on the one hourly
we talked about this ascending channel that we did have for bitcoin breaking down, this area getting a consolidation
now the probabilities, of course, and going to lower levels is higher
but i'm going to show you what major levels we can see as support for a potential bounce
and i'm going to tell you why gmt is very likely going to hit the one dollar area in the next coming days
make sure to smash up the like button, because we're not going to take a look at the weekly chart
if you haven't checked it out, make sure to check out yesterday's video with the weekly scenario
okay, why i do think that we're not going to break successfully below 25 000
okay, looking at the weekly, but zooming in here on the one hourly
we talked about this scenario over here, where we potentially gonna break down this major support from this ascending channel
okay? we haven't done it with too much volume, but volume can start kicking right now
we are actually at the lowest value area, low, as you can see
so we do need that push down, all right, on the bitcoin price right now, because we basically not pushing down with volume
and what i want to show you in today's episode is, what levels could we bounce from? because i think it is very, very likely that bitcoin, you know, will be hitting, you know, twenty eight thousand dollars, maybe even twenty seven thousand dollars
but i am looking from this, from this exact area of potential balance where i actually think that bitcoin could bounce to the upside from this level
but a little bit of done more downside is very, very possible
and i am looking for that potential bounce where, at what exact levels are you looking for that balance? well, just keeping it simple in a nutshell, okay? fibonacci retracement from the low to the highs over here, you know, in between, already the 382 to the 618 area, all right, which would be the 275 k level where we could potentially get that bounce on bitcoin
in my personal opinion, it is also a major level on the four hourly
it is a four hourly close right over here, where we could get a little bit of volatility, you know, and hit that level and get supported exactly at that six one eight level
and if we take a look at the one hourly chart, okay, let me just go to the one hourly chart here for this, you know, quick major level
i want to show you, you know, the biggest volumes that we've had, okay, for the last 10 days is on the 11th of may and on the 12th of may, where we actually got that big, massive bounce, all right, once we hit that 253 range low
remember, on the 12th of may, we exactly, you know, got that big, massive bounce here with some pretty nice volume on the one hourly
so this the top of this one hourly candle with this big volume, is exactly also the closes at around about the 275, 276, okay, where we should be getting some kind of reaction at that level
this is why i do think that we could actually get a bounce from those levels
remember we were talking about this inverse, head and shoulder
okay? it's not the most beautiful, all right, because this is a bit of an aggressive descending neckline, but we actually getting a bounce, okay? already from this neckline
we've had a bounce here to the 6182 perfection from this drop
now, like i said, when you break a trend line, you are probably going to retest it
you could actually retest it for a few times and then get the bounce
i am expecting lower levels, but i am also expecting a potential big bounce in between that, 27, 28 000
we might have a little bit of volatility, a little bit of a few weeks
all right? but i think it's very likely we're going to create a higher low from this region
if we do successfully create that higher low, round at the level, okay? well above 26 thousand dollars
i am eyeing, okay, a potential harmonic pattern that i will be talking about once we create that higher low and that big consolidation and a potential balance, where i do think we'll be breaking well above 32 000 in the next coming weeks, if we do manage to create that higher low
we'll be eyeing that in the next few days, if we do manage to create that higher low
and what i want to tell you, to tell you is that that harmonic is valid if we do actually start pumping to the upside from this exact moment, because we are already hitting an important fibonacci harmonic level, which is the 382
okay? so we are actually at that 382, from the low of 253 to the high of just 314, here, hitting that 382, which is very much valid
okay, for that nice price action to the upside in the coming weeks

all right, i will be leaving this link for this page down below to see if you are eligible
so let's dive in here into gmt, guys, because gmt is looking very good now for a major drop
since we broke this kind of ascending symmetrical triangle, i would say, okay, i am eyeing this bullish gauntlet pattern that could turn into a bullish bat pattern
but let's just zoom out here and see where we are here on the four hourly with gmt token
because, you know, i did very, made very successful trades on gmt for the last few weeks
and since we broke this major trend line here from march, as you can see right over there, we've been in a big, massive downtrend
and, you know, each support and resistance zones has been turning, you know, having has been getting that rejection to perfection
okay? as you can see, we did have this major support created from april, bouncing at that two dollar range
as soon as we broke it, successful resistance, turning, you know, and having that major drop
and also, we did have a support bounce right over here on march, as you can see, and also one over here in may, the 9th of may, getting that bounce from that 175 cents
now, what has happened here in the immediate short term, because the trend is to the downside, we are hitting major resistance here at the 175, as you can see, just in the last few days
so it's very, very likely going to get rejected and continue to the downside
so if we just zoom in to see what has happened in this price action, as soon as we got rejected from that 175, we have had a kind of symmetrical triangle, right where we have had these lower highs, as you can see, higher lows, and the price of btc actually breaking down
we are actually at below the biggest point of control here on gmt, which is at the 150, from the last 10 days
now, what we can expect here is that we are actually going to come all the way down here to almost retest the lows, or even potentially retested it
but what i want to show you here, of course, you know this kind of a symmetrical triangle
and this textbook target, okay? is getting the width of this symmetrical triangle from the breakout
it is showing you that we can actually hit that one dollar range
but we've also got a gartly pattern, okay, which is taking the low here, right over here, to this high, to this 50 retracement to the next lower high over here, which is the point 88
all right? from this actual drop, you're hitting the 088, creating that lower high to have that potential gatling pattern where you are going to very likely lose these lows at the 120 level
this would be the gartley pattern where you could potentially get a bounce here at around about that one dollar area
it is the target of this symmetrical triangle that we have broken down from, and very likely that we are going to hit, you know, the point 79 78, which is the gartley, okay? um, d point where you could get a potential big bounce
it would be also the value area low, which would be round about the 90 cent
and what i want to show you that a gartly pattern can turn into a bat pattern
and what could happen here is that, instead of hitting the point 78 and getting the bounce, you could actually hit the point 88, which would be that crab pattern, all right, which would be hitting the value area low here, as you can see from this volume traded range, and potentially getting that balance
okay, so i am looking to target that one dollar, 90 cent level, all right, on gmt, where you could create that higher low and get a big, big bounce

check out the bitcoin sensors website for the latest news, technical analysis, ideas, totally free information down below
my name is josh, and right now the bitcoin price is forming a brand new pattern that we need to be paying attention to
first of all, giving you a quick update on the daily bitcoin chart
and obviously, the bitcoin price is still trading around that range of support coming into play at around 29 to 30 000 per bitcoin
and technically, over the past one day, we did see a daily candle close slightly below 29 000
but obviously today the bitcoin price has bounced straight back into that range of support
and that's why i mentioned in one of my last bitcoin update videos that ideally we need to see a weekly candle close below 29 000 in order to further confirm a break below otherwise, what we've seen just here, with a daily candle close slightly below 29 000, just isn't enough confirmation of a further break to the downside
so once again, as of right now, this is still the range of support to keep an eye on
but if you're zooming out to the twoday bitcoin charts, we are currently forming a bullish divergence between the january low and the most recent low
and this is also visible on the daily time frame and obviously on the twoday time frame
but it disappears once you zoom out to the threeday time frame and any further than that
but obviously, you can clearly see that the bitcoin price has made lower lows, while the rsi has actually made higher lows between january and right now
and the last time we got a significant bullish divergence, a multimonth bullish divergence, that was visible on the twoday time frame, was back during the middle of last year, during june and july
once again, if you're looking at the bitcoin price during that time period, we clearly formed lower lows, while the rsi, on the other hand, formed higher lows
so this is basically a sign on the chart telling us that the bearish momentum is slowing down
and so the most likely outcome from a bullish divergence is either mostly sideways price action, or some slightly bullish price action
now obviously, we can have a much more bullish scenario, like, for example, the end of july, we absolutely exploded to the upside in the bitcoin price
but to see something that bullish, would really need to see the stock market start pumping back up
so for the most part, when you're talking about the next few weeks, maybe even the next couple months, like what we saw back in the middle of last year, and also like what we saw in the first quarter of this year, i would mostly be expecting some sort of price range for bitcoin, not necessarily an overly bearish or overly bullish trend, but instead a price range where the bitcoin price basically just chops around, whether that's slightly bearish or slightly bullish
but i would not be expecting any major crash like this, or any major pump like this over the next few weeks or so
now keep in mind, this is a larger time frame, so these sort of moves, these fluctuations in the bitcoin price within these sort of price ranges, even though they might not look that big, at least compared to these much larger moves in the markets, we still end up seeing some decent sized swings within these price ranges
for example, during the middle of last year, even though we're in a somewhat sideways price range, the bitcoin price still had 20 swings
and the same could be said about the price range that bitcoin was in in the first quarter of this year
so when you're zooming into the shorter term like the hour charts, for example, then these swings in the bitcoin price actually look a lot bigger
and so that's just something to keep in mind when i say that we could be due for some sideways price action, relatively speaking, on the larger time frames
once again, on the smaller time frames, they could still look like significant moves in the bitcoin price
and right now we are really close to that massive accumulation range in between 28 000 and 22 000, which is provided by these two moving averages, which are the 1 000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average
and as the subscribers would already know by now, pretty much every single time where the bitcoin price enters between these two moving averages, we end up seeing a generational buying opportunity, basically the best buying opportunity you could possibly get, according to bitcoin's entire price history, around these moving averages
and this can also be paired with a weekly bitcoin rsi, because this gives us buy signals of similar significance pretty much any time where the weekly bitcoin rsi enters into oversold territories
and if you're looking at where it is right now, we're getting very close to oversold territories, but we're not there just yet
but what has been confirmed on the weekly bitcoin chart is the massive spike we've seen in the weekly bitcoin volume
now i won't be going into the details of this chart in this video because i've been talking about it quite a lot recently on the channel
so if you want a more detailed explanation of these charts right here, definitely check out my last bitcoin update video that i posted yesterday on the channel
and something else that i talked more about in yesterday's bitcoin update video was this monthly bitcoin chart, looking specifically at the monthly bitcoin macd
and just quickly summarizing what i said about this chart in yesterday's bitcoin update video, basically, if you look at the last two significant bitcoin bear markets, which were the 2014 bear market and the 2018 bear markets, roughly around halfway through each bear market, we saw a bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd, which is represented by the white vertical line
and then pretty much exactly five months after we saw that bearish cross in this indicator, on this time frame, we bottomed out for the bitcoin bear market
in 2014 and in 2018, once again, five months after the bearish cost in the monthly bitcoin macd
and if you're looking at the monthly bitcoin macd in the present day, we saw a bearish cross in this indicator on this time frame back in january
so next month for a possible bear market bottom, according to these two previous significant bear markets
stock market today, this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily timeframe
and today we haven't really seen a lot of action in the nasdaq 100 index
but what would be important for the nasdaq is to try and hold above that previous load that we set last week at around 117 k approximately
because obviously, if the nasdaq 100 index can form a higher low, especially going into the weekly candle close, then that would be a good sign to see going into next week
but the moment we break that previous low, then that will just show us that we're still seeing a lot of bearish momentum in the stock market, which is obviously not good for crypto because, as i always say, crypto prices and the stock markets are correlated a lot of the time
it doesn't really matter, because we can actually make money either way
and if you want to know how to do that, check out one of these uploads popping up right here on your screen
because in both of these videos, i reveal how i continue to make money in crypto no matter what prices are doing
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so the bitcoin price is currently fighting and bouncing around that 30 000 level
uh? so we're gonna have a look at a couple of different charts today to kind of get a perspective of where we are in this current market
the first chart that i have up here is the dixie, which is the dollar index
so if you follow my twitter, you'll remember that i mentioned to you that if we take out that weak low of the previous week, there could be a slight chance of a reversal on the dixie
however, it would most likely just be a shorter move for crypto
and the reason being is because we're still overall, in a downtrend on all time frames that matter
so this doesn't really give me too much information until this week ends
if we start to close a weekly candle underneath that line, which is at 10337, then i would start to target lower prices
then i would say, well, most likely, the following week, is going to sell off
so to give you some perspective from current levels, that could be around a, let's round it up and call it a two percent down move for the dixie
and a two percent down move for the dixie could translate to anywhere from a 10 to a 20 move within relative cryptos
so not too much to say about this, other than that yellow box was our accumulation zone
so i was about 20 percent entered by the bottom of this candle, and i took my profits
again, if you follow me on twitter, that is where i do give my live updates on anything that i'm changing, or any sort of trade decisions that i've made
so coming up towards the top of this, we are meeting areas of resistance
and you'll be able to see that on some of the other charts when i go into a lower time frame
all right, bringing up the quarterly level chart with the on a weekly and it's got our macd
you can see the macd is still building up momentum to the downside
so we want to see this histogram start to change, where you start to get the lighter bars and it to start pushing back up
and then that would maybe be a signal that this bounce could be turning into an actual reversal
so we have we wick through, then the next week we've wicked off of that level
and if you start to see a weekly candle come below that horizontal then you're going to have to start targeting lower prices, right? so we have to face reality, and the reality is that there isn't really any support underneath that level
so if we start to lose the 28 900 level, the realistic next target is going to be around 21 000 as my main zone
but from a horizontal perspective, you are looking at about 19 000
if it does lose that, bear in mind that your next key important level is going to be 11 800
so again, i'm not saying that this is going to happen yet, but this is something that you need to be cognizant of and pay attention to
you'll also notice the red weekly candles that everyone's spoken of
you've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and we on eight
so what you can use for that is, it's called the td sequential by a guy named tom the mark, a very, very good trader
and generally what happens is markets tend to reverse on the nine
okay? so whether that be to the upside or the downside, it it just gauges momentum
so it's not always going to happen like that, but it is something that i'm watching and i'm cognizant of
if we do lose this horizontal level, uh, then i would expect that you probably are going to get the seven, the eight and the nine, which is going to come down towards those low 20s
you do know that i have taken longs here and there, but the risk still remains to the downside
and that's still coming in at that same level, at about 23 000
so that's going to be really where you want to save your money for
okay? if you're a longterm investor and you're looking to buy the dip, that's where you want to buy the dip
but since this this new weekly candle has already come down, if it doesn't start moving up very, very quickly, then that's probably not going to be the case
you can see that you got all your i want to just turn off the drawing, so it clears it up a little bit
you got your emas, which is your 21, your 50 and your 200 ema
you can see that price tried to get back above the 21, and it hit the 50, rejected off of that
now this is classic of what you would see as a rejection and trend continuation
so you've rejected off that level, and now you're struggling to get back above the 21 ema
i actually saw the majority of my lungs when we were near this level over here, and i was in different alt coins
and then if you were on my twitter, you'll say that, you'll see that i mentioned over there, i said, very frustrating
level is going to be between this 30 000 level is going to be your range
so we deviated, came back down, try to push back up, rejected off the 50, came back below the range low
so the next level to target is going to be, i assume a lot of people would load up on shorts just underneath the zone
you also lost your diagonal trend over there, so they're going to be targeting that 29 277 level
now you could wick into that and bounce off, but it depends on the momentum
if the momentum is strong in the bears favor, then i would be ultimately targeting this gray area box, which is ranging between 22 and 23 000
and that's where i mentioned those are going to be the main dip buying areas that i'm looking at
so there's not much else to say other than we caught in a range
you want confirmation of which way this is going to go, then you're going to be looking for a break of the range
and you can probably confirm that you breaking the range to the downside
so this horizontal is going to be the bottom part of the range, top part of the range
i'm looking at getting firstly above 30 000 over here, and then ultimately above the green box, which is at 31 500
you clear that, and then you can start to take long so in summary, kind of in a no trade zone, like really, you just got to wait
once we start to clear those ranges, uh, we'll have more information
make sure that you hit the like subscribe button below, hit the bell notification as well
then anytime i go live, you'll basically be able to get notified of that
there will be a card that's going to pop up as soon as this video is finished
for now, you, unless you've been living under a rock, you'll realize that the us
dollar has rallied to its highest level since 2020, and that is voting pretty poorly for risk assets
this level over here, from back in 2002 and 2003, is quite a significant level, in my opinion
wants to go down onto the lower time frames on the dollar index
and that is helping bitcoin be supported at current levels around thirty thousand dollars
and we can see some continued support in risk assets like equities, like crypto, leading into the june fomc meeting, which will be the next key macro event for the markets to digest
so if we draw from the low of july 2002 across, i think that is the key pivot for the us
you can expect that level to act as resistance while we're below, and then act as support while we're above
and if i zoom into the lower time frames, or the three day now, you can see that we're starting to push below that level
but us dollar weakness means that bitcoin can move higher, as well as the rest of the crypto market and equities as well
dollar moves lower, and the opposite is true for when it moves higher
so what does this all mean? i'm down on the four hour chart on the us
and as long as we continue to see rallies into this 104, roughly 104 level, we should see bitcoin supported
so any moves like this from now on in, should see further highs or further support for bitcoin
dollar gain some strength again and move towards the highs, we'll see bitcoin fall back to the low
looking at the economic calendars to see if there's any catalysts for the us
dollar index to move higher or lower, there's not a whole heap at the moment
but of course, there's always the unscheduled events that can cause the most damage
and that will be very, very important for the markets to digest
it can shock the market into further aggressive hawkish pricing
and the other way if there's a bit of dovishness and the fed are kind of being more accommodative in those minutes, we can see the opposite effect, where the market moves higher and risk appetite starts to grow
we also have preliminary gdp data on the 26th, and then into the 27th, we have the core pce inflation data
so that would be a key metric to watch as far as how inflation is evolving
and of course, that is a key metric for the fed to decide what they're going to do with their monetary policy into the coming months
so this week, not so much on the economic front, but next week there will be a lot of noise, i guess, for the us
dollar to digest, and therefore bitcoin and equities will also have to digest that news
help you visualize this correlation between the dollar index, us equities and bitcoin
tech index that includes apple, that includes netflix and companies like that
dollar index, you can see how highly correlated these three assets are
so there is a very, very strong correlation between all of these assets and how they move together
dollar hitting resistance on a macro level, like we spoke about earlier, at about 104, and how price action develops
now, around that level, falling back into the range, would mean that bitcoin and equity start to see some support and a leg higher
dollar starts to be supported above that resistance and moves higher, we really could see bitcoin and us
but the key for now is to monitor the data and monitor how those macro events that i've pointed out play out over the coming weeks
for that meeting, currently the market is pricing in a 50 basis point hike, which has been openly communicated by jerome powell, the head of the federal reserve
and that is being priced in with a 93 probability for the june meeting
and the market is even erring on the higher side of a 50 basis point hike, being a 75 basis point hike with a seven percent chance of happening
these probabilities will likely shift depending on how that data comes out and what the feds say between now and then
so continually watching that and watching how that evolves will also impact how the us
dollar is priced, how equities move off the back of that, and how bitcoin moves in relation to equities
so i would expect that there's a 50 basis point hike in june, and that would be a sell the rumor for now and buy the news into the event, like we've seen so far for the last six months leading into the fed meetings
but of course, those meeting minutes for next week are very very critical
and the contents of those meeting minutes will have a great deciding factor in how bitcoin, how the us
if you did, leave a like on the video and subscribe to the channel
i am very excited to talk about bitcoin because we are actually dumping
i actually preferred the price of bitcoin dropping from this support line and going to lower levels for the next 24 hours
i would have preferred this right now than actually coming back up here
because this means, you know, we have got a chance and to have a pretty nice impulse from these levels, this major support level that i've been talking in today's video
okay, so this is what we're going to talk about in today's live stream right now
you know, the one of the reasons why also bitcoin is actually having that drop is because of, you know, dxy actually pumping, gaining value
we can talk about oil, because i am actually trading oil at this moment
i pretty much knew that this was a fake out from, you know, that i've been trading oil last week, made a very successful trade, and i'm actually in another short position on oil, that we also can explain, guys
there was a beautiful harmonic pattern here on oil that i actually shorted all the way down here to the 100 range
and i pretty much, you know, looking at the analysis here, that this was a fake breakout from this resistance of this ascending channel on oil
i know i want to read what most of the comments, take a look at a bunch of cryptos
but i want to show you guys what i see on the charts, what i am trading, what i can see, not just look at your cryptocurrency and your opinion
i want to give you my opinion, and then we can read all through your opinions
kyber network, we were talked about, of we talked about knc in today's episode
what was happening with knc? we had this big, massive resistance at the 240 range
we went to the value area high here, looking at the vpvr from the volume traded during the last, you know, in june, 2021 and 2022
as soon as i, we were trading at 240 as soon as i made the video, i actually shorted this on by bit
now, what is going to happen? you know, i am protected already
and, you know, just in case, what happens if we do have a successful breakout to the upside, you know, i rather get stopped out at break even and see how we are going to react at that level again
because if we do get rejected and get a few weeks time to enter, a lot of people, a lot of traders, you know, enter something because they think they're gonna miss out
i don't think we're going to go as high as my entry here, just slightly below 2 30 cents
let's see what happens if i get stopped out of breakeven, then, yeah, there might be another opportunity
we might get volatility at that 240 range again for another short opportunity, for a double top, and then short back again
and also on primex bt, you get seven percent added to your deposit, and you can trade oil, natural gas, s p 500, using crypto as calero collateral, and also stable coins as collateral
i love this, because i am now eyeing crude oil and natural gas
and i think, you know, a lot of people think that oil and natural gas is going to go to much higher levels
all right, a lot of people think, because of the current situation, worldwide situation, war, that oil prices and natural gas is going to go to much higher levels
they have already pumped a huge amount the last, you know, month
so this is the thing, i think we are ready to correct too much lower levels the coming weeks on natural gas and oil
because the reason i am doing live streams is to connect with you guys
i give you my opinion, i give you my live streams, i give you my daily updates
moderators, always giving power here to the community, to the live streams
said, says, one of my strongest moderators here saying, you know, he's disappointed
um, i'm disappointed because you gave my third like, it doesn't matter
i mean, i try and keep it simple, looking at a few different indicators, but, you know the deal
try and keep it straight to the point here for the community, all our crypto legend says, mark dutch, how are you doing, david? hello
how low can bitcoin go? we do have some, you we do have several theories, all right, from people out there
you know, that this is, uh, a brilliant example as the dotcom bubble, you know, put in the dotcom bubble, you know, in the year 2000, i was 10
and basically there was, you know, the dotcom bubble was when internet was, you know, exploding
there was pure speculation in that where internet was going to be the future
we've got internet, we got youtube, we've got facebook, we've got dot coms everywhere
20 years later, here we are, you know, living off internet and using internet for almost everything
so what they are comparing right now is with cryptocurrency, is that this is just a huge, massive bubble, and that, you know, there's not real use just yet
and that we are potentially going to go to much lower levels with bitcoin
and a lot of the altcoins are going to, you know, lose all coins have already, a lot of them have lost more than 80, even 90, and we could go even lower
so, you know, a lot of speculation out there that bitcoin could come down as low as ten thousand dollars
and if you guys follow me, you must follow some other people, you know, ten thousand dollars, if you take a look at the volume profile, you know, from the last four to five years, the high value the the value area high, okay? is right over here at twelve thousand dollars
so, you know it, there's been more volume traded in between 2018 till late 2020 than actually in the last two years
so, you know, who knows? it would definitely be an ultimate bottom, uh, down at, you know, ten thousand dollars
i'm gonna buy a lot of bitcoin at those levels, no doubt about that
i know a lot of people are gonna buy bitcoin at, um, at those levels
let me ask a question here to the community before i read the rest of the comments, then we can do some analysis
but it's just so much information that i want to ask you guys, do you think bitcoin can reach 10k? can it reach 10 000? let me know, guys in the comment section, because there is a lot of speculation now that this is the massive, big bubble, and crypto is going to absolutely crash 2022, 2023, and then potentially enter a bull run, right? and late 2023, 2024
can reach 10k? do you think bitcoin can reach 10 000, you know, in this bear market? uh, let me know guys right away
no, where is my, where is my relief rally? yeah, i mean, this is the thing, yeah
you know, we did have already this, this kind of relief rally, higher levels
you know, the possibilities of this rolling back down was kind of higher because we are in a big, massive downtrend
so possibilities of price action going to lower levels, you know, what's higher, right? was higher
i'm actually interested in trading, you know, higher levels to short or lower levels too long
you know, there's an incredible potential harmonic pattern that i don't want to talk about just yet, just in case we actually retest, you know, 25 000 and lower, because then there won't be any harmonic pattern
because we already can have harmonic patterns if we create a bottom on bitcoin at the 382 fibonacci
from this low to the highs, we already had a potential harmonic
so in between 382 and 088, you know, depending on if we do get a consolidation and a bounce, it's gonna be looking very, very nice
this is something that i would talk in the future videos, not yet, because it's still pure speculation
there is a strong level here, okay, which would be in between 27 and 28 000
i'm looking for that six, one, eight, from the low to the high
it's going to be a major level, very hard level to actually, you know, a lot of people are going to come extremely bearish
and, you know, depending on how we react, as soon as we see a reaction here on several four hourly candles, and that will be the moment to step in, okay? because, you know, this is just technical analysis
you know, probably, you you are waiting with limit orders over here
you know, we might fall down and, you know, come and and actually dip below 25 000
and then, i know a lot of people might think, hey, you were talking about this range to potentially hold
you could have five, six, seven indicators, you know, saying that this is a major, big level, and we're going to bounce, but then it just breaks
waiting for a reaction is the best thing you can do as a trader
in between today and tomorrow, i'm very excited for this range
mark dutch seb, how are you doing? let's go through the comment section
do you think bitcoin can reach 10k in this bear market? can it reach 10 000? we already got 65 people saying no
we're not absolute billionaires, okay? we're not, you know, whales
and, um, you know, the more people think about something, the more it is not going to happen
if you watched a video not long ago, a few days ago, i've seen gareth holloway, crypto sally, you know, several people right now, and a technical analyst talking about, you know, comparison with dot com bubble, with amazon chart
like the 2000s, and the dotcom bubble got up to a 10 trillion market capitalization in pure speculation
and, you know, if you count inflation, you know, it should have been 20 trillion dollars, right? for for a dotcom bubble kind of scenario
so, dotcom bubble was much, much higher in volume, okay, in dollars, then crypto
crypto didn't even reach three trillion dollars at the pop of this bubble, right? so, and and back in 2000s, you know, the entirecom bubble reached over 10 trillion dollars
and if you count inflation, you know, that might have been over six times
in my personal opinion, guys, it's just my personal opinion, but i see a lot of people right now comparing dot com bubble, right? you know, it is it
you know, we're gonna go so low that it's gonna give, you, you know, imagine buying amazon in in 2002, 2003, you know, getting that extremely cheap
or, you know, any other successful um, you know, there's gonna be a lot of them that are gonna go to zero and disappear, no doubt about that, just like, you know, 90 of the dotcom, uh projects back in 2000
you need to be clever enough to think that, you know, bitcoin is king
i would stick with ethereum, some l1 projects, some l2 projects, of course
and, you know, if you really strongly believe in some gaming projects or something, you know, diversify
because, you know, you in five, six years, you can absolutely be set for life, if you do invest properly
so, um, anyway, it's just a little bit of talk, talk that i want to talk about
stocks have a long history, and many, many people understand it
crypto is tech that the general public will take a long time to even understand yet, alone invest in
but, you know, this is the thing, you know, there's so many things that can happen with blockchain and different technology inside of a link, yet, chain link, absolutely emmy, absolutely
i think chain link is gonna be one of them that is going to be here, still, in the next five to ten years
it will be one of them that is going to stand out, absolutely for chain link press popcorn
i mean, this is the thing, but how many people did understand the dotcom? i i've seen videos from early 90s and late 90s
you know, people talking about internet just the same as people talking about crypto today
you got all of these people from cnbc, you know, you name it, fox news, fox business, and, you know, saying about, what is cryptocurrency? what is this? what is blockchain? you know? and you can see videos from, you know, the mid 90s, people still not even knowing what internet is, and, you know, what does it do? you know, it's absolutely incredible, because some, there are some similarities there
it was like, yeah, this strange thing that goes really slow on computer
and people, you know, many stories, very, many interesting stories about the internet
because i, you know, i've seen stories of internet in the early 90s, you know, where you could download a newspaper, you could download news on the internet
you know, why am i going to download, you know, something that i can buy just, you know, two minutes away from home that costs 30 cents? i buy the newspaper because it's going to take over two hours to download this piece of news that i want to read right now
uh, so, the same thing, same kind of similarities on crypto right now
you know, the tech, there's some technology that will absolutely revolutionize the world, decentralization
so, anyway, that's only my opinion, and i do think that we are going to see the biggest opportunity right now, the next few years
and it is what it is, uh? i am 50 years old, i remember? says rodney cowden, well, absolutely
you know, having someone here watching the live stream that's 50 years old
you know, the internet, you know, i was only, i don't know, i remember the 2000s
i'm 31 right now, but, uh, the stories that i hear right now from, you know, videos from the early 90s, it was absolutely incredible
internet was just an absolute big thing that, you know, only a few understood and only a few speculated
and let's zoom out on solana and keep it pretty simple, because, um, solana basically came down to a very strong point of control here on the vpvr, which is that 45
as you can see, we did actually dip slightly below 40, but you could see that reaction on solana almost hitting 60, okay, just a couple of days ago
you know, you could speculate, if you are a trader, if you know what you're doing, you know that this big, major consolidation from 2021, okay, from april to july
reaccumulations are heavy support once you come down back to hit it
and you are seeing here, in the short term, that major bounce from this zone
okay? volume profile gets you the average of most of the volume traded from a zone
this is why you usually bounce from the highest peak, okay? and you can see the highest peak here being around about 42
you know, that volatility, that major panic, you know, capitulation phase and getting that reaction
it's going to take a lot of panic and a lot of selling pressure to dip down below, you know, this 2021
okay? there's been a multimonthly here, about four months of accumulation, reaccumulation
it has to, you know, something bad needs to happen if we were to break the the summer lows of 2021
in the case of solana breaking below 20 something really bad needs to happen
i remember seeing solana one when it was launched at two dollars
i was so invested in different other things on on on the actual hype that, um, yeah, solano
well, um, yeah, probably jackie wood, i got my mother here in the comment section
i got my moderators, um, saying hello to to my mum here in the comment section
can you take a look at cardano? let's take a look at cardano here
you know, i think this range is going to be an accumulation zone on solana
okay, just to keep it straight forward, you know, we have been dumping like crazy
we could still have several months of bearishness, all depending on what, how bitcoin reacts to the market
but i think, you know, if bitcoin wasn't to break below twenty thousand dollar range, solana could enter accumulation zone in between twenty dollars and fifty dollars
all right, it could be an accumulation zone if bitcoin behaves, if bitcoin does manage to stay above 20 000, which i strongly believe it could happen
but if, if we do have a black swan event, such as march of 2020, we know what happened in march of 2020
i was, you know, so invested in cryptocurrency, and i was working as welder back then
you know, i was just getting an average wage here, back here here in spain, i remember losing 60 of my portfolio, and i have a few hundred dollars spare at the end of the month, in march of 2020
so if you see bitcoin, you know, hitting, you know, who knows, 10 000 by the end of the year, or, you know, beginning of 2023
and, you know, if it were to go to zero, which i think is unlikely, of course, i'm not gonna sell anything
don't get this as financial advice, as i'm gonna sell the house, my car and put everything in
but i will be, you know, getting my stable coin reserves, uh, my euros, because i am from spain, i'm from europe
i'll be, you know, gathering everything to to to get in, because i do see an opportunity of a lifetime, because the financial system, the traditional financial system is absolutely broken
inflation is going off the roof, uh, you know, um, we can actually talk, you know, many, many hours here on on the actual financial system, and it's totally broken
we could actually do a live stream, just concentrating on that
this bear market is the opportunity of a lifetime for the next coming years, guys
you know, i will, i will be happy if we go to 10 000, no doubt, i will be happy
i i'm gonna tell you, i have only two stable coins, the only two stable coins that i hold
and i'm thinking and getting in to die, because i know die is pretty pretty good also
i feel very sorry for a lot of lunatics, a lot of people that were so bullish in ust, you know, in the in the lunar ecosystem
i have actually not researched, uh, luna fully, but it was a total ponzi
i got some of my mods sending me a a really cool video from some youtuber, you know, actually calling it that luna is going to go to zero
but it was very, very interesting to see actually, you know, this guy making the the proper research that a lot of us don't even do
um, so is usdt in danger? no, the thing is, um, there would have to be like a run on the bank, right? they would have to be everybody changing their usdt to dollars, to real paper dollars
how many of you living, wherever you live in the country is going to go tomorrow and, you know, get all of their money out? you know, if it happens, then they won't allow you to get it out because there's obviously not enough reserve
they haven't got a hundred percent of, you know, the backed dollars that, um, you have
i think they only have about 30 or 40 percent, which is absolutely a bit scary
usdc is more backed than usdt, but usdt, you know, actually uses your dollars also to try and make more money, right? and, um, it's not fully backed, which is scary
so if if there were to be a run in the run on the bank, on usdt, then, yeah, it's, it's probably going to be, um, it's going to be dangerous
we might see the usdt value go to 90, 80, 70 cents or, uh, it would be very interesting to see
okay, not financial advice, but, yeah, definitely have more than two, you know, more than one, at least two or three different stable coins that have a good track record
um, let me take a look at this superchat here from jersey, and i'll take a look at, uh, another a few uh, a few comments right now
you know, you know, i think most of the people should know, okay, there are a lot of people that are new that, you know, get actually panic
and it's, it's funny to see a lot of people saying, you know, bitcoin's going to 20k
and, um, yeah, you just get kind of used to it, right? you know, i'm waiting for the next coming years
you know, if you invest here, right at these levels, if you invest heavily at these levels, this crash is just, you know, your per your portfolio just going down in percentage
so, anyway, i did explain this, you know, maybe a lot of people you are here are very experienced, you know, and this is just a load of nonsense, but it is true
you know what? the very likely scenario that will happen in the next coming years, if we were to come down two to ten thousand dollars, you know, by 2023, 2024, by 2025, 2026, you're going to see an absolutely huge rally, you know, to the upside
less than five percent of the world are actually, you know, using bitcoin and crypto
and more than, i think it was more than 40 percent of the world is using internet right now, much more than 40 percent
so, yeah, you know, crypto and and crypto tech is still a baby
it's still so lo so much to happen still in the next coming years
um, i've been waiting, waiting for the crash since coved crash says halam
back in 2017, i did hear something about crypto, but i was mainly focused on stocks
was the actual bull run, when i was one of those people that got into the news, got into the hype
you know, what is this? and then, you know, in the bear market, instead of investing, you know, the beginning of 2018, i started, you know, learning about bitcoin
you know, what is this in? where is this industry going right? this this cryptocurrency space
and then once i started to understand it, i was, you know, heavily getting invested here
um, where do you trade oil? what photo oil? i trade in primix bt
the good thing about primex bt is that you can use four cryptocurrencies at this moment
you can use bitcoin, you can use ethereum, you can use usdt, or you can use usdc as collateral
okay, so if you want to, if you're a good trader, trading oil or forex or gold, you can actually use bitcoin as money
so you gain, you know, you can see here, unrealized profits, 87 82 worth of value
they pay me in bitcoin because i'm using bitcoin as collateral
so, uh, in crypto stable coins, which is absolutely phenomenal
wix, you know, they have over 50 assets, uh, to to trade with
if you deposit a thousand dollars, you're getting seventy dollars on top of that, on top of your trading funds to trade with, which is absolutely phenomenal
uh, seven percent is a pretty nice bonus on top of your deposit
chad moore says, opinion on aid, mark durch gave me insane support
what is my opinion on apecoin? well, apecoin was just another, another hype
you know, i was talking about, you know, this is just another bubble that's gonna pop, uh, when we are, when we were at higher levels
yeah, eight coin is very, very likely gonna go to lower levels
um, a retest of this five dollar area looks like imminent at this moment, or almost five dollars
um, it's been really good by bouncing from major resistance and and support levels
you can actually trade eight coin on by bit, um, and, yeah, i didn't trade a coin, but i did trade gmt
and i think we could actually roll slightly more to the downside, hitting that five to six dollar range
okay, um, we actually below the biggest point of control from this consolidation
you know, this just looks like a dead cat bounce, ready to have, you know, with the lower highs, ready to have that, that retest of the lows, or very close to the lows, you could create a slightly higher low, but that is very likely the the direction where we are going
just, no one has been talking about gmt, um, but, uh, yeah, here in the comment section
i did a video or just beside bitcoin, on a daily update, you know, talking about this huge resistance
and this also, this consolidation here, this, this pennant on gmt was also absolutely insane
you know, the probabilities on this permanent breaking down was much higher coming from this aggressive drop
and, you know, look at this, this major level, the two dollar range on gmt, insane support
you know, the biggest point of control from the range, you know, it was, this was a a get in, get in a short position right there, because you are very likely going to make some gains
and when you retest the lows, we actually went to much lower levels
we had an important level here, back in 31st of march, where we did create this low
what level am i talking about? the 17175 range, approximately
you know this 170 range, a 180, 170, you know this range, you know, plus minus a few dollars because of volatility, getting that rejection
and i think that this is very likely to happen right now, that we are not going to manage to break above the 175 and actually retest these lows at the the one dollar range, uh? on on gmt
let's take a look at axiomfinity, the, you know, most popular gaming play to earn project, which, um, absolutely exploded
and axe infinity just to be the classic, you know, number one play to earn game, this will be very likely, one one of them that will recover
um, not financial advice, of course, this could go to zero and absolutely disappear
they did have some security issues, but this is something that you cannot, you know, you cannot see the future
who knows how much security there is really backing all of this, all of these projects
but i think it will be one of them as being the number one play to earn
you know, this one will enter a floor range inside of the bear market, which, you know, it will recover
um, you know, axe infinity can go as low as eight, eight, ten dollars, potentially is the, it's the level where we do see the consolidation of 2021, largest consolidation we see march till july
this is where we have one of the biggest, you know, points of control here
i mean, look at this insane volume in between, you know, of course, the two dollars and the ten dollar range, the the high, you know, the value area high from this consolidation range
so, i mean, this is very possible, going to be very near the bottom, you know, axe infinity, you know, close to the 10 is going to be a, maybe, an accumulation zone for many, many months
so, yeah, we actually, you know, pretty pretty amazing that we actually retested the lows from july of 2021 here at about 14, and got an exact bounce from that range here, slightly above, slightly above, we had a big spike on the vpvr at that level
and we actually, you know, we did get that bounce the last few days from this 14, 15 range you can see on the four hourly here, not exactly touching the lows from july, but we were close enough, close enough to retest the lows
um, anyway, not much to add, of course, all depending on bitcoin, or depending on the sentiment
um, natalie, bitcoin census, how are you doing? hello natalie
looking at bitcoin, we have broken this support from this small, ascending channel, uh, not a huge amount of volume
i think we could come to lower levels, but i am looking for that potential bounce, as you know, guys
okay, i have, i haven't done any research on this coin, but i have heard about it
uh, this one had a, um, you know, an insane bull run back in in in the days, back in the days, in 2017, you know, this one went as high as, wow, you know, four dollars, you know, this was trading at four dollars back in, you know, late 2017, early 2018
i have no opinion on this, looking at the charts, basically, we can go zoom out on the weekly
something good that i can say about this one is that we are actually trading at the highs from the bear market of 2018, 2019, you know, uh, even, you know, 2020, you know, the eight cents
we are trading at their biggest point of control from the last four years, meaning that it's been the cheapest price really
it's, they're giving up whatever, you know, you invested here, you invested here, you invested here, you invested here, you invested here
so this is why, you know, you this is the thing, you could have a multimonthly accumulation zone in between one cent and and and eight cents on this crypto
and it's just going to take a long time for a potential big, big, you know, big, massive hype
unfortunately, bear market has hit aggressively the last few weeks
but it's another upcoming project that has, you know, a lot of good things coming
because there's been so much hate on casters, so much hate, it's absolutely incredible
and i'm telling you, there will be something coming out of caster, all right? and it's absolutely insane
i mean, i get so many the comments, also, bashing, you know, me about caster
but, you know, they have been having some issues, um, with the, with the actual app
what's going on with eth? what is going on with eth? looking at the charts, big, massive dumpage, huge, massive dump uh
we're looking at this, you know, um, keeping it simple, keeping it in a nutshell
we we almost hit this support level, which was at the two thousand two hundred dollars
my name is josh, and today the stock market is pulling back, which is placing some selling pressure on the bitcoin price
but in just a moment, i'll be sharing a brand new bitcoin chart that tells us how much longer it could take before the bitcoin price finally starts flipping more bullish again
and right now, at the time of recording this video, the bitcoin price is still trading around that range of support coming into play at around 29 to 30 000 per bitcoin
and as of right now, we're still yet to see a daily candle close well below 29 000
so in order to confirm a break below this massive range of support, we need to see at least a daily candle close below 29 000, but ideally a weekly candle close below 29 000
but if you're zooming into the shorter term, taking look at the four hour bitcoin charts, like i said yesterday, this four hour bitcoin bullish divergence was starting to wear off, because we saw a lower high in the rsi
and basically the rsi has now reversed back into a shortterm downtrend on the fourhour charts
and we've seen something similar in the bitcoin price as well
basically we've just formed a lower high and a lower low on the fourhour time frame
talking about the shorter term, but once again, this is what i was talking about towards the beginning of yesterday's bitcoin update video, when the bitcoin price was sitting around here
and today i'm giving you a quick update on these bitcoin short positions on the bitfenix exchange, because i also talked about this in yesterday's bitcoin update video
and just quickly recapping what i said yesterday, essentially, when we see a spike in the short positions on this particular exchange, that usually means we're at some sort of local bottom in the bitcoin price, and we're about to see some more bullish price action in the shorter term, especially if we keep seeing the short positions continue to close
and obviously, if you're looking at the bitcoin short positions on the bitfinex exchange right now, we still have more room to the downside in the shorts, which basically means the bitcoin price could trend in the somewhat bullish direction over the next one to two weeks, if we see those shorts keep closing, like these previous examples
but if we do not see these bitcoin short positions go down, and instead we see a gradual increase in these bitcoin short positions, that would basically be the more bearish scenario, because while the shot positions are increasing, that is placing an extra selling pressure on the bitcoin price
because you can see in these previous examples, anytime we see a slow, gradual increase in the bitcoin short positions, at least on this particular exchange, that simply means we're in for some more shortterm bearish price action, at the very least
and then when we see a rapid increase, a very sharp spike in these short positions, that's how you know we're at some sort of local bottom in the bitcoin price
so i'm definitely keeping a close eye on these bitcoin short positions, and obviously i'll update you if anything changes
now when you zoom all the way out to the weekly bitcoin charts, bringing out the 1 000 day simple moving average and the 200 week simple moving average, and if you've been subscribed to this channel for longer than a week, you will know that these two moving averages give us an accumulation range of a lifetime, historically speaking
and for anyone that might be new to the channel, this just means that any time the bitcoin price, throughout bitcoin's price history, enters in between these moving averages, that has given us the accumulation of a lifetime
obviously, if you dollar cost averaged into bitcoin while the bitcoin price was between these two moving averages throughout bitcoin's history, you would have done very well
and right now these two moving averages are coming in between 22 000 and 28 000
so basically in that price range is where i personally am going heavier into bitcoin
and outside of that price range, i'm just slowly dollar cost averaging into bitcoin by default
and what you do with your money is completely up to you, obviously
and just before i get into this brand new bitcoin chart, just quickly taking a look at this weekly bitcoin chart while we're still on the weekly time frame
because if you're looking at the weekly bitcoin rsi, we're getting even closer towards oversold territories
and keep in mind, the last time the weekly bitcoin rsi entered into oversold territories was at the exact 2018 bear market bottom
and in fact, right now the weekly bitcoin rsi is trading slightly below the bottom of the march 2020 crash
and as i've already mentioned multiple times recently on the channel, we've seen a massive spike in volume on the weekly bitcoin charts, which usually tells us the bitcoin price has either bottomed out after a significant crash, or it's very close to the bitcoin bottom, like what we saw in the 2018 bear market
we saw that massive spike in volume on that initial crash, and then we saw one more dump to the downside, but it wasn't that much lower compared to that initial drop
and the same can be said about what we saw in the middle of last year
we saw that initial drop down towards 30 000 during may, where we saw that spike in volume, and then we had one more dip to the downside, down towards around 29 000, and then we bottomed out at that price
so once again, this spike in volume on the weekly bitcoin chart tells us that we've either hit the bottom, or we are very close to the bitcoin bottom, historically speaking
and now when you zoom out to the monthly bitcoin chance and taking a look at the monthly bitcoin rsi, this is very interesting, because if you're looking at these previous two bitcoin bear markets, they played out the exact same in terms of the amount of time from a bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd to the bottom of the bear market, just zooming in closer
and if you're looking at the monthly bitcoin rsi, we saw a bearish cross right here in august 2014, about halfway through the 2014 bear markets
and this green vertical line just here is placed at the bear marker bottom
in fact, if i just delete that line, you can see the wick that formed the bottom of the 2014 bear market, down towards around 160 dollars per bitcoin
and if you simply measure the amount of time between this bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd to the bear market bottom, that right there, i don't know if you can see this, but it says five bars, which is essentially five full candles
and since we're on the monthly chart, that is, of course, five months between the bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd and the bear market bottom
so that is why i've placed this green line five months away from that bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd
because once again, that marked the bottom of the bear market
it's now looking at the next major bitcoin bear market, which was, of course, the 2018 bear markets
and once again, what we saw here was a bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd around halfway through the 2018 bear markets
and then if i take away this green line, just for the time being, so you can actually see the lowest week in the bitcoin price during 2018
and if you simply measure the amount of time between this bearish cross and the bottom of the 2018 bear market, that was exactly five candles
so five months between the bearish cross in the monthly bitcoin macd and the bear market bottom
and this is very interesting, because we saw a bearish cost in the monthly bitcoin macd back in january this year
and so if you simply measure out five months from that time just then that actually puts us in june, so next month
so when you're simply going off the two previous significant bitcoin bear markets, which were 2014 and 2018, and going off the monthly bitcoin macd, we could be around one month away from turning around in the bitcoin price, basically flipping from bearish back into bullish
so just because this has perfectly played out two previous times in the past, it doesn't 100 guarantee anything in the future
and something else to consider is, if you're looking at these previous bitcoin bear markets, it's not like we bottomed out and then immediately went to the moon
for example, at the end of the 2018 bear market, we had around three to four months worth of sideways consolidation, basically just a somewhat boring accumulation range, before then the bitcoin price began to explode in early 2019
in fact, the entire year of 2015 was a very boring year for the bitcoin price, because for most of 2015 the bitcoin price was in a massive accumulation range, and then began to explode, entering into 2016 and of course 2017
but even though these were very boring times to be involved in bitcoin, they were by far the most valuable times to be involved in bitcoin, obviously
because if you took advantage of these accumulation opportunities, obviously you did very well in the coming years if you held on
so that is why i'm still covering bitcoin every day here on this channel
and like i said earlier, if the bitcoin price goes any lower, for example, if we dip back into this accumulation range, below 28 000, down towards 22 000, for example, then in that scenario, i'll personally increase my bitcoin purchases the lower we go
obviously, today the nasdaq 100 index here on the daily timeframe, has been trading down
and so as i always say, the stock markets and the bitcoin price are correlated with each other, at least in the shorter term, which means if the stock market sees a pullback, then it's very likely that the bitcoin price is going to play out some sort of pullback at the very least
and obviously that has been playing out so far in the shorter term today
but zooming out to the weekly time frame, looking at the nasdaq 100 index, the weekly rsi is actually entering into oversold territories right now
and the last time the weekly rsi for the nasdaq 100 index got anywhere close to oversold territories was back during the march 2020 crash, which was technically a recession for a few months during 2020
and then if you're looking at the 2018 bear market, we also got pretty close to oversold territories in the weekly rsi
but whether or not the bitcoin price goes up, down or sideways, you can actually keep making money in crypto
and if you want to know how to do that, check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen
because in both of these videos, i review how i continue to make money in crypto no matter what prices are doing
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
my name is josh, and this bitcoin indicator is flashing a signal that predicted the last two bitcoin pumps
and on top of that, we have the bitcoin fee in grid index at a multiyear low, while the stock market is still bouncing from that load that we saw last week
and so i'll be talking about all of that and more later in this video
and obviously, we're still holding above that range of supports coming into play at around 29 to 30 000
but apart from that, there's nothing much else to add here on top of what i said yesterday
so zooming into the fourhour bitcoin chart, and you can clearly see that we're still playing out that bullish divergence, which is resulting in mostly choppy, sideways price action, as we've seen over the past few days, as expected
but considering the fact that this bullish divergence is only visible on smaller time frames like the four hour chart, it is starting to wear off
because the rsi, for example, has just formed a lower high on the four hour charts, and generally speaking, a smaller bullish divergence like this, on the four hour charts, for example, normally last for a few days, maybe up towards around a week, before it starts to wear off
so this price action that we've seen over the past few days, close to over the past week, has been pretty much what i normally expect from a four hour bullish divergence
so due to the fact that this four hour bullish divergence might be beginning to wear off, we could see some more volatility return, potentially towards the end of this week, maybe going into next week
and a chart that i am paying attention to is this bitcoin chart right here, which is basically just the six hour bitcoin charts, but with this indicator, which is essentially the bitcoin short positions on the bitfinex exchange
and what is really interesting about these specific bitcoin shot positions is we normally see a massive spike in short positions come in right at a bitcoin bottom, or at least a local bitcoin bottom, just before the bitcoin price pumps back to the upside
and if we simply take a look at the last couple of times this has happened in the bitcoin short positions on the bitfinex exchange, that happened right around here and right around here
and obviously, if you're looking at the bitcoin price action during those two time periods where we saw a spike in the bitcoin short positions, in both of those examples, they turned out to be great buying opportunities, at least for the shorter term
because in the first example, the bitcoin price pumped over the next one week, approximately, before experiencing another bitcoin dump
and in the second example, the bitcoin price pumped for the next two weeks, over two weeks, before then the bitcoin price turned around again
now something important to point out is obviously this spike just here actually occurred around four to five days ago, which means, simply, based on these two previous examples, according to the bitcoin short positions on the bitfenix exchange, the next bitcoin pump might be shortlived
but with that being said, we still have quite a lot of bitcoin short positions still active on this particular exchange compared to these previous examples, which means, obviously, there is still more room to the downside in the short positions, which is actually bullish for the bitcoin price if those short positions continue to close
so simply, based on this alone, we could be due for some more bullish price action in the shorter term at the very least
we need to be looking at some more indicators, such as the bitcoin fee ingredient index, which today has dropped down to a value of 8, which is extremely low
in fact, if you look at the entire history of this bitcoin fee and grid index, dating back since the beginning of 2018, the last time the bitcoin fee and grid index was this low, at a value of 8 or lower, that was actually back during march 2020, during that huge crash that we saw back then, while the stock market was also crashing
and even though warren buffett might not understand bitcoin, he is definitely right when he says, get greedy when others are fearful, and be fearful when others are greedy
because obviously, if you got greedy, if you started buying a lot of bitcoin during march 2020, as the fee and grid index was down towards eight, you would have done very well
and then if you got fearful, as the bitcoin fee ingrid index was sitting in extreme greed, up towards around 90 to 95, back in february 2021, you would have also done it pretty well
and then the next swing to the downside during june and july 2021
the bitcoin feet and grid index was sitting in extreme fear for most of that time period
and obviously, if you got greedy during that time period, you would have done very well over the coming months
and then the bitcoin fee ingrid index got back towards greed back in october and november last year
and once again, if you took some profits off the table when the bitcoin fee and grid index was sitting in greed, you would have done very well over the coming months
in fact, if i plot those times of extreme fear and extreme greed on the bitcoin chart itself here, on the three day time frame, once again, we experienced extreme fear back in march 2020, right around here
and then the bitcoin fee and grid index entered back into extreme greed during this time period right here
and then it dropped back into extreme fear during june and july 2021, and then back into greed during october and november 2021
and once again, right now we're currently sitting in extreme fear
in fact, the most fear we've seen since march 2020, which is very interesting and definitely something to consider
and obviously, looking at the threeday bitcoin rsi, this has been oversold recently with the recent crash down towards 25 000
and the last time that the threeday bitcoin rsi well and truly entered into oversold territories, that was back during march 2020
and the time before that was at the end of the 2018 bear market
and something very similar can also be said about the monthly bitcoin rsi, approaching into the lower half of the rsi bands
and we've actually only ever seen this happen just three other times in bitcoin's entire price history
and of course, those time periods were march 2020, the end of the 2018 bear market and the end of the 2014 bear market leading into 2015
and over on the weekly bitcoin chart, the weekly bitcoin rsi is not yet in oversold territories
so technically speaking, this does have some more room to the downside
but keep in mind, the march 2020 crash did not see the weekly bitcoin rsi enter into oversold territories
and in fact, right now we're basically at the same level as what the weekly bitcoin rsi was sitting at during the march 2020 crash
and of course, as i've been mentioning, over the past few days, we've seen a massive spike in volume on the weekly bitcoin charts, which usually happens around the time of a bitcoin bottom, or very close to a bitcoin bottom, historically speaking
so simply, based on a lot of confluence between multiple different charts, indicators and signals, it is simply more likely for the bitcoin price to trend in the general bullish direction for at least the next couple weeks or so, basically just talking about the somewhat shorter term
and if you want to know the midterm for bitcoin, as in, let's just say a few months from now, then we need to be keeping an eye on what the stock market is doing
and this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and today we have seen a continuation in this bounce in the stock market that has formed since the end of last week
now obviously this is very far away from being a full bullish recovery, but with that being said, we need to see the stock markets bounce in order to see some more bullish price action for crypto
so if we actually get about in the stock market, this can really help out bitcoin play out some more bullish price action
because, in case you're new to this channel, the stock market and the bitcoin price are very correlated, which basically just means if we see a lot of bearish price action in the stock market, it's very likely we'll see something similar for bitcoin, and vice versa
if we see a lot of bullish price action in the stock market, we're most likely going to see something similar for bitcoin as well
but whether or not we do play out some more bullish price action, or potentially some more bearish price action, there's still ways to make money in crypto
and if you want to know how to do that, make sure you're checking out one of these uploads popping up right here on your screen
because in both of these videos, i review how i continue to make money in crypto no matter what prices are doing
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
the bitcoin price is currently hanging around the 30 000 mark
but i'm sure what you all came here for is not what it's currently doing, but it's what it's going to do next
um, i have a new chart that i haven't shown for quite some time, which is up here
you can put on a weekly or on a twoweek, but essentially it shows you when you're getting into areas of overvalue or undervalue
so anytime you kind of reach the lower end of that trend line over there, then that is an area where you can start paying attention as an investor
and the only reason that i'm bringing this chart up for you is just to show you that there is confluence in the zone
and if you have a look at where the bottom of this trend line comes in, it's currently sitting at about 23 000
you will notice as well that occasionally there have been times where we wick or even close a a candle or two below that zone
but i, as an investor, would be looking to load up in that zone
and ultimately, the point of today's stream will be to let you know that the real time when you want to start to be looking to get aggressive on your lungs is going to be when the fed pivots from the hawkish stance which they've currently had, into a more damaged on
so we need to see, are they going to raise rates to 75 basis points, or are they going to move down from the 50, which you've currently been experiencing, and go down to 25? if they, as soon as that pivot takes place, where they move from 50 to 25, or let's say they go 70 and then back to 50, that's where i would anticipate that basically i'd be looking to to take your lungs
so what i would love to see is, i'd love to see price come down again, and they raise rates to 75 basis points
and right as they take their pivot, we are sitting in this region of 22, 23 000
that would be a confluence area with the pivot, as well as an area of historical support to be taking long
now, you're going to see a lot of talk, i'm already seeing it on twitter, with the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, red weekly candles in a row, which you've never experienced before
so basically the bulls are coming in and saying, well, we've never had that before, so most likely we're not going to have an eighth week
well, i would caution you along that line of thinking and suggest that you rather just stick with the trend, wait for confirmation zones
well, firstly, this could be one thing to watch, which is, again, going to be the dexi
it closed above that 10376, which i told you we hadn't had a weekly close above that level, i believe it's in something like 22 years
the soonest that i would say this is turning is if you take out the previous week's low, which is going to be over here, let's just put on the magnet to get it exact
so if you can take out 103372 on the dexi, then that could be some sort of confirmation that there is a reversal happening on the dexie
and that will give some relief to bitcoin and all risk on assets
and again, this is going to most likely tie in with what the fed is doing
the fed is in full control of what's happening with the market right now through the raising of rates
we had the 200 moving average, which is, which is the white one over here
and any time that has been lost historically, although we only have three examples in the past, you were looking at a 50 drawdown
and again, i told you to remember that zone, it comes at around 20 000
we have a little bit of hope for the next two weeks, which is going to be a full moon
and on this chart over here, we have our weekly you tag this zone over here, which was, uh, let's just double check which one that is
and then you have the purple 200 moving average, which is more applicable as bitcoin becomes older and older, you really want to start looking at it for the longer terms on the 200 ma
so again, where does that come the confluence is still there at 22 000
i would be looking for a possible tag of that, uh, moving average
so the last time that we did this video, i said mentioned over here that getting above this green box territory could be a signal to take along
i was targeting twenty seven thousand seven hundred and fifty seven
formed a little bit of a diagonal trend line, which is currently holding
price pushed back up into that box at 31 200, we had a deviation again
what is a deviation? the deviation is essentially when price goes above and peaks back down
i would say, as soon as you lose this area over here, you can confirm that deviation, and then again, the target back down
so once you break that trend line over there, you confirm the deviation, target would be, again, to the 27 757
so with that being said, i'm having a look at what my momentum oscillators are doing
and as long as price holds within this level, they will continue to to move back down
and if they do manage to start to come get to these levels, and price, at the same time, is turning in either one of these zones, that would be my signal for taking a spot long
bear in mind again that any time that you are taking long positions in this market, you are counter to the overall trend, right? so the overall trend is still down and will remain that way
what you really want to see is, you want to see price slow down
so going back onto the logarithmic chart over here, what you want to see is if price can, let's just get that off there
so if you see price come strong down into there and then back up, you want to see a bit of a consolidation, since it's a bear market
and these accumulation zones always come so don't panic and think that you're not going to get a chance to get in
there is always opportunities within the crypto market, and you just need to remain patient

i'll keep you up to date there, because the market changes rapidly
price is stuck in a range between twenty nine thousand dollars and thirty one thousand dollars
so i would expect that it's going to probably bounce around in that zone like this until we leave that zone
my name is josh, and over the past one day, we've just seen a weekly candle close for bitcoin, which has confirmed this massive spike of volume in place
stock market has held up relatively well today after seeing a bit of a bounce towards the end of last week
and this is actually important to pay attention to for all crypto holders
first of all, just giving you a quick update on the daily bitcoin chart
and you can clearly see that the bitcoin price is still holding above this range of supports at around 29 to 30 thousand dollars
so for as long as the bitcoin price is holding above that range of support, honestly, we're not looking too bad
but zooming into the shorter term, taking a look at the fourhour bitcoin charts, and obviously, we're still playing out that choppy, sideways price action that i've been talking about over the past few days
because it was as soon as these bullish diversions formed on the four hour bitcoin charts that i said we're likely to reduce our bearish momentum in the shorter term, but not necessarily see a lot of bullish price action, which would result in mostly choppy, sideways price action for the next few days
and obviously, because of the fact that the 4hour bitcoin rsi is still in an uptrend, this is still what i'm expecting in the shorter term, once again, some more sideways price action
and this type of price action is actually very normal after a bitcoin crash, but because the bitcoin price just needs some time to stabilize
but with that being said, i should update you on what's happening with that potential inverse head and shoulders pattern that i talked about yesterday on the channel
obviously, the bitcoin price initially broke out to the upside
we did see one four hour candle close above the neckline, which is technically one confirmation for these breakouts
but as always, i talked about how ideally we need to see some sort of retest in order to have more confidence in the breakout to the upside, because otherwise, one confirmation isn't a lot of confirmation
and you can clearly see, the bitcoin price came back down towards the neckline
and essentially, if we held that neckline, which was coming in at around 301 k approximately, then in that case, a bounce from that level would have further confirmed that breakouts
but the fact that the bitcoin price broke back below that neckline with at least one four hour candle close, and currently that neckline is now back to acting as resistance, this inverse header shoulders pattern has now been invalidated
but what hasn't been invalidated is what we're seeing on the weekly bitcoin chart, looking at the weekly bitcoin volume
and as i mentioned in the intro of this video, with that candle closed, that actually confirmed this massive spike of volume in place
and this is actually a big deal for bitcoin, because basically, anytime we see a massive bitcoin crash, it's usually when we see a massive spike in volume, that is when the bitcoin price essentially meets its bottom, or gets very close to the bottom, as i discussed in more detail in yesterday's bitcoin update video
and if you're looking at last week's spike in volume, that was actually the third biggest spike in volume that we have seen in five plus years, at least when you're talking about the spikes of volume that happened during a bitcoin capitulation that basically marked the bottom for that crash
the only two other examples over the past five plus years where we've seen a bigger spike in volume than what we've seen right now during a bitcoin crash has been in the may 2021 crash and the march 2020 crash
and obviously, in the coming months, basically as we approach towards the end of the year, we saw a lot more bullish price action, because it was when we saw those spikes in volume that was basically when the bitcoin price bottomed out, or got very close to the bitcoin bottom, as we experienced in the middle of last year
so basically, according to the weekly bitcoin volume, which historically speaking, has been a very accurate indicator at determining bitcoin bottoms, the bitcoin price has either already hit the bottom at around 25 000, or it is very close to the bottom
and if it's the ladder of those two, then i'll be targeting towards the 200 week simple moving average, which is currently coming in at just above 22 000 per bitcoin, if we break 25 000, which might not happen
so this is why i've been telling you, personally, i'm dollar cost averaging heavily within these moving averages, which is basically between the 1 000 day moving average and the 200 week moving average
because historically speaking, all of the bitcoin price that has occurred between these moving averages has turned out to be an amazing buying opportunity, especially if you're holding for the longer term
and so far, at the time of recording this video, even in this example, if you bought as we dropped below the 1000 day ma currently, you'll be sitting in profits
but i want to make it clear that this is not financial advice
and what has already happened, historically speaking, as my personal bitcoin strategy, which is, once again, to go heavier into bitcoin as the bitcoin price is between these moving averages
but in the meantime, by default, i am slowly dollar cost averaging into bitcoin anyway
this right here is the nasdaq 100 index on the daily time frame
and so far today, we've seen a slight pullback, but we haven't yet broken below that previous low that we set last week, down towards around 116 to 117 k
and as i've been mentioning time and time again in these videos, we need to see some sort of bottom form in the stock market before being more confident that the bottom is in for bitcoin
and that is mostly due to the stock market and the bitcoin price being really correlated with each other
stock market keeps dumping and forms a brand new lower low, then that would significantly increase the probability of the bitcoin price dumping down, potentially back towards 25k, and even down towards that 200 week moving average
but for now, looking at today's trading day, we're holding up relatively well
here on the daily time frame, we're holding up relatively well today
so as crypto holders, let's just hope we get to see a bit more of a bounty in the stock market, which could help out crypto prices
but either way, you can actually keep making money in crypto even if prices are going down
and if you want to know how to do that, make sure to check out one of these videos popping up right here on your screen
because in both of these videos, i review how i continue to make money in crypto no matter what prices are doing
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so this is where we're going to analyze the recent price action and discuss what you should look out for over the next few days
so as always, like and subscribe if you're new and you'd like to see more updates like this in the future
and you have links provided down in the description as well that take you to my public trading community community or the private community for additional trading guidance, if you're interested
so as far as bitcoin goes, uh, we have pushed all the way down to about fifty point five thousand dollars, which is pretty close to the price that i was eyeing a couple of days ago, where i was discussing the probable likelihood, and this is on the daily chart, that bitcoin can drop down below the lows that we had during the middle of 2021
so this is the region where we have to think about that where a ton of traders would have their stop losses set, whether it's the bulk of retail traders or from an institutional standpoint, where they were looking to hold on to bitcoin
and this is the region where, as soon as we pushed below it, they looked to sell
so they either sold their position, as in, they were holding on to buy positions and they exit out of them, or they entered a sell stop order, meaning that they looked to buy the breakout
now one thing that we have to understand with bitcoin is that if we zoom out and we go on to the weekly chart, on the weekly time frame, uh, we have to understand that this weekly candle, in about 40 minutes, is about to close, and we still haven't closed below the lows that we had during 2021
so market structure wise, although it is still pretty bearish, the fact that we haven't closed below these lows means that there's still a good chance that bitcoin can drop down just a little bit to gather up any orders that were left down here, and it can close back up inside of this large monthly range that expands between 29k up to roughly 62k, and then we can continue pushing higher
now obviously, the likelihood of this occurring is a bit lower, and it would represent, um, a large liquidity grab on the weekly, on the monthly chart, where we temporarily just spiked below these lows, you gather up liquidity, and then you continue pushing higher
but this is, of course, one probable scenario that you have to pay attention to, which is why, as a shortterm trader, shortterm wise, uh, you could take advantage of the different types of fluctuations
but then if you're someone who is an investor and is looking to dollar cost average, or at least play some type of, some type of variation of dollar cost averaging, then you have to understand that it's all about probability from a longterm risk to reward perspective
if you're looking to dollar cost average, as i discussed in the previous updates, a good price to have entered would have been a couple hundred dollars below these lows
so that could be 27 000 or a bit lower, as we pushed into a price and balance that we had on the daily chart
so if i scroll all the way to the left, and i take out the volume profile, and i pretty much connect to to the start of the bull run that we had
or even if i start from ten thousand dollars and match it up all the way to, uh, the alltime high, or at least match it up to the top of this monthly range, then this region, 25 000 or slightly above it, is where we had the first region, uh, that represented a large price and balance
so here to the left, if you guys recall, i was paying attention to this now, 252 or 253 000 is what i was personally eyeing as this is the price, uh region where you have the least amount of volume
and so now, of course, this level has been filled as far as the price action goes but we still have another one uh below this as well for bitcoin
so although, as i discussed, we are bearish, and we have closed, and we still have yet to close below this range, another scenario, the scenario that you should look out for, is where the price action pushes lower to fill the next price and balance as this one stretches out roughly for from 199 000 up to about 219 000
and even if you just pay attention to the midpoint, you can simply look at this as 21 000, which, at that point, let me go on to the weekly chart
if we were to drop down to this price point of 21 000, this would represent a drop for bitcoin of about 70, which seems like it's very unrealistic for something like this to occur
however, not only would this line up with the high that we had during the last cycle, where bitcoin spiked pretty close to 20k, it missed that round psychological number, and then after that it crashed, but now if we also take a look at the logarithmic chart, and i go on a higher time frame, so let me go on the monthly chart
so the cycle that we had during 2011 then 2013, followed by 2017
each cycle, if i use the fibonacci retracement tool and and measure how far we corrected it during every potential bearish cycle, it roughly only corrected about 30 percent or so
so in 2011, following the crash, we fell about 30 percent, slightly above 30 percent
the next one was also 30 and the last one that we experienced during 20172018, it was closer to 40
so even if i match the low that we experienced uh, during uh during the end of 2018, up to the current alltime high was, which is 69 000, and i extend this to the right, if we are potentially entering a prolonged bearish cycle, which, again, we would have to break out of this large monthly range for that to occur
but even if you make the argument that we do, and we fall down to 21 000, it seems like a lot, but this is only a correction of not even 40 percent
so to say that it's completely unrealistic that bitcoin falls down 40 percent after it has done that throughout each cycle over time, is a little bit, uh, in my opinion, a little bit silly
because from a probable standpoint, something like that can occur
and so here you can get a representation of how you not only are, not only are experiencing these large, impulsive moves from a monthly time frame, but gradually, as the market cap increases for bitcoin, you obviously can't just continue skyrocketing, because you need more money if you want to push a certain percentage in the upwards direction
and so this also follows this gradual curve where even if we were to retrace roughly 40, that would still put bitcoin at around thousand dollars, 21, slightly below that, which would, which would fill the price and balance that i discussed here to the left
so again, if your dollar cost averaging right now, it's not a bad time to look at, uh, these recent lows, these recent prices that we just spiked into, from a risk to reward perspective
but then the next target that you can look out for, as i discussed, is 21 000 or slightly below that
so you can mark a little bit above 20 000, just in case we ever spiked down and don't reach 20 000
and even beyond that point, if we imagine going back to the logarithmic chart, let's, let's imagine that bitcoin corrects a bit further
so let's say that this we are entering a prolonged bearish cycle that lasts about a year, a couple of months to maybe a year or two
so let's just, for the sake of argument, assume that we have a massive dump of 50
so again, the low that we had 2018 all the way up to the most recent high, a 50 correction would put it down
and i'm not saying that this can occur, but this is another region where, if the chance that this happens, a couple of months from now, if this were to occur, this is the next level where you can look the dollar cost average bitcoin
okay, so this would be pretty close to the high that we had in 2019, if we look to the left
so so just a couple hundred dollars above that would mark the next region that you could look for
and of course, we have the next price and balance there as well, but it's not a significant as these two price and balances
so the one that we just filled, and the one that we are approaching if we push lower
and last thing is, on the four hour chart, you have to understand that we are arranging
so before the probable likelihood that bitcoin does drop down, uh, and continue pushing lower, if that were to happen, we have to break out of this hourly range
and as far as right now, we have pushed quite significantly into the upside
so what i would be paying attention to is for the price action to reject the upper portion of this range, which is currently probably playing out
and so i would wait for a rejection of thirty point six thousand dollars, which would line up with this four hour 50 ema
or i would be paying attention for a spike above the high that we had on may 11th, so just a few days ago
if we push a little bit higher to 32 000, so slightly above 32 000, and then push back down once again
at this point, what you can do on the hourly time frame is wait and see if we have any signs of divergence
so if the price action starts forming any higher high, and the rsi starts showing signs of a lower high than that can be
that can be a confirmation in the overbought territory that we're likely to reverse again
so this is just a shortterm scenario of what you could look out for, because that's the next region for bitcoin to push into in order to gather up liquidity with the potential chance that we continue pushing lower
so let me know your opinions on my analysis down in the comments section below
and right now a brand's new bitcoin pattern is forming that could reveal the next potential bitcoin price target
and on top of that, over on the monthly bitcoin chart, we are still in a very rare opportunity, which i'll be talking more about that later in this video
we are still finding a lot of support at around 29 to 30 000, as i've been talking about
so there's nothing much else to add here on the daily timeframe
but looking at the fourhour bitcoin charts, we can clearly see this bullish divergence is still playing out on the bitcoin price, because obviously the fourhour bitcoin rsi is still in an uptrend
and as i've been talking about over the past few days, i'm mostly expecting sideways, choppy price action, just reduced bearish momentum, basically due to this bullish divergence
and obviously, over the past few days, that's pretty much exactly what we have seen, just more sideways, choppy price action after that crash down towards 25 000 that was talking about
but while we're looking at the four hour bitcoin charts, you can see just here that we're actually forming in inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is technically a bullish pattern
but this has not been confirmed at the time of recording in this video, because we still need to see a confirmed breakout above this neckline, which is coming in at around 30 and a half thousand
and so ideally we need to see at least a four hour candle close above 30 and a half thousand in order to confirm that breakouts
but if we could also see a retest of the neckline, confirming it as new support, that would be extra confirmation
it's just if we do, that will give us more confidence that we are really breaking out to the upside
and if we do see a confirmed breakout to the upside, then that would activate the technical price target for this pattern, which, if you're measuring from the candle bodies, as more of a conservative price target, that will be coming in at around 34 and a half thousand
but if you're measuring from the bottom of this candle wick that gives us a price target at around 37 and a half thousand
and on top of that, it will still have some other points of resistance along the way
for example, this point of resistance at around 33 000, based on this previous level of support
because usually when we break below an important level of support, that flips into new resistance
but overall, in the shorter term, looking at this potential inverse header shoulders pattern and this bullish divergence, which is already playing out, honestly, the bitcoin price in the shorter term is not looking too bad, especially while we're still holding above this area of support at 29 to 30 000 once again
but of course, as we head into the new week, the stock market's going to open back up again, and then that could potentially change the direction of the bitcoin price, depending on what the stock market is doing
and of course, i'll keep you updated every day in these videos
and just checking the bitcoin fee and grid index today, even though the bitcoin price hasn't really done anything over the past couple days, we're still in extreme fee at a reading of 10, which is still really low for this index
and obviously, i talked more about this index in yesterday's bitcoin update video, because yesterday was sitting at nine, which is extremely low
so seriously, if you missed yesterday's bitcoin update video, definitely check that one out
if you want more information about this index, just here and what it means for bitcoin
and just giving you a quick update on the threeday bitcoin chart
right now, the rsi is still sitting around oversold territories, after already confirming one three daily kennel closed when the rsi was in oversold territories
and with the recent bitcoin dump, this has brought the threeday bitcoin rsi to its lowest point since march 2020
which is very interesting, because if you zoom out to the weekly bitcoin charts and bring out these two important moving averages, which are the 1 000 day simple moving average and the 200 week simple moving average, during that recent bitcoin crash, the bitcoin price entered into this price range in between these two important moving averages, which gives us an exceptional buying opportunity, historically speaking
now, i want to make it clear that this is not financial advice
i'm just telling you what has happened time and time again, throughout bitcoin's history
and clearly, every single time that the bitcoin prices entered in between these two important moving averages has turned out to be an amazing buying opportunity, especially if you're holding for the longer term
and in case you are new to this channel, these two moving averages are coming in at around two thousand and twenty eight thousand
so essentially in between those prices, just there, in that mid 20k price range, should be a generational buying opportunity, according to the history of these moving averages over a decade, basically
and while we're on the weekly bitcoin charts, of course, we have already seen a massive spike in bitcoin's volume on the weekly time frame, which usually marks the bottom for a bitcoin crash, as we've seen time and time again throughout years worth of bitcoins history
now keep in mind, out of all of the examples on the screen just here, we did have one previous example at the end of the 2018 bear markets, where we got that massive crash in the bitcoin price, the massive spike in volume
but if you're looking closely at the bitcoin price, we actually had another two weeks worth of red before we actually bottomed out for that crash
but either way, if you're just dollar cost averaging during that time period when we're seeing that massive spike in volume after that massive crash, you would have obviously done very well either way, whether you bought at three and a half thousand or 31 k
and we actually saw something similar to that back in the middle of last year
as you can see, the main crash was over when we got that massive spike in volume, but the bitcoin price still played out another two months of sideways price action, pretty much
and we did actually form one more lower low, which was around a thousand dollars lower in the bitcoin price compared to that initial low when we saw that massive spike in volume on the weekly time frame
so essentially, just going off all of these other examples over a year's worth of bitcoin's history, this massive spike in weekly volume when we see a significant bitcoin crash either means we've hit the bottom, or we are very close to the bottom, historically speaking
and you can say a very similar thing about the monthly bitcoin rsi, because right now this is entering into the lower half of the rsi
and throughout bitcoin's entire price history, we've only ever seen this happen just three other times
and obviously, if you're looking at all three of those other times this has happened, they turn out to be amazing buying opportunities, especially if you're holding for the longer term
and in fact, all three of those previous opportunities also came in confluence with the bitcoin price entering in between these two moving averages
so personally speaking, i am using this opportunity to accumulate more bitcoin at cheap prices
and if you want to know how to maximize your profits in crypto, whether or not prices are going up, down or sideways, then these videos popping up right here on your screen are definitely for you to watch
the video in the top left is a full trading tutorial video, and in the bottom left is a video showing you how to earn passive income on your crypto
i really hope you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next video
so will this bitcoin bounce last? uh, is it a fake bounce, or is this the real capitulation? is it over? and are we ready to go back up? that's what we're going to have a look at today
so let's get straight into the chart, starting on a macro chart over here
for those of you who have been watching, i did say that i was throwing all my bids in in this yellow box territory, in this zone over here, uh, which was price was caught between twenty one thousand seven hundred and thirty thousand dollars
so i laid all my bids there, and i got filled on about half of them
and make sure that you follow me on twitter, you'll see the reasons why i've given the seven steps the it's in the description over there
but i'll talk you through my thinking of exactly what i'm looking at over here
and first i'll just also start off by saying that this lower target of 21 000 is not necessarily voided
and i'm just mitigating my risk by closing my profitable positions
uh, also, one more thing, for those of you that have been asking a whole lot about which altcoins i got into
so there were five altcoins, and i'll tell you very quickly, the reason why i didn't give those is because i know people will struggle to control their risk and think it's the next best and biggest thing, and they'll go very heavy into those old coins
and if the trade goes against them, they end up getting wrecked
so i typically chart bitcoin, even though i take positions in alt queens
uh, remember the whole market, it's, it's a rising tide will lift all ships
when bitcoin dumps, bitcoin will dump, altcoins will dump harder
but the, for those of you curious, i took positions in matic apecoin, phantom, stargate, roon and super farm
super farm, i think i threw in as a sixth one because i saw it was still heavily knocked so great profits banked over there
so, um, quickly, looking at traditional markets over here, with the s p 500 and the nasdaq and all of that, you can see we lost those key quarterly levels
it's quite worrisome, actually, because it's different to covert, where you just had a straight dump, you made a low low, but then you just went straight back up and made low high
so you had your highs, you made a low low, lower high, next low low
so this is eventually going to snap back, probably make another low high
this is obviously affecting the entire market, but you're looking at targeting these key quarterly levels before any bounces
so the traditional markets could still come down a bit, another four percent, you can imagine, for crypto
and ultimately, i'd be targeting the covert area of that covert breakdown
from a technical perspective, looks like the best zone quantitative tightening is also coming up in june, and i think that will have an effect on the market
so this might if this week closes like this, that's extremely powerful
it's going to close above that key resistance area, which is flipping a support at 10376
you can see that with the rsi, it is in the extended area at the moment
so any sort of a turnover from that could give some relief to the crypto market
we can see that we wicked off of the, uh, 200 ma, the white 200 ma
but if this candle closes like this, uh, the the bulls do have a chance over here this
this is sort of how capitulation would look, especially if this can close much higher up and you leave a massive week behind, then you can start to look at that sort of vshape recovery
but when we go into the lower time frames now you'll see there are key areas that need to be taken out
the four day chart over here, uh, we almost week down into that main demand area over here
but you can see, overall, for longterm investors, this would be telling you to still stay out of the market
you're coming back up to that area that was previously a support area
and this is essentially how i made my decision to take the profits
it comes down to the fourhour chart that i've been using for so long
and what i mean by that is this, if this, if price deviates above and comes back down, that means that this area could now be flipped into a resistance zone
and if that flips into resistance, that's not going to be good
what typically happens after a big move down like this, an impulsive move, is you have that, uh, straight move back up to the upside
you can see bitcoin rallied from the lows to the highs, 22, let's round it up
and now you'll find that there can be some sort of a slowdown phase
so when it gets into this zone, it might range, it might come down, retest the mid level, so the the mid of that range, and this is probably without load back up again
so for those of you that want to know the exact price range, you're looking at thirty thousand dollars down to twenty five thousand dollars at the bottom of that week
i was dollar costs averaging on the way down, into both bitcoin and various altcoins, and targeting low prices
and if those orders get filled, there's that impulsive move back to the upside
now you can see the momentum oscillators are starting to turn back over
when you have price action like this after big moves down, there's going to be volatility
if i zoom out a bit, you can see we literally have just lower lows, lower lows, and this would now be your next series of lower highs
anywhere that price ends over here, below 40 000 is essentially still going to be a lower high
so you you got to be on low high watch, essentially, is what i'm saying
and i said that i was trading this as a mean reversion trader, is why it took the long and the smartest move to be doing right now would actually be looking for short positions from this area of resistance so your next zone to clear before i would target the upper levels
if price does manage to get above this green box, which is coming in at about thirty one thousand dollars
so let's say you manage to get break above, close back above thirty one thousand dollars with a couple of fourhour candles, then i would target the next green box, which is coming in at 35 000
i've outlined everything much clearer there because i have to keep these clips under 10 minutes long, so i can elaborate much more if you follow me on twitter
and until next time, i'll see you guys on the following video
so the bitcoin market and the crypto market as a whole, appears to be capitulating right before our eyes
we have price currently sitting at twenty eight thousand three hundred and fifty dollars
now, this will be a bit of a different show, because t a wise, we have laid out most of the main areas
but i first just wanna start off by saying that for the most part, most of the people in this type of environment are probably best not doing anything
if you've already hulled from wherever that may be, the 50s, the 60 000 zone within bitcoin, and your altcoins are down 80 95, well, there's really no point at the moment for you to sell
you're going to take an enormous loss, and it's probably not really worth it
there is a chance that bitcoin could have some sort of a reversal and push to the upside
so i'd encourage you to just remain patient and sit on your hands
for those of you that may have been wrecked, we did, uh, outline that this was most likely going to be very volatile times, which is what we're seeing at the moment
and i would imagine the rest of this week will continue that way
so whether that be to the up or the downside, i'm not really sure
and if you do have capital like i have, and you're willing to deploy that, then i also recommend not trying to pick a bottom, but coming with a plan in which you can deploy bit by bit, so dollar cost average slowly into the market
please make sure that you follow me on twitter, there will be a card that's going to pop up on the top of the screen or take you to my exact page
and i'm outlining every step that i make, every time i make a buy or every time i sell
i do let you guys know i'm planning on scaling in over the course of this week with anywhere between three and five percent of my trading capital my trading portfolio
that's not necessarily my entire net worth, it's just my trading portfolio
so i'm going to go very quickly through this because i did cover it on yesterday's video
we outlined that this yellow box territory, which has ranged between 20 and 30 000 zone, would be the main level to watch
now i'm not trying to pick a bottom, but if i had to pick a bottom, then, historically speaking, the 50 moving average on a monthly chart would be a good place to look
now it's definitely possible that price could go much lower than that
and from a macro perspective, it's possible that we come back there again, even if we bounce from here
so bear in mind that any trades that i'm taking at the moment are simply mean reversion trades as a swing trader
and i'll explain what i mean about that in a couple of minutes time
i'm basically bidding, uh, section by section as we go down towards that lower range
and i'm not going to be entering with any more than 50 percent of my trading capital
i am expecting some sort of a snapback at some point, and that's when i'll look to lay off some of those profits that i'm gonna make
it's going to prices that it hasn't been to in around 20 years
you can see it's forming almost like a cup and handle type of chart pattern over here
so if it's a deviation above and comes back down to form the handle, but bear in mind that that would still be very bullish for the long term
but if the dexi can top out somewhere along these levels pull back, then it can give us some breathing room to for those of you who may be stuck in the market to get out
and for those of you that are bidding like i am now, you can make some profits along the way
so moving on to this chart over here we have the weekly chart
and what do we see? on the weekly chart? you can see that price has come down as low as 25 500
so i see this all as an opportunity only for those that are in a position to place some bids
for the most part, many people should just be sitting on their hands and waiting all of this out
we'll see how the weekend price action goes, but possibly because the liquidity books are uh low
on the weekend, there's not that many, uh, institutions and things that are playing within the market, then that's kind of when you can see those massive weeks to the downside
so i don't necessarily believe that everything is over yet, so we'll take it step by step
now, moving on to this chart over here, we have our key quarterly zone which price is broken below the 28 500 level
and we need to see how is that going to close? is it going to close under there, or we're going to wick back up? if that does, that could be an indication that this was capitulation after all
the one day chart, you can see this over extension within price
we left our main range, which we identified on the previous time
but essentially i will be looking for a reversion back to the mean
i actually wanted to show you that with the reversion back to the mean, and how i would be trading it
so if we use the 21 weekly ema, you can see, i i told you guys before that when that is angled down and prices below it, that is incredibly bearish
it's an indication, most of the time, that it's a bear market
when you have a massive move to the downside, we're just setting lower lows and lower lows and lower lows
now, if you look at that as a percentage, that could be an enormous move
if it plays out like that, you're looking at 60 on bitcoin alone
some of the alt coins could do as much as about 100, move quite easily
and i'm definitely, again, not encouraging anybody to buy any alt coins
however, if the 21 ema is the mean of price, then you can expect when price deviates really far from that level, it should move back into that zone
so if we have a look over here, price was overextended from that about 48, and then it came back down
then price came down from that zone about 35, and then it pushed back up
and then this zone over here, we had an over extension around 50
so if you look from that level, you're looking also around 40 to 50 percent
i'm, i'm not betting on a longterm reversal or anything of that sort, just a reversion back to the mean
while we have the bare moon, as you know, uh, in i think three or four days time, we'll have the bull moon
on the fourhour chart, you have your main line that's tracking price down
i actually put it on to one hour because when you get to these extreme levels, i really want to zoom in and see how things are going
now i know price is broken through, so it's not a perfect fit, but i take the line that is of best fit where we have the most amount of touches
if it makes it to 30 000, which is now the range low, that's gonna probably flip from support into resistance
i would imagine that bears are going to most likely reload up on their shorts in these areas and target back towards the downside
there's not much else to say other than just to trade carefully

over the past few days, the crypto market has entered capitulation mode
ethereum has just fallen below 2k, and the terra ecosystem has fully collapsed after the failure of the lfg foundation to bring ust back to its peg
wednesday saw the uscpi data print for the month of april, and it confirmed that inflation continues to run hot and even beat the consensus of analysts
the analyst consensus for the cpi data in april was a headline print of 81 percent
this is not what the crypto market needed at this point in time
i myself was hopeful of a reading below consensus to perhaps spark a bit of support in the cryptocurrency market and us
but i do think that if you give yourself a long enough horizon, that you'll have some success into 2023 and 2024, and perhaps even into the back end of 2022
although it may seem like the crypto market is dead right now and is going to continue to die, the abundance of opportunity still exists, and i do think that it will be that way into the future
the market cycles of flushing out the overleveraged and the bad actors has happened over the last few days
and we've seen this in previous cycles, only for the crypto market to flourish in the longer term
however, the macro headwinds are blowing as hard as they ever have since the crypto market's inception in its short history
this time, the macro really does matter because of that institutional adoption in the crypto space
the 2020 and 2021 bull cycles saw mass institutional adoption of cryptocurrency markets
and these guys who are providing institutional money to the crypto markets are going to be paying attention to what's happening in the macro landscape
and at the moment, with inflation running hot and central banks tightening their monetary policy, it's going to make it very hard for them to justify allocating substantial risk to the cryptocurrency market
in previous cycles, institutional money was mostly not there, and instead it was retail players participating in these big pump and dumps that weren't really too impacted by what was going on with central banks and what was happening in the macro landscape
so taking into account that macro really matters, this time, the global landscape has very much shifted over the last 6 to 12 months, commencing in june 2022, the federal reserve is going to pull out up to 22 million dollars worth of liquidity from the us
whereas, comparing to back in may 2021, it was a quantitative easing process where the fed was still providing liquidity to the market
but this time around, in 2022, they're actually withdrawing liquidity from the markets
in times of a dip, the market needs to find liquidity for the next leg higher, or even to stabilize
and at the moment, that liquidity is being withdrawn from the market
and it won't be until we see the inflation data, like wednesday's cpi data, start to plateau consistently, that the fed can take their foot off of the tightening pedal and start to be more accommodative and provide liquidity to the market
at the moment, they're going through a process of withdrawing liquidity from the market
and that's going to make it very hard for equity markets and for crypto markets to recover in the short term
harping on about inflation, because that is the key to the federal reserve's mandate, stable prices
and obviously, over the last six to 12 months, and even a little bit longer than that, prices haven't been so stable
we've seen the price of assets increase a substantial amount, and the everyday spending by consumers is increasing at a rapid rate
and if the fed want to uphold their mandate, which is clearly the idea right now, they're going to do everything that they can to make sure that price stability is achieved in the short term and for the longer term
10year treasury yield moves higher, equities move lower, and vice versa
equities, they have a strong positive correlation with bitcoin and the crypto market
10 year yield to start to find a macro top, and for equities to find a bottom
treasury yield is finding some kind of resistance, while equities and crypto continue to move lower
nasdaq, the technology index, is in the orange line, and bitcoin is in the pink line
so we can expect to follow this correlation and find a top in us
yields will correlate with a bottom in bitcoin and a bottom in us
as inflation continues to run hot and beat the consensus of analysts, crypto is capitulating, and it often takes weeks and even months for reaccumulation to be had
as i mentioned earlier, if you think of what happened post may 2021, in an environment where the fed were providing liquidity to the market, it took weeks and months, up until july august, for the market to see a new leg higher
and this time, with liquidity being pulled from the market, it could probably take even longer, given that there's less liquidity to push the market in a sustained direction higher
so that paints a pretty bleak picture for crypto in the short term
for crypto to see a bottom, i think treasury yields need to see a macro top and fall back from resistance
equities and crypto, particularly bitcoin, is so strong, those two should move together in the case that us
and yields will peak when the market is content that inflation has topped and has plateaued out, consistently plateauing inflation data
at that point, they can start to be more accommodative in their stance
and the market will front run that as it sees the data come in month to month
but like i mentioned, it could take up to a quarter or even longer for that data to consistently show that inflation has peaked and that price stability is coming back into the market, upholding the fed's mandate
at the point where we see that inflationary data start to peak and plateau out, that would be, i think, a good time to start looking for longs on the blue chip crypto tokens, like solana, like bitcoin, like ethereum, and look forward to the next leg higher
but for now, personally, i'm sitting on my hands and trying to conserve capital as much as i can until that point does come around
what do you think about all of this and what's happening in the markets right now? i'll catch you on the next video
so it is a very, very tough day out there in the crypto sphere
and you can see over here, i have a chart of, of course, none other than luna
i personally did try and take along on this this morning, just a bit of gambling money, and i could see that it was gonna smash straight through the only area of support that i found, which was around six dollars, and i stopped out
and currently it's sitting at two dollars and 20 cents and continuing down
and i think there's a lot of people out there that are absolutely shattered in the current market environment
and i'm treating things a little bit different um, i definitely don't want to capitalize or take the opportunity of other people's pain
but from a market sentiment standpoint, the pain is too bad for me to ignore
and i have deployed five percent of my available trading capital
i've been 100 in stable coins, so i've deployed five percent into the market
and many people may wonder, well, why have i deployed five percent in when we're in a strong downtrend? remember, guys, i've planned for this
i told you that i'd be looking for certain zones and certain levels and prices now coming into that
so it's time that i step up and put my money away in my mouth
as i said i would enter at least some of my money in in anticipation of a, at least a dead cat bounce, at a minimum
although, of course, with luna, that's something a little bit more unique, something i haven't seen before
there will be some sort of an impulsive move where you can play the reversal
i don't know where the bottom will be, but i know that it's somewhere most likely in this region
uh, you can see that price is currently sitting at thirty one thousand five hundred and fifty two dollars
into the yellow box territory, which is, uh, anywhere around here would be my buy zones
i would expect a bounce from we still haven't tagged that level yet, but going down onto the worst case scenario zones would be about 21 276
and that meets with that 50 moving average on a monthly scale, which is currently trending up
so obviously, you can imagine, as each month continues on, you can move that price target up
but anyway, in the zone is good value for money, and i think a lower risk to reward, at least to play a bounce
um, on a weekly you can see strong downtrend, but very, very similar
we're in that yellow box territory, so looking at the next moving average that's coming up over there, 27 000, and then another one at 22 000
all right, looking at this chart over here, again, you've got your key quarterly levels, or your range lows
you have the macd still crossed down and picking up momentum to the downside
again, i want to put emphasis on, i'm just trading the impulsive move when things do get oversold
uh, you can at least look to catch a little bit of a bounce, right? i mean, you, you can take the decision after that if you want to use that profit and readd it lower, if you just want to let it ride and see how far it goes up
let's just move that down to the daily where we broke the range
i would imagine if it does make it as high as thirty four thousand dollars, then we'll see what happens over here
is going to flip that previous area of support that we had all those times over the past year into a new resistance level? uh? so i'm keeping an eye out for that
so i'll be looking to scale in at least a portion of my portfolio in this zone over here over the next couple of days
you can see on the fourhour chart that it is attempting to hold this trend line
i mean, not really many touch points on a fourhour chart, but yeah, at the range lows around thirty thousand dollars
and if cpi data, which comes out today, is positive, if it's anything that was expected or better than expected, i would anticipate that the market would rally off of that
you can see that what's been going on with luna has been affecting the rest of the market
people are panicking in case it has some sort of a knockon effect, right? so, uh, you wonder how many d5 projects out there had their reserves in anchor, for example, and now they're panicking
what are they going to do with the ust and the anchor reserves? do they have to pull that out? it's causing absolute pandemonium
if the dexi rejects from this level, which so far it is looking like it's doing on a weekly chart, as long as you can close your weekly candles below that 10376 zone, then that gives bitcoin and crypto some glimmer of hope
so, uh, very tough to to trade in this type of environment, when you start to go into this peak fear and panic, but it does provide maximum opportunity
if you go on my twitter, you'll see that i mentioned, uh, i'll put a link for that, by the way
but i mentioned over here, i said that in times of maximum psychological pain and exhaustion, you need maximum psychological focus
and the point of max opportunity is when people are most beaten up
and that's exactly what you're seeing in the market right now
people are not even talking about the cpi results, which are coming out today, which is usually a very, very big topic
so i would say that this is the time that you really want to remain focused, keep your eyes on the chart, and don't lose focus of your plan
um, other than me just having deployed five percent of my trading capital

if you want to follow me on twitter, i'll keep you updated there
hey, what's up guys? it's matt, and i'm back with another daily bitcoin update video
so let's talk about what recently happened and what you can expect over the next upcoming days, especially ever since bitcoin dropped down so significantly within the past week
so before i continue, as always, drop a like and subscribe, if you're new, in order to get future crypto updates just like this
and you can check the links down in the description if you want to join my public trading community or my private community for additional trading guidance as well
now, if we take a look at bitcoin, then we can see how drastic this drop has been over the past few days, where we have fallen over 25 within just a short period of time
so the crypto market in itself is quite volatile in general, so something like this isn't completely out of the ordinary
but with bitcoin, which is obviously the largest uh cryptocurrency based on its overall market cap, a 20 or 25 drop is pretty significant
and we have to keep in mind that we did break out of this weekly range that we have been trading in for a couple of months
and we also broke below the lows, so the low of january 24th, this was a significant annual low, and the low of february 24th as well
right? so now that the market structure is broken, and we also had this large bearish candle that closed outside of this large weekly range
in that range, as a reminder, stretches roughly between 34k and 44 or 45k
now the market structure is broken, and we're more likely to continue pushing lower
but one thing that we have to keep in mind of, and that's where, if i go on to the weekly chart, looking to the left, we need to pay attention to the fact that there is most likely a ton of liquidity that is residing below the lows of mid 2021, so below 28 and a half thousand, or, let's actually say, 287 thousand dollars
however, this doesn't necessarily mean that there is an absolute guarantee that we will push into these lows
so we have to remind ourselves that these are levels where, during mid2021, so last summer, this acted as a major support level
so let's recall how strong the bull market of last year was and how these lows were formed, where we had multiple attempts in order to break below these levels and to push bitcoin back into 25 000 or lower, and it failed
so anyone who believes that we're just going to slice right through this major support level is most likely going to be incorrect
now that doesn't mean that we can't push lower, but what it does mean is that we should expect at least a pause and some type of, some type of minimal range on the daily chart, um, where there's going to be some hesitation, where the bulls are now challenging the bears, right? so the bears came in
if i bring up the volume, we can see how large of an increase we had in the overall bearish volume, of course, compared to the bullish form volume
and the momentum is pretty strong too, right? so we did have a very moderate bearish trend a couple of days ago
so looking at the data from from, uh, the month of april, we can see that this is a trend that's slightly slanted about 45 degrees
and now it has changed into a strong, impulsive bearish move, right? so due to the fact that we're more vertical now, this shows a strength in the overall momentum, especially due to the fact that we finally broke out of this range
okay, so what can we expect over the next upcoming days? well, personally speaking, if i look onto the fourhour chart, we can get some more data here
as i discussed the the region that's at around 29 000 up to 30 000, is a major daily support zone, um
and so i would expect that the price action continues to fluctuate some somewhere within this daily range
so now this range is roughly two or two and a half thousand dollars um extended
so i would expect for the price action to retrace one more time back into the up upper portion of this range
now this doesn't mean that we are simply going to push back to this recent low
so we could have a small bear trap where we form a lower low, and then a quick spike up once again
so this would be a minor liquidity grab and then a continuation inside of this range
but again, this is what i most likely am expecting to occur, especially since we are quite over extended over the past couple of days
so just looking at the rsi, let's recall that we did have a sign of divergence while we were trading inside of this bearish channel from a couple of days ago
but this failed once the price action broke out of this bearish channel
and now we've been trading significantly below the 30 level on the rsi
but that doesn't mean that we still can't continue pushing lower
so let's not, don't confuse the rsi as a guaranteed signal that you're necessarily going to reverse all the way up
this is simply a momentum indicator that shows us how strong the bearish momentum is
but if we do see a sign on the four hour, or even on the two hour, where the price action continually is forming lower lows around this range, whereas the rsi is starting to form higher lows, which potentially could occur right now as we're forming this low
so let's say we get a spike down below this hourly range, close back up, whereas the rsi continually forms higher loads
so so that's where i'd be expecting a push back up to 32 000, so inside of this hourly range, or a bit higher

so thanks for watching, and i'll speak to you in the next video
so was that the bottom? is that the bitcoin bottom? or is there more pain ahead? let's take a closer look at the charts and we'll see what we can find out
so first and foremost, i'm starting off on the high time frame chart over here, which is the monthly chart
now, what you'll find is that a lot of people may start referring to capitulation
and why is that capitulation? well, i'm not so sure there was capitulation
if you go back simply just to the previous cycle highs that we had, and when price started to sell off, that came in in may 2021, many of you are probably around for that, what you'll find, in that one month period alone, price sold off a massive 48, so almost 50
and if you look at current price action over here, it's currently come down about 25
it could be enough to reverse the market, especially since we have reached near key levels
but i definitely wouldn't be betting on it, which is why i would exercise risk management if i was entering into the market
i've let you know on my twitter, which you can find in the description over there
and areas that i'm looking to scale in would be anywhere within this yellow box territory
now, where exactly is this yellow box territory? well, it starts as low as twenty thousand one hundred
i could probably move that up a bit, i would say, probably from about twenty one thousand dollars, uh, to current levels
now, price may return back down into this weak level, and even come down to the 28 500 level
the reason i decide to enter into or scale in, is because if the market does dip down to that level, and then it starts to take off after that, at least i have some exposure, right? so if you see something like this and the market takes off from there, at least you do have some exposure to the market, and you don't get left behind
so when you have rapid selloffs like this, and you can get a little bit entered into the market on a reversal candle, you can find yourself making a lot of money very quickly
now, that doesn't necessarily change where we are in a macro environment
in a macro environment, things do look good look really bad, which i have mentioned on previous shows
overall, this is a bear market, let's just call it what it is
doesn't mean that there won't be massive bounces along the way, which is what you should be looking out for
so to identify those bounces, we need to go into lower time frames first
you can see that the macd is still crossed to the downside and is gaining strength or momentum
you have your key quarterly range low levels, which, uh, price bounce just before that
however, is it going to be enough to hold the market up in the long run? and the reason why i say that is the market has tested that area multiple times over the last, call it, year and a half
so the more times that you knock on a certain area of support, the more likely it is to eventually break down
so it is an area where you need to be careful and exercise risk management
however, i did say on yesterday's video that any anywhere along these levels here, these zones, i would be looking to place bids and try and gain some entries for quick bounces
it doesn't matter which altcoin it is, because i know a lot of you will ask
i saw astro port went up something like 54 already off of this bounce
price below short term, below midterm, below long term moving averages
and that's signaling to be fully exited out of the market, if you're an investor
price has entered into that liquidity zone, which is why you might see some sharp bounces and reactions over here
you can expect volatility, definitely over the next couple of days
the next area, if this level gets lost, i would expect some, uh, sort of interest at the 24 000 level
you can imagine, guys, though, if we start closing under 30 000, that's where the real panic will set in
so i know a lot of people have been absolutely wrecked, uh, already as it is, and i'm really sorry about that
stay strong, and just know that, you know, there is more to life than trading, and you can fight your way out of it
i've been asked by a lot of people, should you be selling now? probably not
and at the very least we should get a sharp reaction to the upside, which will just be a bounce, though, at the very minimum, there should be a bounce
we said that price closed outside of that range, and that was bad, right? we don't want to see price close outside of this range
but what this is telling me now is that price has essentially lost this predominant range, and therefore is more than likely going to go down further
now in this tile, i said, was that the bottom? well, it could be a local bottom, but is it the macro bottom? i'm not so sure about that
and the reason why i say that is, if you know your candlestick, and that's me again, you'll know, very similar to the monthly chart, which i pointed out, i said, when a chart, when a candle closes like that as a full body red candle, the probability is that the next candle will also turn red
it's unlikely that you're just going to reverse straight from a full body red candle
this is a shortterm bounce, and who knows, maybe it will close green
but more than likely, it's going to retest these lows and possibly even break that down
so be cognizant of that, that any sort of longs that you are taking now are high risk
so you have your next moon, come moon phase, that's coming in over here on the 17th of may
so similar to the last bull moon, that does not necessarily mean it's going to reverse the entire market, but it could provide a little bit of momentum for shortterm bounce
now, now, the reason that the moons work is they affect people's moods, right? it's just a simple psychological phenomena
if there's a bare moon, then it means that people are obviously feeling more pessimistic and negative
and when the bull moon arrives, somehow that has an effect on people's emotions where they feel more optimistic and willing to take risk
you can see momentum oscillators are attempting to cross back to the upside
however, how far can this go? well, the furthest that i see this bounce going would be towards the green box territory, which is coming in at about, uh, 34 900 lectures rounded up and call it the 35 000 level
so this was the area that we were hoping there would be a bounce from previously
so i would, i would assume that it could pull back towards that area
if i wanted to be really conservative, looking for a potential bounce, i would say, let's just grab this over here, at least to the bottom over there, which is at 34 200
if you're looking to long this, it's a high risk long, because this price could easily turn back over, come back down and lose those range lows at 30 000
but if it does make it to the upside, you're looking at another eight percent from here
i did enter on my altcoin when we hit near the bottom over here in the early hours of this morning, so my risk is clearly defined
and if you are looking to take any longs, you should definitely be cognizant of that, define your risk and know where you would exit the market
uh, ultimately, risk does remain to the downside in the long term
but that doesn't mean that there won't be bounces along the way
as i've mentioned, you can make a lot of money on those bounces
but you have to, have to, have to exercise risk management when it comes to trading you really want to survive in this game
if you wreck your account once, if you have a major account and you lose that entire account, you'll probably never trade ever again
also hit the bell notification if you want to be notified of the next, uh, upcoming video
is the worst over for bitcoin and the crypto market, or has the selling just begun? well let's have a look at the charts and take a closer look at what may be happening today and for the rest of the week
well, first and foremost, i'm going to start off over here with the monthly chart
it doesn't matter which time frame i've gone, it's not looking good
so the low that we had earlier on this year, in january, at thirty two thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars, has officially been breached
so price is oscillating just above, just below that trend line over there
the next major level of support that you're looking at on a monthly chart is going to be 28 and eighty 581 dollars, which is coming in at this zone over here
i would expect that there would be some bidding that goes on over there, and people will attempt to catch the dip the next zone after that, you're looking at is that your 50 moving average, which is currently coming in at twenty one thousand two hundred dollars, and it is rising as each week continues on
you lose that level, and your next zone is going to be the nineteen thousand six hundred and sixty six dollar zone
we will just cross each road as it comes so if we, if we lose the 28 5k level, then we'll find our next area of interest
i said, what is the lowest price that you believe bitcoin will reach, uh, before reversing back to the upside? i posted the options at thirty thousand, twenty eight thousand, twenty four thousand, sixteen thousand or less
the majority of people have voted between the twenty four and thirty thousand dollar level
so you can see the market sentiment is eventually starting to change, where people are looking for lower prices
and you have 10 that are looking at less than 16 000 per bitcoin
now i said over the weekend, also on my twitter, that i'm looking for a very specific change in sentiment
i'll be looking for more than 80 of market participants to be looking for much lower prices before any sign of a reversal
and on top of that, they'll start to talk about the cme gap that's coming in
once you have the majority of the market fixated on those prices, then have a look for how price reacts at the areas of support
and i've outlaid my strategy of how i plan on playing the market over the next couple of days
it looks like it's got about possibly another 20 to go before there's any sort of a bounce over there
i said, let's watch this candle very, very closely, because as long as the taxi continues to rally, so the dollar index, then risk on assets are going to have a really, really tough time
now the biggest hope for the bulls is that we failed to close any weekly candles above this area, which is at 103761
so if bulls can keep the dexi below that level, and there's some sort of a pullback from here, it may give the crypto market a chance to bounce
but until then, we will continue to have a hard time, and bears will remain entirely in control
so going on to the next chart over here, you have your weekly chart with your weekly 21 ema
i would also be using this chart to target the next level, which is the key quarterly lows, coming in at 28 thousand eight hundred and ninety eight dollars
the only problem is the more times that you knock on a certain area of support, the more likely it is to eventually break through
so we're going to be coming in for another test, which is one, two, three, four, five
however, i want to also have you be cognizant on this trend line over here, so or this ema, at least the exponential moving average, you get what's called mean reversion traders
now mean reversion trader will say that price always tends to revert back to the mean
so when you over extended, you should be selling, because price will pull back to the mean
when you oversold, you should be buying, because price can pull back to the mean
so i would be looking, i would be looking at this almost as a mean reversion trader, and i'd be definitely willing to place some bids at the 28 29 dollar level for a couple of reasons
the other reason is how look how far extend that is from that weekly 21 ema price
and as a mean reversion strategy, i would think that a pull back that far from this would at least lead to some sort of a bounce
maybe not all the way back, but at least somewhere within that region
and if you have been following me for a couple of weeks, and you listen to what i said, you should be in a wonderful position now where you have the opportunity to get a lot of cryptos at much, much lower prices
that's actually people would usually be shorting the market in this type of environment
it's saying, long term, that crypto is in trouble, and you should probably be out of the market
as you can see, we lost the yearly, the previous yearly low, which is this week over here
so remain cautious and careful with any bids that you may be placing
all right, when you have a look at this chart over here, this is the four hour chart
although the momentum oscillators are extended to the downside, they can remain there longer than what you think
so i would recommend not thinking, just because at the bottom that it's simply a buy
and if you have a look, we're only about eight percent away from the range low
i don't know if that is going to happen, but all that i do know is that you have your low high, your low low, then your low high, your next lower low, and another lower low that's currently being set now
so there will be an impulsive move which will be traded in two kind of kinds of ways
i don't know how far down this will go, but there will be an impulsive move
if you do manage to buy a bottom, then great, you can get a decent move off of that
so anybody that's been caught off guard with a salof now, when there is that mean reversion or the bounce like that, they're most likely going to be planning on taking off of the table
there's a chance that this is going to take longer than we think
there's a chance that the market may continue to sell off like this for a number of months
when market structure is damaged like this, it doesn't just return overnight
all i know is that i identified that the trend was down, and i sold on into that
let's rather stay out of the market until the trend changes back up
uh? however, when it gets over extended, like it is now, there are opportunities where you can allocate small portions of your cash portfolio into the market to catch those balances
you can make, uh, very, very good returns in that type of an environment

it's matt, and this video is going to be another bitcoin update
so we'll be discussing the recent crash where bitcoin dropped down over 10 within a couple of hours, and much more related to its market structure
so as always, drop a like and subscribe if you enjoy this content
and of course, check out the links in the description if you'd like to join my public trading community, or if you'd like additional trading guidance as well
so if we recall what i discussed in the last update, i was eyeing the fact that the price action still did not give us a significant close underneath this price point of roughly thirty eight thousand or thirty seven and a half thousand
so i was looking at this region as simply representing a major, uh, daily support zone, okay? and so when it comes to the market structure, you might get a lower low or a higher high, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the market structure can remain broken
so in this case, uh, we did get this spike recently here, on may 1st, so just a few days ago, but then the price pushed back up, and then it dropped once again
so i discussed this in the last update, where the rsi was creating higher lows, whereas the price action was forming lower lows
so this is where the price action, after being quite overextended and attempting to break outside of, uh, this support zone, it failed
and so this is where we got the rally back up into the upper portion of this downwards bearish channel
okay, so i discussed the likelihood that we can push up to around 40 000, and then if we reject this, we can drop down
and at this point, due to the fact that we did have this strong hourly bearish, impulsive move
and if we look at the daily, we also had this strong bearish daily candle that closed below the support zone
at this point, the market structure is more than likely going to remain bearish
in addition to that, let's recall this price imbalance that i was discussing for a couple of weeks now, which is down here at around 36 and a half thousand dollars
so if i extend uh and connect to this entire impulsive move that we previously had, we did have a minor price imbalance that was at around, again, 36 and a half thousand dollars
and so as far as right now, this has been taken care of because this region has been mitigated
and in addition to that, we also broke out of this upwards channel, which, if we think about it, once things start to become way too obvious in the market
you can expect some type of sweep or liquidity to grab, especially once a ton of people see a certain pattern play out
this is why, instead of this bullish channel, we can also look at this as simply representing a large weekly range that stretches across uh, roughly between 45 000 down to 35 000
or you can extend it by a couple hundred dollars, but this would simply represent a ten thousand dollar range at this point
and so now the question remains, well, where are we likely to go next? well, this is where, of course, the price action, as we can see, on a lower time frame
and so it looks as though we're going to drop further back down
but markets do tend to move in waves, meaning that we're likely going to get a correction back up to the upper portion of this range or above it, in order to gather up more liquidity before the next push down
okay, so this is typically how the market structure works, where if you're pushing down, you'll have a and a distribution cycle followed by a potential redistribution cycle
and we don't know how long it's going to remain in this hourly range
however, one region that i would be looking for for the price action to retrace back into is into the bottom of this bearish channel that we just broke out of, right? so this would be around 368 up to 37 000
because if we think about this, let's go back to the daily chart
if we just broke out of this daily support zone, right? because we were technically trapped inside of this bearish channel
or you could look at this as a daily range, since we were trapped inside of this for a few weeks, now that we finally broke out of it and got this strong bearish close, the price action will remain broken
and as long as we hold below this, uh, range that we're previously previously trading inside of, the next logical region to to push into is to push down
okay? so we need to think about this as simply representing a potential break and retest, or the price action corrects a little bit, since all the sellers, i'm sure, have jumped in right now
and then we can see a continuation of this overall bearish trend
there's still a chance that, as bearish as this looks, due to the fact that we did fill the price and balance back here from february 24th, there's still the chance that if we do break out of this range, and let's say we don't reject these prices at around like i discussed, 368 or 37 000, so let's say it pushes up and holds above these prices and continues pushing higher, so back into, uh, 364 thousand dollars
and at this point it would be back inside of this previous bearish channel
well, then at that point we can claim that this would simply represent a large liquidity grab and that the price action will simply continue fluctuating inside of this large weekly range
okay? so we have to keep in mind that this is a possibility where the price action can simply push back inside of this bearish channel and continue ranging from that point on
so everyone is reacting a bit due to the fact that crypto crashed, and the stock market has crashed a bit as well
so everything is down, and so everyone is reacting impulsively
but as i discussed, as long as we hold below this bearish channel, the next region that we're likely going to push into is further down below this hourly range
so at this point, i would be eyeing the bottom of this range, which would represent 35 000 and potentially lower
and i understand this is not something that everyone wants to hear, but this is simply the reality of the markets where we need to react to what is being presented to us
so as far as right now, because of the fact that the momentum remains bearish, we have to be open to the fact that this bearish daily trend could simply continue pushing lower, where we sweep these lows that were formed back here during february and january of this year
okay, so that would push the price, uh, if we break below 35 000, which i've marked again as the bottom of this weekly range, that we're definitely going to push a lot lower, a lot further back down
and then at that point, a key region that we need to pay attention to are these lows at around 29 000 or 30 000
because these lows would simply represent a region where liquidity would be residing in the market, based on the fact that a ton of traders probably have their stop losses set here
and in addition to to the fact that you would also have traders looking to buy the breakout once the price action pushes below these lows
and these levels have been held up ever since january of 2021
so it's been over a year and a half of a long and grueling range
and so if we do push down below 34 000, i would be eyeing for these prices next, because this is the region, aside from these previous lows that were formed during january and february of this year, this is the next logical region where a ton of liquidity would be residing
and so of course, if you're a shortterm trader, you can look to take some shortterm cells
but if you're a longterm holder and you're simply looking to continually dollar cost average into bitcoin and buy it up, well, then this can present you itself as good longterm buying opportunities where you're simply buying at a discount
and so this is not something that, again, everyone wants to think about
but think about the fact that a couple of months ago, bitcoin was trading above 60 000
but if you haven't bought this um or you're simply looking to add to your portfolio, well, then now it's in the low 30 thousands
and if it drops below these lows, well, then it's below 30 000 again
so you have to look at this from some optimistic standpoint, even if this does mean that this turns into a an extended bearish cycle
if you think that we're going to break below 34 000 and sweep these lows and potentially drop below 30k, let me know if you think that or not

so the much anticipated fomc meeting is finally out of the way, and results came in as expected, at 50 basis points
when questioned to jerome powell if that would be on the table, has officially been taken off
so he said it's very, very unlikely that there would be 75 basis point rate hike in 2022
so overall, the meeting was quite, uh, dovish, which was good for the bulls
and consequently, we got a nice push from bitcoin and a couple of the altcoins
it moved, uh, from bottom to top, just over five percent on bitcoin alone
and uh, i guess everybody's wondering, what now? what's next? what's the next big move? have bulls done enough to redeem themselves and take full control of the market? well, let's take a closer look
so if you remember from yesterday's show, i did mention that the main level to clear was going to be this zone over here
but is there a glimmer of hope? well, let's start on the high time frame, and we'll work our way down
so first and foremost, i did mention that the bulls are working on first, second and third set of higher lows
we just need to see if they can get back above these levels and clear the previous week's height, 41 000
until then, i still would remain very, very cautiously optimistic
but i will be very, very quick to flip my bias bullish and jump straight back in the market if the market shows the opportunity to do so
so let's not talk about down levels at the bottom and areas to catch a falling knife, because it's not really on the table or relevant today
let's just take the market as it comes and we'll go step by step
and hopefully, if this we can close, uh, bullish, then it will have a chance to start working back towards those green candles, which will be a good thing
until then, again, remember, for longterm investors, you really want to be following this yellow trend line or this yellow moving average at least, which is the 21 exponential moving average, which has been governing price quite nicely, holding below, tried to get back above, fall back down
so if bulls do take control, i'd love to see how they react to that area
also noteworthy, as it's still going to be coming up into a major area of resistance between 43 and 46 000
so that's more for the longer term investors that are at looking at price action over months to years
you have your 200 moving average, which we know has also historically worked very well for gauging price in buu and bear markets
prices stuck below, we really want to see, as a bull, you want this price to get back above and start closing three day candles above that area
once that happens, we can start working on targeting the top of the range
the next chart that i have over here is essentially a range that i've drawn
you have the main range, which is, on the extreme ends, is coming in between thirty four thousand dollars on the low end, and coming up to the top of the range, you have forty eight thousand dollars, four hundred
so we've essentially been stuck in this massive range for the entire year, just chopping in and out, in and out
and the tighter side of the range is between thirty seven thousand dollars and forty five thousand dollars
so, i mean, this is most likely just going to continue onwards
when will we eventually get the next massive, major move from crypto? well, very hard to tell
there are a lot of potential catalysts, one of which that i've marked with this vertical line, is coming in june
but that's where the fed have basically said that they're going to start with their quantitative tightening
so the same way that the massive bull run began in 2020, when they started with quantitative easing, and they printed trillions of dollars worth of stimulus into the economy
and we'll have to see how price reacts once it gets to this zone
so it's been very difficult to make money in this market for range, for uh, trend traders
this is the main way that a range trader would make money, is essentially just having a look at how price reacts when coming to the bottom of the range, simply buying, trying to target back towards the top of the range, and then selling at the top and waiting back for the bottom
so the question is, will we get another test back down to the 34 000 region? and if so, how strong is that support? is it something that's going to hold? well, we'll just have to wait and see
for now, you have this diagonal which is giving the bulls a glimmer of hope
and not not just on bitcoin, but a lot of altcoins, you'll find, if you track this down, they had that candle that broke them out of that area
so what you want to be doing is having a looking at how, have a look at how price reacts in that zone
if you see the retest of that as and it flips it as support, and price can start to get back above and then, more importantly, get above that forty one thousand dollar region, come back down, test that as support
then you can possibly target the next area of the top of that range, or possibly the highest area of that range, which is coming in at forty seven thousand, forty eight thousand dollars
but when you're looking at the high time frames, remember there is a lot of resistance up there, and risk continues to remain to the downside
i also started using the super guppy, which is a whole bunch of, uh, moving averages that are combined together
it works very well on the daily and i have used it previously
essentially, when you have the band gray and turned back into green, that's been an area where you start to initiate a bull run
so zoom far out, you can see as well, guys, you got that range over there, which is from last year in june, which was the bottom of the range
so the bullish scenario would be if we're repeating something like this, and we can start to get back above these levels and create the next part of the bull run
so what you want to see is you want to see those gray areas tighten like that, and then slowly start to turn green
essentially, like if you followed this system, it would have taken you out in the 50 000 region, which i believe is better than what most people sold at
so what do we currently have now? you had that turn gray, go red, pull price back down, try to turn back up, go gray
uh? so at the top of that range, and now it's gone back down again
so we'll just have to monitor that, see how that works out over the next couple of months
now, moving on to the lowest time frame that i use, which is the four hour, you can see that momentum oscillators are starting to cross back down again
so you can expect there will most likely be a slight pullback after yesterday's pump, which is always expected
we still need to clear above those previous lower highs to form the next series of higher highs
now there is a possibility that if you want to be a really, really aggressive trader, you can give it the benefit of the doubt and say, well, that is your next higher low relative to this zone over here
so after your next higher low, you're still waiting for the next higher high
if it retests in this zone, then possibly that could be your next area to load up on
and again, i just want to caution you, this is for really aggressive traders
most people don't have any real reason to be in this type of market
but otherwise, you'd be looking to potentially buy on the retest of this trendline, which is coming in at 39 000
and then maybe on the next attempt, you can push through this box, set in the next higher high, and then a new trend will start to begin

there will be a card that will pop up on the top of the screen
and that was a little bit of a snooze fest, with jerome powell and the fomc delivering exactly what the market had anticipated
equities, both moving higher on the announcement and into the press conference, where jerome powell reassured the market that there was not going to be 75 basis point hikes at any of the meetings for the rest of the year
bitcoin moved off of its lows by about five percent on the day
dollar topped out and moved lower, and that helped boy risk sentiment across markets on wednesday
but the question is now, how long is this rally going to last? and how far can bitcoin move before facing more headwinds? going into wednesday's meeting, the market had fully priced in a 50 basis point hike for the fomc announcement that was at 6 pm utc
if you watched my video earlier on in the week, we were speaking about a sell the rumor and by the news type of event playing out at 6 pm
but i warned that the main event would be the press conference, which was to come half an hour later at 6 30 pm utc
the risk leading into the press conference was that jerome powell would entertain the idea when asked about a 75 basis point hike, which would be a triple rate hike based on a traditional 25 basis point hike
and that was the overwhelming factor that could have sent risk markets, bitcoin equities down into the gutter
and jerome powell reassured the market that there was going to be no 75 basis point hikes, and that they were off the table for the rest of 2022
and that helped boy risk sentiment and crypto and equities moved higher
and effectively, jerome powell is going to force the market to price in 50 basis point hikes for both the june and the july meetings, now that he communicated that essentially to the markets very, very plainly
you know, at the press conference, he was very clear that 75 basis points was off the table, and that they would remain to hike by 50 basis points into the coming meetings
now, short term, all of this could force bitcoin to push higher into 41 or 42k and ethereum could see as high as 3100
equities and the s p 500 and the nasdaq could move a little bit higher as well
but the very important thing that came out of the wednesday fomc meeting was that the fed are going to start quantitative tightening in june 2022, and that will continue on until they see progress on inflation
they said that they'll reduce its balance sheet by 475 billion per month in june, july and august, and then ramp it up to about 95 billion in september and onwards
and that will force downside pressure on the markets, i think, over the longer term
but short term, this reaction to the fmc meeting still has a little bit to play out
i think the reduction of liquidity in the market that comes from quantitative tightening and rolling off the fed's balance sheet, enforced by the federal reserve over the next few months is going to make it hard for risk assets to run higher
as liquidity is withdrawn from the market and the federal reserve builds up its reserves of us
and overall, that will shift a risk off tone onto the market over the coming months
but any higher than that at the moment is hard to justify, in my opinion
looking at a chart visualizing the fed's balance sheet and its relation to bitcoin price, you can see that ever since the massive expansion of quantitative easing, where the fed balance sheet grew, they were pumping liquidity into the market, bitcoin has risen sharply as a result of that increased liquidity available in the market
and quantitative tightening is going to have a an effect on the fed's balance sheet where it starts to decline
you can see here on the chart, in the orange line, that the fed's balance sheet has been steadily increasing where they have been carrying out quantitative easing
so more liquidity in the market from here, and then bitcoin follows suit
but when they start to withdraw liquidity from the market, their balance sheet is going to decrease in value
they are going to have more cash in their reserves for a rainy day when the economy isn't as strong
so what impact is quantitative tightening going to have on bitcoin? well, knowing the relationship between this orange line and the blue line, as the fed balance sheet moves higher, so it does to bitcoin
but as the fed balance sheet starts to move off, which is starting to happen in june this year, and accelerating into september, into year end, we could see bitcoin start to decline in value as well
if this relationship remains consistent, and i think it's very highly likely that that relationship holds true, less liquidity available in the market as a result of quantitative tightening, and bitcoin should start to fall lower

bitcoin has pushed up over three percent in the last 16 hours, and alt queens are absolutely exploding
on today's crypto short we can have a look at the charts to see whether now is the time to flip long and if so, at what level should that be? so let's get into it all right
but you'll notice that the diagonal trend line over here, which came in at 37 500, once again acted as a support area, and price managed to bounce from there
but when we look at the greater picture, what exactly does this mean? where did these longs come from? well, to see that, i've gone to the binance futures trading platform to see exactly what's going on with the leveraged traders
and the ratio currently is sitting at 355 long to short, meaning that 78 of market participants have gone long and 21, 21 to 22, are currently shorting the market
so when you zoom up to the top over here, you'll find that the open interest levels have also increased
what does this exactly mean? well, it could have a potential to reverse the market and go back into an uptrend
but in order to do that, there's certain levels that need to be cleared
however, when in a downtrending market you see open interest levels rise, this is usually a sign that a low high will most likely be set in
well, on the previous show, i showed that this area was of importance, and that is the previous week's week high, which comes in at, let's just round it up to 41 000 for the sake of round numbers
if you are looking for the precise level, it's forty thousand eight hundred
i'd want to see price get above there and start to close weekly candles in that region before, as an investor would start to become, uh, bullish
in the long term, bear in mind, you do have those, uh, moving averages that are coming in as well, which are also going to mark resistance levels
so those ones were support are now going to flip into resistance
something good that you do have going on for the bulls right now is you have this level over here, which is coming in at 36 000, that is holding as a higher low
you have your next series of high lows with a couple of weekly candles closed over there at 37 700
and if if we manage to start pushing price up very quickly from this level, that could be a great thing
once you start to clear this, uh, that could start to show that we have three zones that i have now cleared as higher lows on a weekly that's high time frame stuff, which can be good for the long term
not only that, that gives the bulls a chance to start to form an ascending triangle pattern, which is also a reaccumulation pattern
when you see a ascending triangle break out to the upside, which it has a high probability of doing
for example, price get back above test the top, maybe come down one more time
it has a measured move which can be taken from this area over here, and it will take it into the region of about fifty five thousand dollars
and if price can get back above forty one thousand 000, we can start to consider those type of long positions
but for now, risk continues to remain to the downside, with price stuck below the 21 ema and, uh, targeting the key quarterly area at 40, 40, 34 700
uh, you have the 200day moving average, which is sitting right now at 40 500
so again, once we clear that previous week's week high at 41 000, that would get us back above this allimportant moving average and give bulls a chance again
i did show this as the one bullish case yesterday, which is the falling wedge pattern
its next target would take you back up again to that 41 000 level
this has been marked though, again, of course, with the bearish moon, which does have an over 80 hit rate, uh? meaning when you get the bull moon, 80 chance we're going up
you want to see if you can flip that region as support so resistance break back above
and once you clear that, that's why it's better to be late to the party than early and get completely wrecked
all right, having a look at this chart over here, you have momentum oscillators coming back up
and again, why have i chosen this main level to clear at 41 000? that's because that's an area that's, uh, historically been very sticky for both support and resistance
and not only that, is is your previous area that was local high
until then, you still have that diagonal trend line to clear, which is coming up today at 39 600
uh, i think everything is going to come down to tonight with the fomc meeting
and when we find out whether the fed is hawkish or dovish based off of that conversation, i think that's when the real market move is going to come
anything else around that is just volatility, which we expected was going to be around in any case
i'm still remaining in my stable positions, and i'll most likely take positions tomorrow based off of what the market results will be from the fomc meeting

federal reserve are due to deliver their monetary policy report for the month of may 2022
and that could force a bit of a rally in risk markets like crypto like equities, and force the us
this event also has the potential to cause capitulation in risk markets
and which way the market goes is, of course, dependent on how that event goes on wednesday
for wednesday's event, there are two components to be aware of
at 6 pm, there is the official announcement, which details the decision made by the federal reserve for this month
and there's also, at 6 30 pm utc, of the fomc press conference, where jerome powell, the head of the us
federal reserve, will talk about policy and future monetary policy in the us
so there's two components to be aware of to understand how this event is likely to play out, based on current data and current knowledge
central bank decided to hike rates by 25 basis points for the first time since 2018
leading into the march fomc meeting, the market started to price in this 25 basis point hike in anticipation of that occurring at the meeting
this resulted in lower equities, lower crypto and an overall risk off environment where the us
given that the outcome of the march 2022 federal reserve meeting was priced in ahead of time, on the release of the news that there was going to be a 25 basis point hike, the market unwound and saw some relief throughout the month of march and into early april
the reason i'm touching on the last meeting is because we're seeing a very similar dynamic right now, pricing in the outcome ahead of time
and if the market is correct in its pricing, we should see an unwind of protective positioning and the market have relief higher
currently, the market is pricing in with a 996 probability that the federal reserve deliver a 50 basis point hike on wednesday
and if that 50 basis point hike is delivered, or if anything lower than a 50 basis point hike is delivered, for instance, a 25 basis point hike, the market should see relief on the 6 pm announcement
so that covers the 6 pm announcement, where we don't get any chatter from the actual fomc themselves
they just release a document detailing what their decision is and what their updated views are on the market
i believe the market will make its real move at the 6 30 pm press conference
drone power will give us further insight into this month's decision, as well as provide further guidance on what is to come for us
powell will be also answering questions from financial journalists in the us
and that should provide us with some further insight into what he is thinking, and to what the rest of the fomc members are thinking
it's often the case that markets rally or fall into support or resistance before such a key event
bitcoin is trading around 40k, at ultimate support, and equities are again testing the lows
so you can expect wednesday to be the ultimate catalyst to push markets in either direction, whether that be risk on, where we see bitcoin and equities rally higher, or risk off, where bitcoin equities move lower and the us dollar continues to move higher through 105 and towards 110
and i think there's a pretty strong consideration for the federal reserve to make, considering that quarter one 2022 saw a period of negative growth in the us
their economy shrunk 14 percent in the first three months of 2022
and now that raises the fear of a technical recession, which would be two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth
so we've just had one negative growth quarter, and quarter two could be a second
federal reserve will do everything in their power to stop that from happening
after all, the federal reserve exists to stop these exact things from happening, stop financial catastrophes and crises from happening in the first place
you could say that gdp prints don't really play a part into the fed's thinking at the moment, and they're more likely to look at other metrics
if negative growth is hard during quarter 2 2022, that will place the us
and you know, they'll be a bit of a laughing stock of the world at that point
so the weakness in the quarter one gdp rating decreases the probability that the fed are going to be aggressive on wednesday and talk hawkishly or speak about tightening even further
and i think that could be bullish for bitcoin and bullish for crypto as a whole, as well as us
equities, moving forward into the coming weeks, into the coming months, as the fed are probably going to want to do everything in their power to stop a recession from occurring, and that would be to be more lenient and more accommodative on their monetary policy stance
in the event that the fed do this on wednesday, and they're more accommodative, we could see a macro bottom in bitcoin and a macro bottom in altcoins as well, which would be pretty damn exciting
now, touching on the other scenario that could see capitulation across risk assets and capitulation across crypto, is that power talks in an aggressive tone and commits to further rate hiking and an aggressive quantitative tightening and rolloff of the federal reserve's balance sheet
and it is on wednesday that qt, or quantitative tightening, is expected to be formally announced by the federal reserve
quantitative tightening is essentially the opposite of quantitative easing
quantitative tightening reduces the liquidity in the market, reduces cash in the market and forces tighter liquidity conditions and makes money more expensive and harder to come by
but i believe it is the anticipation of such events that holds the highest weight and makes the majority of the move
it's on that sell, the rumor by the news, type of dynamic that we see so often with the majority of macro drivers
expect any specifics around how qt is going to be carried out this time around, to be the main driver of how bitcoin and equities move on wednesday
it'll be jerome powell's messaging around that that drive the market in a direction, and could potentially decide the fate of the market on wednesday
that's how important qt is to this overall process of tightening by the federal reserve
if the market doesn't get what it expected in terms of aggression from the fed, we could see capitulation in crypto, and that would mean bitcoin to low 30ks
and at the same time, if the market sees that the overall view from the federal reserve is more accommodative and more calm, we could see a melt up in crypto
to give some context, here is what happened in 2017 to the nasdaq index, which is highly correlated with bitcoin, as you should know, when the federal reserve announced quantitative tightening back then
the market saw a little bit of a selloff on the announcement, but it was shortlived, and the market continued on its rally in 2017 and into 2018, even though quantitative tightening was occurring
so it's not the beall and endall, and it's not doom and gloom, but i think it is definitely a good idea to be prepared for all scenarios, because each one holds its weight and could very well play out on wednesday
